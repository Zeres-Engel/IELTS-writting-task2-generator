["Researchers look at meltwater at the edge of the Greenland ice sheet.For a few days in July of 2012, it was so hot in the Arctic that nearly the entire surface of the Greenland ice sheet turned to slush.It was so uncharacteristically warm that scientists, emerging from their tents high on the peak of the ice sheet, sank up to their knees in the suddenly soft snow. And then, that snow started melting.Near the edge of the ice sheet, bright blue puddles collected on the flat white surface. Rivulets of melt trickled down, braiding into fat, gushing rivers. The meltwater punched through gullies and spilled down crevasses. One river near the edge of the ice sheet was so swollen that it swept away a bridge that had been there for decades. So much water spilled out of the guts of the ice sheet that year that global sea levels rose by over a millimeter.The melting was alarming, like nothing scientists had seen before. But no one knew exactly how unusual the event was or how worried to be. But now, scientists have figured out that the hot 2012 summer capped off 20 years of unprecedented increases in meltwater runoff from Greenland. And even more concerningly, they found, melting is speeding up even faster than air temperatures warm. So yes, they found, 2012 was a particularly bad year—but it was just a preview of what might come.“The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is greater than at any point in the last three to four centuries, and probably much longer than that,” says Luke Trusel, a researcher at Rowan University in New Jersey and lead author of the new study, published today in Nature.And the effects of the melting aren’t just abstract: A complete melting of Greenland’s mile-thick ice sheets would dump seven meters (23 feet) of extra water into the world’s ocean. So what happens high in the poles matters to anyone who lives near a coast, eats food that comes through a coastal port, or makes a flight connection in an airport near the ocean, scientists warn.Scientists already knew that Greenland was melting fast; they could track its shrinking size from satellites. But the key satellite data only goes back until the early 1990s—so they couldn’t tell exactly how alarmed to be by the melting. Had this kind of jaw-dropping warming happened before? How unusual was it, compared to the time before human-caused climate change kicked into gear? No one knew.They had to figure out a way to look back in time, so they went to the source: the ice sheet itself. They fanned across the ice surface and drilled a suite of ice cores that recorded signals of how much and how intensely the surface of the ice sheet had melted over the past few hundred years. They compared that with models, which let them calculate how much runoff would result from the kind of surface melting recorded in the ice cores.And in both, they saw a clear signal. Melting and runoff started creeping upward just when the first stirrings of human-caused climate change hit the Arctic, in the mid-19th century. But the real drama unfolded in the past 20 years; suddenly, melt intensity shot up, up to nearly six-fold higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution.“It’s really like turning on a switch,” says Beata Csatho, a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo who was not a part of the study.It was also clear that melting was speeding up faster than the temperature rose. The warmer it got, the more sensitive the ice sheet was to that warming, primarily because melting at the surface changes its color.“Think of a white fluffy snowflake,” explains Trusel. “As it melts, it’s going to become a blob.”And blobs absorb more of the sun’s heat than fluffy, bright-white flakes. And the more heat they absorb, the blobbier they become, and the more they melt. “So even without any temperature change, once they get set in motion they just want to melt even more,” says Trusel.That doesn’t bode well for the future, particularly because air temperatures in the Arctic are rising faster than anywhere else on the planet.“What we're seeing right now is really unprecedented. These melt increases are driven by warming, which is caused by humans pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” says Ellyn Enderlin, a glacier scientist at the University of Maine who was not involved in the study. “The feedbacks the Earth has, the checks it has—they can't make up for that. The system can't adjust to the rate of change right now.”",
"With our polar regions rapidly shrinking—and more bad news this week—it can make one nostalgic for an Antarctica that was, well, intact.The windiest, coldest, and driest place on Earth, the continent has long attracted explorers on a quest for adventure. National Geographic Magazine in particular has a history of fascination with Antarctica, publishing its first story on the region in 1894.In 1907, National Geographic published some of the first-ever photos of the icy world. Years later, an issue published in 1924 featured photographs by Herbert Ponting and showed an intimate look at the region few had ever seen. The British photographer also documented parts of the Terra Nova expedition, led by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott from 1910-1912. (See rare pictures of Scott's expedition on the anniversary of his death.)His black-and-white images show men exploring a striking yet desolate land, clad in bulky clothing with rudimentary equipment and sled dog teams for transportation. Ponting also captured the men's daily lives in their 50-foot-long wooden hut (they ate exotic foods, like penguin and seal), giving people a glimpse of a place few ever go.Scott and his expedition party perished in 1912 while returning from the South Pole—Norwegian Roald Amundsen had beat them to it, becoming the first person to set foot at Earth's southernmost point. (Read "Race to the South Pole" in National Geographic magazine.)But Ponting, who had stayed behind, returned to the continent in the 1920s to document more of the harsh territory. He died in 1935 back in his native England.Many of Ponting's Antarctica photos never ran in the magazine, and were later obtained in auction. They show an Antarctica not seen by many—and one we may never see again. (See pictures of our melting world in National Geographic magazine.)Ponting's pictures, University of Manchester historian Max Jones said in a previous interview, present Antarctica as "a natural fortress to be besieged and conquered by man."",
"Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, is an isolated mining town built on gold and now sustained by diamonds—an outpost of civilization surrounded by a vast, austere landscape of rock and tundra and water—most notably, the enormous Great Slave Lake, on whose shore the city is built. Come for the wilderness and stay for the people, who know how to make their own fun in this raw country.When to Go: Summer in the Northwest Territories is short and sweet. Folk on the Rocks, an outdoor music festival on Long Lake and the biggest event of the season, lands in mid-July. Due to its location, Yellowknife is blessed with spectacular views of the northern lights, best seen near the fall and spring equinoxes. March is when the city celebrates winter with a pair of festivals: the Long John Jamboree is a long-weekend event featuring ice fishing, helicopter rides, crafts, and kids’ activities; the monthlong Snowking Festival is held in a genuine snow castle on frozen Great Slave Lake and includes theater and musical performances, story slams, and film screenings.How to Get Around: Downtown Yellowknife is compact and walkable, but you’ll want a rental car to explore more outlying areas. Heading further afield? You’ll probably need a floatplane.Where to Stay: The Explorer Hotel, in downtown Yellowknife, is the go-to place to stay. But if you’re keen to visit Old Town, Brent Reaney, publisher of local magazine EDGE YK, offers another option: “Bayside Bed and Breakfast is comfortably furnished and does a great eggs Benedict,” Reaney says. “Its rare waterfront location is as great in summer as it is in winter.” Want to get out on Great Slave? The Plummer family helped pioneer fly-in fishing lodges in the north—they first landed back in 1938 where their Great Slave Lake lodge now sits.Where to Eat or Drink: Yellowknife has a cluster of dining and drinking options, with most located downtown. Says Reaney: “Have a pint at the Black Knight (BK to the locals) and a plate of pan-fried pickerel at Bullock’s Bistro. In summer, hit Bullock’s early (even before five) to make sure you get a seat inside the cramped log cabin.”What to Read or Watch Before You Go: The city draws television producers like flies: Ice Road Truckers and Ice Pilots NWT and the fictional drama Arctic Air have all filmed here. “Of the Y.K.-based reality shows, Ice Pilots NWT is probably the most accurate in terms of northern weather and people's experiences in the community,” Reaney says.Helpful Link: Spectacular NWTFun Fact: Margot Kidder, of Superman’s Lois Lane fame, was born in Yellowknife.",
"After polar explorer Eric Larsen finished on the “triple crown of adventure”—traveling to the South Pole, the North Pole, and the top of Mount Everest in one year—it was hard to imagine what he might do next. But he has a plan. In December of 2012, Larson will begin another crossing of Antarctica. Once again the Minnesotan is attempting to make the 750-mile trek from the edge of the continent at the Hercules Inlet to the geographic South Pole. But this time he’s going by bicycle!If he’s successful Larsen will be the first person to complete the journey he calls Cycle South. Although British adventure athlete Helen Sketlon made the final few miles of her South Pole expedition back in January 2012 by bike, Larsen’s long pedal has yet to be accomplished. Riding a production model Surly Moonlander, a fat-tire bike made in Minnesota with 4.8-inch wheels, the trip promises to test the constitution of both man and machine through one of the harshest environments on the planet.Apart from frigid temperatures 20-degrees below zero in the Antarctic summer, sudden storms can dump vast quantities of new snow on the trail ahead. Larsen will likely encounter whiteout conditions that will make it impossible to distinguish between the snow and the horizon adding to the difficulties of navigation—it’s hard to pedal a bicycle if you can’t see. Plus there are the objective hazards of crevasses and sastrugi, wave-like ridges of ice and snow formed by wind, that can be major obstacles to a bike weighed down by heavy gear.But well familiar with the route Larsen is confident of his chances. Hoping to raise awareness for the importance bicycle travel as a way to cut down on carbon emissions from automobiles he aims to demonstrate that human-power should never be taken for granted. He wants people to know that in all kinds of weather the bicycle is an excellent alternative mode of transportation to help mitigate the long-term effects of climate change. Larson also hopes to prompt his fans and followers to contribute a little cash to support research to find a cure for Parkinson’s Disease.Larsen spared a few minutes to answers questions from James Edward Mills of the Joy Trip Project.Eric Larsen: Well, the big difference is it’s on a bike. So that really poses a lot of logistical considerations. Not only that, but the North Pole, the South Pole, and Everest, those expeditions had already been completed before by other people, myself included. Nobody has ever completed a bicycle traverse to the South Pole. There are a lot of unknowns that add another level of severity. And there are a lot of interesting and fun problems to try to solve.EL: For one thing, how to keep your feet warm. What types of boots to wear while still using clip-less pedals, which is most efficient. How to manage different types of equipment fatigue and repairs. I’ll have a standard repair kit that I use. But what can potentially break on a bike in those conditions at higher levels of severity? There’s carrying all the supplies. And navigation as well. I navigate by compass while holding it and eyeballing an identifiable snow drift or something. Navigating while on the bike and moving around over sastrugi is challenging as well.EL: It is. But I have skied this route before and it’s relatively crevasse-free. I didn’t see any, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t ski over a ton of them. There is some crevasse danger. It’s relatively minimal, so it is a concern. In a place like Antarctica it’s somewhat “terra-cognita” in the sense that there have been enough flights over this general region where a lot of the crevasse fields are known. But like I said, I skied that route in 2008. I got to the South Pole in January of 2009 so I have all my GPS points.EL: Training and preparation have always been critical for me. I have kind of a philosophy: Train hard and travel easy. And so for me it’s just been spending a lot of time just on the bike riding, which is ironically what I do for a lot of my training for cold travel like ski expeditions. So I’ve been doing a ton of biking. Honestly, it’s been a little bit more difficult because we have a baby boy who is two months old. So that’s added another level of fatigue to this overall endeavor. Getting the four and five-hour rides in has been a little more difficult. It’s been a lot more like two and three-hour rides. That’s one thing. The other is I probably spend the most time just working and solving all the gear problems, gearing up and menu planning, those kinds of things. For polar travel you know there’s generally a bunch of different modifications I do to the equipment to make sure that it’s able to withstand those conditions and also function properly.EL: I’ll probably get two to three resupplies along the way. I haven’t totally decided yet. And so I’ll be hauling about 90 pounds of gear with me as I’m traveling. I’ve been down in Antarctica before. I’ve worked for a company called Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions. They do a majority of the private expedition support in Antarctica. They also do scientific support. The NSA does most of the scientific support out of South Pole Stations in McMurdo and Palmer. They have a pretty comprehensive program and so they actually fly to the South Pole in a Twin Otter (aircraft) somewhat regularly throughout the summer season.What they’ll do is they’ll land at a kind of a rough latitude that I specify. And they’ll just open the door up real quick, they’ll take out a shovel, bury my little Granite Gear stuff sack full of food and fuel and they’ll put a little black flag on it about two feet high, mark the GPS point, and send me the GPS coordinates. If the conditions are good from about a mile away, if I’m navigating well and it’s clear, I can see that black flag. I’ll have all those bags packs prior to going over to Antarctica. Basically they’ll deposit the first one probably right away when they drop me off. And then I’ll be in contact with them just to see what the status is for the other potentially one or two resupplies. It depends on how fast or slow I’m going.EL: I think for me getting to the starting line is probably one of the biggest hurdles of any expedition. Getting this far to me and hopefully doing Antarctica is a pretty big success.That said, a big part of my expeditions are really about advocacy and trying to connect people with other issues. For me I’ve always had this choice in my life between wilderness and bicycles. It has always been a conflicting interest. This trip is interesting to me because it gets to combine my two great loves and really focus on some things that I feel are important, protecting the environment by using bicycles to reduce carbon emissions, creating awareness and raising money for Parkinson’s Disease. My dad actually had Parkinson’s Disease, and it’s something that I’ve wanted to coordinate with a trip. My focus will always be environmental, but these expeditions are good platforms to talk about whatever. And I feel like we all have this responsibility to leave the world a little bit better off, to continue with my environmental advocacy with Clif Bar and Wild Lands Alliance and a little bit with world bike organizations. To do some work with others along the way like the Davis Phinney Foundation.Davis Phinney is an ex-bike racer. He’s the first or second American to win a stage in the Tour de France. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, as my dad was diagnosed for over 20 years. He’s also based in Boulder. That’s going to be the figurehead of the expedition, trying to raise $10,000 for his organization. And then there’s the pragmatic goal of trying to bike to the South Pole.EL: I think the big thing is just that I’m healthy and the weather has been good and that I’ve made good mileage. The big part of the trip is to get to the South Pole. I’ve got about 40 days to do that. I think it could take upwards of half that time, but you know, it’s Antarctica. There’s a lot of variability. I’m relying on information that I gleaned from my prior experience and training. There are so many variable that I want to be safe in what my estimations are. And if can ride back well that’s just icing on the cake.EL: My expeditions are about telling stories. That’s my primary goal. I want to do original trips that tell good stories. The world records, the look-at-me-I’m-awesome thing, that’s not necessarily as important to me. I have a lot of different projects that I’m thinking about. I’ve been to Antarctica three different times. I’ve lead two whole trips and one partial trip to the South Pole and its an amazing place. Would I like to go back and do the full trip to the South Pole and back if I don’t finish? I don’t really know. Would I like to go back and do some other cool trips in Antarctica? Definitely.The Joy Trip Project is made possible with the support of sponsors Patagonia, Rayovac and the New Belgium Brewing Company.",
"Icebergs in Disko Bay, Greenland.Kulusuk, GreenlandA thousand feet above the glistening, iceberg-dotted water of the ocean off of East Greenland, oceanographer Josh Willis braces for balance, his feet spread wide on the metal floor of a specially-outfitted airplane. He grips a wide grey cylinder, hovering it over a 6-inch-wide bottomless tube.The pilot’s voice crackles over the intercom: “3, 2, 1, zero, DROP.”Willis lets the cylinder go. With a whoosh, it slips down the tube and into the wide-open air.The plane banks hard to the right and everyone on board rushes to a window. “I see it!” yells Ian Fenty, another oceanographer on the project, as the probe—designed to sink to the seafloor and record the properties there—splashes down.Willis, Fenty, and a crew of other scientists and pilots are flying the edge of Greenland’s vast ice sheet to figure out how the ocean eats away at the ice, speeding or slowing its slide into the water, where it melts, raising sea levels worldwide.In an airplane flying low over the eastern coast of Greenalnd, Josh Willis, the lead scientist for the Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) research project, prepares to drop a probe through a chute in the floor of a retrofitted DC-3 plane. The probe will fly through through the air and land in the coastal ocean, where it will measure the temperature and salinity of the water.But exactly how much ice it will deposit, and how fast, is still an open question. Greenland is currently the biggest contributor to global sea level rise. By 2100, will its ice sheet’s melt add inches to the world’s oceans—or will it add much more?That’s a trillion-dollar question. Nearly 70 percent of Earth’s population lives within 100 miles of a coast, and vast amounts of infrastructure—from airports to ports to cities to roads to Internet cables—sits in zones that could flood within decades. Small, low-lying island nations, city planners, insurance adjustors, homeowners—everyone is clamoring for the most accurate estimates of how much extra water they’ll need to prepare for.And for that, says Willis, they need to know what happens here, where ocean meets ice.“This is where it all happens,” he says. The flooding of the future is being defined here and now, in the glittering sea below.Greenland’s ice is shrinking, this we've known for a while, since the science of global warming, a famous climate scientist likes to say, is older than the technology that makes our iPhones fast and the Internet run smoothly.But until the 1990s, the ice in Greenland was remarkably stable, even as air temperatures rose because of human-caused climate change. Each year, the ice sheet lost some weight as ice flowed like taffy from the center of the ice sheet, through funnel-like outlet glaciers at its edge, spilling into the ocean. But enough snow fell on top of the mile-high interior of the ice sheet to balance out the losses.(See what the world would look like if all the ice melted).In the 1990s, scientists thought that the big ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica responded slowly to changes in climate, shuddering into motion like bears waking up from hibernation. Yes, they’d respond to the human-caused climate change that was gripping the planet, the thinking went, but it would take decades or even centuries to really see the impacts.“Early on, we weren’t thinking about Greenland as being really critical on these kind of decadal scales, and we didn’t have tools to look at them on those time scales,” explains Twila Moon, a glacier expert at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.But around 1997, something changed. Scientists studying Jakobshavn glacier, on Greenland’s western coast, watched in alarm as a tongue of ice that had for years poked out into a fjord started to shrink. The tongue was about 15 kilometers long in 1997. By the early 2000s—a scant half decade later—that tongue was gone.“We suspected that this could happen from time to time, but this was the first time we’d seen anything like it,” says David Holland, who led the team studying the rapid disintegration of the ice tongue.Huge chunks of ice break off the Jakobshavn glacier in Western Greenland.Today, the Greenland ice sheet is losing mass about six times faster than it was just a few decades ago, whatever tenuous balance that existed before long since upended. Between 2005 and 2016, melt from the ice sheet was the single largest contributor to sea level rise worldwide, though Antarctica may overtake it soon.Within the past 50 years, the ice sheet has already shed enough to add about half an inch of water to the world’s oceans, and that number is increasing precipitously as the planet heats. During this summer’s extreme heat wave that parked over Greenland for a week and turned over half its surface ice to slush, meltwater equivalent to over 4 million swimming pools sloughed into the ocean in a single day. Over the month of July, enough melt poured into the ocean to bump sea levels up by an easily measurable half a millimeter.(Read about how unexpected changes are occuring in the ice sheet itself).Overall, there’s enough water locked up in the Greenland ice sheet to add about 25 feet to the world’s oceans. It’s not likely that such catastrophic loss will happen soon, as in within the next few hundred years. But the whole of the ice sheet doesn’t have to collapse to cause massive, planet-wide reverberations.“When I started this research, I never would have guessed that warm subsurface waters could unravel an ice sheet,” says David Holland, an oceanographer at NYU. “But it’s becoming clear that they can, and that they are.”The ice tongue’s retreat started scientists on a Sherlock Holmes-esque quest for the culprit.At the time, most models of ice sheet dissolution more or less assumed that the ice melted from the top, when warm pockets of air parked themselves over the sheet. But it hadn’t been exceptionally warm when Jakobshavn suddenly retreated. That meant there must be another factor at play.One team of oceanographers, led by David and Denise Holland, had a collective hunch. Maybe, they thought, something changed in the water upon which the ice tongue had been floating. If the ice didn’t melt because of something warm above it, maybe it melted from below, like an ice cube in a glass of water.The problem was that Greenland’s winding, remote, ice-choked coastline is over 27,000 miles long—and there were only a few spots measured consistently. By comparison, California’s coast, about an eighth as long, has hundreds of buoys beaming out information constantly.But luckily, the Danish fisheries service had been steaming through the fjord system around Jakobshavn for years, testing water temperatures and other data that helped them understand what kind of conditions were good for fish.(Read about how the oldest fish in the sea are the most at risk).The Holland’s team pieced together bits of that data and discovered that the water in the fjords started to get warmer just when the Jakobshavn ice tongue started to retreat.So the culprit wasn’t just hot sun beating down on the surface of the ice, though that was certainly part of the problem. It was also a long, steady stream of warm ocean water that suddenly managed to reach Jakobshavn.But where did that water come from? And what would it do into the future? The questions piled up, and teams of scientists flocked to Greenland to figure it out.After the Jakobshavn discovery, it became clear that slight changes in the ocean waters here—their temperature, saltiness, or currents—could affect the ice anywhere they made contact.The OMG project flies a retrofitted DC-3 plane above the coast of Greenland. In the spring, scientists flew at 40,000 feet above the ice sheet, mapping out the shape of the glaciers below. Over the summer, they fly lower, right over the coast, dropping probes into the water near the edges of the glaciers.In the long term, that’s bad news. The ocean has done the lion’s share of soaking up the excess heat already trapped in the atmosphere by human-caused climate change, absorbing over 90 percent of all the extra warmth since the Industrial Revolution began. Over time, there will likely be more and more warm water available to melt ice.And there is plenty of ice to be melted. The snouts of some 200 Greenland glaciers poke out over the water, making them vulnerable to the same kind of oceanic edge-nibbling. Recent modeling done exclusively for National Geographic shows that if climate change continues unabated, the big glaciers—like Jakobshavn, or Helheim Glacier on the southeastern Greenland coast—would shed enough ice to add about one centimeter to the seas. Recent research also suggests that by 2100, the enough of the island's ice could slip into the sea (either as bergs or as meltwater) to send sea levels up 2 to 12 inches. By 1,000 years out, if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, the ice could be gone.The coastal glaciers are like rootlets tendriling off the taproot of Greenland’s interior, the channels through which much of the ice is lost. Ice from the interior flows out through these glaciers, eventually reaching the ocean, where it melts and contributes to sea level rise.Over the first decades of this century, scientists developed ever more sophisticated ways to measure how fast the ice was flowing. They looked at the bright white outlet glaciers with radar and visible-spectrum satellite images; they used a powerful pair of satelliites to “weigh” the ice loss as it was happening; and they built models that captured the great groaning and strain of the ice. When they got a better view of how much of ice was getting lost, they could see that many of those 200 outlet glaciers were shrinking—just like Jakobshavn.Maybe, Willis and his colleagues hypothesized, the answer was, once again, the ocean.So they schemed up a project. They’d need to know a few things: what was happening with the ice on land (fine, they’d fly a plane over the ice margin and track its activity with radar). They needed to know what the bathymetry underneath the ice looked like, both on land and in the water. Was the ice reaching deep down, like a fat wine cork stopping up the fjord? Or was it a thin layer? (OK, they’d send ships up into the fjords to measure the bottom depth).And finally, they needed to know what was going on with the water itself. Was it warm? Where? And why? For that, they’d have to get some sensors in the water—by dropping them, they decided, from a fixed-up, tricked-out DC-3 plane originally built in 1942.In 2015, they powered up their planes and boats and got to science-ing. A picture quickly came together. “When we started looking, we saw these fjords that were 200, 400, 800 meters deep!” exclaims Fenty.The retrofitted DC-3 plane the OMG team flies on was built in 1942, for the Canadian Air Force. Here, it takes off  from the Kulusuk airport in East Greenland for a day flight over the nearby coast.And the water around the coast? Parts of it were often shockingly warm—sometimes up to 10 degrees Celsius or more, well above the just-above-freezing temperatures they expected, he says.That setup creates a perfect environment for melting ice. In this part of the ocean, water at the surface tends to be chilly and fresh. But if you dived down a few hundred feet, you’d hit a warm, salty layer—a current, part of the Gulf Stream, that comes straight from the tropics with the warmth of the equatorial sun in its watery bonds.Much of the time, the Greenland coast is insulated from that warm water. A wide shelf around the edge of the island acts like a seawall blocking the water from coming in contact with the ice. But sometimes, when long-term weather patterns slip into a particular mode, it can spill over the wall. And once it’s there, it can spill into the deep fjords. And once it’s in the fjords, it can get all the way to the ice front.At the ice front, the glaciers fill the deep fjords like huge ice corks in a bottle. But the corks are delicate. Each hit of warm water eats away at them a little more. Just a few days later on that research junket, the scientists watched a particularly dramatic example. As they flew low over the leading edge of the massive Helheim glacier, aiming to drop a probe through a hole in the in the mélange of giant bergs floating at the glacier’s snout, they saw water roiling up through the hole “like a bubbling cauldron,” says Willis.When the probe pinged back data, it showed a warm wall of water extending straight down 2,000 meters to the bottom of the fjord: A solid wall of water ready to melt the glacier.Each year since 2015, the team has dropped about 250 probes into the ocean around the edge of Greenland. They’ve found the toasty water nosed up to the end of glaciers around the island most of the time in most of the places.Many of the glaciers on the Greenland coast stretch all the way to the sea, but some are already isolated. The ones that reach the ocean can melt quickly if they come into contact with warm water.And the exceptions, they think, prove the rule. At Jakobshavn, for example, they saw the water cool down for a few years—and the glacier responded in kind, slowing its retreat. But that just strengthened their hypothesis, says Willis, making it even clearer that the ocean acts as the “main control on that glacier.” The system is at the whim of water.On the plane, the data starts beaming back to Fenty’s screen a few minutes after the drop. Near the surface, the ocean is just barely above freezing. But as the probe sinks—100 meters, 200, 400, 500—the familiar signal appears, indicating warm water.“There it is,” says Fenty. “It’s there again, that Atlantic water.”The warm layer has intruded upon most of this part of the coast for most of the years the team has been dropping probes. But that’s partly a product of a weather cycle that influences the wind and ocean currents around the island. Currently, the cycle is in a phase that lets warm Atlantic water slosh toward Greenland instead of being pushed cleanly toward Europe. When the phase flipped briefly, the currents around the island cooled down—and hence Jakobshavn slowed its melting.Changes to the cycle, like many other atmospheric and oceanic patterns, hasn’t been directly linked to climate change yet. But there are some hints that the phase that causes warm water to get up to the edge of the ice is getting more prevalent.“I think the bottom line is, in a warming planet, we expect the glaciers to retreat and the ice sheet to change, a lot,” says Fiamma Straneo, an oceanographer at Scripps Institute of Oceanography. “Greenland tends to be an integrator of the climate signal. What we’re seeing is the effects of a warmer atmosphere over the Arctic—as well as probably a warmer ocean.”",
"Sea ice meets land as seen from a research aircraft over Greenland. Greenland's ice sheet is retreating due to warming temperatures and scientists are seeing the ice start to melt in new and alarming ways.When the remnants of Europe’s second summertime heat wave migrated over Greenland in late July, more than half of the ice sheet’s surface started melting for the first time since 2012. A study published Wednesday in Nature shows that mega-melts like that one, which are being amplified by climate change, aren’t just causing Greenland to shed billions of tons of ice. They’re causing the remaining ice to become denser.“Ice slabs”—solid planks of ice that can span hundreds of square miles and grow to be 50 feet thick—are spreading across the porous, air pocket-filled surface of the Greenland ice sheet as it melts and refreezes more often. From 2001 to 2014, the slabs expanded in area by about 25,000 square miles, forming an impermeable barrier the size of West Virginia that prevents meltwater from trickling down through the ice. Instead, the meltwater becomes runoff that flows overland, eventually making its way out to sea.As the ice slabs continue to spread, the study’s authors predict more and more of Greenland’s surface will become a “runoff zone,” boosting the ice sheet’s contribution to global sea level rise and, perhaps, causing unexpected changes.“We're watching an ice sheet rapidly transform its state in front of our eyes, which is terrifying,” says lead study author Mike MacFerrin, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder.It’s easy to think of Greenland as a solid, impenetrable hunk of ice. But in reality about 80 percent of the ice sheet’s surface is like a snowcone: A dusting of fresh snowfall covers a thick layer of old snow, called firn, that’s slowly being compressed into glacier ice but still contains plenty of air pockets. When the top of this snow cone melts in the summer, liquid water percolates down into the firn, which soaks it up like a 100-foot-thick sponge.MacFerrin and his colleagues got their first hint that the firn may be losing its absorbency in the spring of 2012, when they were drilling boreholes through the firn in southwest Greenland. They started finding dense, compacted layers of ice in core after core, just below the seasonal snow layer. It was, MacFerrin says, as if a “turtle shell” had formed over the firn.MacFerrin and his colleagues immediately wondered whether that shell might be preventing meltwater from percolating into the firn.“That was May of 2012,” MacFerrin says. “And July was this record-breaking melt year, and we got our answer very quickly.”That summer, for the first time on record, meltwater from this part of Greenland visibly started to flow away as runoff.Realizing they had witnessed something significant, the researchers set about drilling more cores over a larger region to see how extensive the ice shell was. They discovered that it spanned a transect 25 miles long and was having widespread effects on local hydrology.Those findings, published in 2016 in Nature Climate Change, were the springboard for the new study. Using radar data from NASA’s IceBridge airborne campaign, as well as ground-based surveys, MacFerrin and his colleagues have now created a first-of-its-kind map of ice slabs across the entire surface of Greenland.Based on modelling results, the researchers think the shell began to form and spread widely in the early 2000s. As of 2014, it covered some 4 percent of Greenland’s surface, according to the new analysis. Every summer that extensive melting occurs, it gets thicker and spreads inland to colder, higher ground.“Every handful of years, these big melt summers are doing a number on the firn,” MacFerrin says. “That’s causing this whole process to grow inland pretty quickly.”This photo is a segment of a firn core, essentially a baby ice slab that eventually will grow into a meters-thick slab of ice.Ice slabs have already caused Greenland’s runoff zone to expand by about 26 percent, according to the new study. So far the additional runoff has only added about a millimeter to global sea levels. Greenland now contributes a little under a millimeter per year to rising sea levels, through a combination of icebergs breaking off glaciers and melt occurring at the surface and base of the ice sheet.But if Greenland’s surface hardens more, runoff could rise dramatically. Under a worst-case scenario where carbon emissions continue to climb until the end of the century, the researchers calculated that ice slab proliferation could add up to 3 inches of sea level rise by 2100, boosting the ice sheet’s overall sea level rise contribution by nearly a third. In both a middle-of-the-road scenario where emissions peak by mid-century and the high emissions one, the amount of runoff from Greenland’s interior roughly doubles by century’s end.But more runoff is only one potential consequence of the transformation taking place in Greenland’s ice. Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at the University of Buffalo who wasn’t involved in the study, pointed out that slabs of solid ice aren’t nearly as reflective as bright white snowfall.“And so, if we start getting these ice slabs forming near the ice sheet’s surface, it could potentially...cause the ice sheet to absorb more solar radiation and warm up,” she says. “And that would create more ice slabs.”And runoff from ice slabs doesn’t have to flow into the ocean, said Indrani Das, a glaciologist at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the study. She worries about how it could seep into the large crevasses that exist at lower elevations on the ice sheet. From there, the runoff could, potentially, flow all the way down to bedrock, lubricating the zone where the ice makes contact with it.“That could make the ice sheet flow faster,” Das says, which could cause glaciers to spill their contents into the ocean more quickly, like ice cream sliding off a piece of cake.To Poinar, the most significant contribution of the new study is that it will allow scientists to improve their projections of future sea level rise, giving coastal communities the information they need to prepare. At the same time, the study highlights the fact that the more carbon we spew into the atmosphere, the more we’re likely to transform Earth’s northern ice sheet in insidious and unexpected ways. And that could have consequences that are difficult to anticipate.“We have never observed an ice sheet behaving this way before,” Poinar says. “It’s unprecedented in human scientific history.”",
"Summer meltwater collects in a lake on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet.On the Greenland ice sheet, high at the top of the planet, things are not well.The heat wave that wreaked havoc on Europe in late July has now migrated northward, parking itself over Greenland. As air temperatures over the ice rise, the ice sheet is responding in the only way it knows how: by melting. By Tuesday, over half of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet had softened to slush.This is the second major hot stretch to hit the ice sheet this season, and the second to cause melting across major swaths of the ice sheet. The heat waves were particularly impactful because they arrived after mild, dry winter and spring seasons that primed the ice sheet for melt. The result of this brutal setup is a summer melt season so intense that it’s on track to tie or break the record for the most water loss ever recorded.Already, the melt extent is well outside the range of what’s normally observed at this time of year, said Ruth Mottram, a polar scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.“These are records we don’t want to see broken,” she says.So far, 2019 is shaping up to rival the worst melt year on record: 2012.At its worst point, in July of 2012, 97 percent of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet was experiencing some sort of melt, scientists estimated—even the icy, more-than-mile-high interior of the ice sheet, which rarely had been seen to soften.Melt coursing off the ice sheet caused rivers to gush so intensely that they blew out bridges in coastal towns. Scientists stepped outside their stations only to sink deep into the unexpectedly soft surface.By the end of July 2012, the ice sheet had lost about 250 billion tons of melt, enough to tick global sea levels up by about eight tenths of a millimeter.That’s pretty close to the estimated 248 billion tons that have been lost so far this year, according to observations made by Marco Tedesco, a polar scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.“We’re basically on pace. We’re in the ballpark of the 2012 record,” he says.On Tuesday alone, the ice sheet shed about seven billion tons of melt. That’s enough water to fill almost three billion Olympic swimming pools, and about 1.75 times as much as it might lose per day in the average year.That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up quickly. Global average sea levels have crept up by 7 to 8 inches over the past century, with about 40 percent of that rise occurring since 1993. Melting ice contributes more and more to that rise each year, and the rate of melt has potentially sextupled since 1979.By 2100, accelerating ice loss and surface melting from Greenland’s ice could dump somewhere between about 2 to 13 inches of extra water into the seas. If the whole ice sheet were to melt away—not something likely to happen in the near future in any scientific projections—global sea levels would rise by about 23 feet.This season alone won’t make or break global sea levels. But this season, on top of many others like it, will have an impact.Parts of the Greenland ice sheet melt every summer, as Earth tilts its northern face toward the sun. At the edges of the ice sheet, that translates to gushing rivers and limpid blue pools of meltwater dotting the ice’s surface.But usually, the melt is confined to those fringes, and the loss from melt is balanced—at least partially—by snowfall. Fresh snow also helps the ice sheet stay bright and reflective, bouncing away incoming solar radiation. Older snow, explains Mottram, loses the sharp snowflake edges and fluffy texture that help reflect away the light, instead congealing in a more solid, less-reflective mass that soaks up the sun’s heat.Over the winter, very little snow fell across the western edge of the ice sheet. That meant that great swaths of the ice sheet were already darker than normal when the summer heat started to set in.So when the first heat wave of the summer arrived in June, up to about 45 percent of the ice sheet hit a melting point—well above the 10 percent usually observed at that time of year. Air temperatures hovered some 10 to 15 degrees Celsius above normal. During that one hot nine-day stretch, the ice sheet lost about 80 billion tons of melt. By the time the heat passed, scientists were speculating that this season could break records.And because partially melted ice is darker than fresh snow, that event meant that the ice sheet was vulnerable to any more heat waves that might come along.“It’s like a kind of preconditioning for later melt,” says Mottram.When the most recent heat wave started to move north, scientists were prepared to see massive melting start up again across the island. So far, the scenario is playing out how they predicted.Scientists already know that climate change has a hand in lengthening and intensifying the melt seasons in Greenland; in 2012, melting around the edges of the ice sheet started about a month earlier than it had three decades prior.The big question, though, is whether this kind of extreme summer melt will soon become commonplace.Some scientists, like Xavier Fettweis, an ice sheet modeler at the University of Liège, think so.The volume and intensity of melting occurring today, he says, is on par with what models predict will occur nearly every summer by 2050. So record-breaking summers like this one, or 2012, will cease to be remarkable. We’re already on that path, he says.“This is not just one hot summer among a lot of cool ones,” he said. “This kind of anomaly has been repeated this year, and similarly in 2016, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2008, and so on.”The exact details of why melting is accelerating across the ice sheet are still being worked out. But part of the reason, some scientists think, has to do with the jet stream, the wavy band of air currents that snakes around the planet, locking into place weather patterns on either side of it.The shape of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream is at least partly controlled by the difference in temperature between the equator and the Arctic. The Arctic has warmed much more rapidly than the rest of the planet—some 1.8 degrees Celsius in the last 20 years alone—and some scientists think that the result is a jet stream that is wavier and more sluggish than before.That means that weather patterns—like the heat wave that baked Europe last week, or the devastating rains that flooded the U.S. Midwest in the spring—get stuck in place for longer, said Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at Woods Hole Research Center.And in turn, that means more opportunity for melting when the hot phases get stuck over Greenland.“We’ve seen these records falling more rapidly as time goes on,” says Francis. “They’re very clearly connected to the extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—they’re a very obvious symptom of climate change.”",
"A NOAA satellite captures an image of clouds associated with a summertime cold front that was caused by a July dip in the jet stream.Jet streams are fast-moving currents of air that circulate above the Earth. When people refer to "the jet stream" they are usually referring to the polar-front jet stream or the subtropical jet stream, two major jet streams that shape weather patterns around the world.Jet streams travel in the tropopause—the area between the troposphere and the stratosphere—at heights of about 8 to 15 kilometers (5 to 9 miles). The strong air currents, which tend to look like wavy, striated rivers when seen on a jet stream map, form when cold air and hot air meet. Their winds blow from west to east at speeds that range from 129 to 225 kilometers per hour (80 to 140 miles per hour), but they can reach more than 443 kilometers per hour (275 miles per hour).Jet streams are stronger in winter in the northern and southern hemispheres, because that's when air temperature differences that drive them tend to be most pronounced. The polar-front jet stream forms at about 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, while the subtropical jet stream forms at about 30 degrees.Shifting jet stream patterns can have a big impact on the weather. Jet streams are always changing: moving to higher or lower altitudes, breaking up, and shifting in flow, depending on the season and other variables, such as energy coming from the sun. During winter, jet streams tend to follow the sun's elevation and move toward the equator, while they move back toward the poles in spring.Air north of a jet stream is typically colder, while air to the south is usually warmer. As jet streams dip or break off, they move air masses around, creating shifts in global weather patterns. A large buckle in the jet stream, for example, is what pulled Hurricane Sandy ashore in New Jersey in 2012.Jet streams travel in the tropopause—the area between the troposphere and the stratosphere—at heights of about 5 to 9 miles (8 to 15 kilometers). The strong air currents, which tend to look like wavy, striated rivers when seen on a jet stream map, form when cold air and hot air meet. Their winds blow from west to east at speeds that range from 80 to 140 miles per hour (129 to 225 kilometers per hour), but they can reach more than 275 miles per hour (443 kilometers per hour).Rising global temperatures from global warming are affecting the jet stream and, in turn, the weather. Because the Earth's polar regions are warming more quickly than the rest of the world, the temperature contrast that drives jet streams has decreased. Slower, weaker jet streams have been linked to melting in Greenland and a potential rise in deadly weather events because they can lock weather systems into place, stalling them over regions.Studies also have linked a warming Arctic with more severe winter weather in the United States, even though other reports note that on average, winter cold snaps are actually getting warmer because of climate change. Part of this link involves the polar vortex, a swirling low-pressure center at the North and South poles. An unstable polar vortex can expand and send cold Arctic air into the jet stream, leading to frigid winter weather and storms southward.",
"A pedestrian walks across the street in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania January 20 after a major winter storm brought some of the coldest temperatures of the season and covered a large swath of the country in snow. It wreaked havoc on air travel and caused slick road conditions throughout New England.A record-breaking cold snap is relentlessly descending on parts of the U.S. this month. It spawned from a split polar vortex that sent cold, Arctic air across the continent.In a time when climate change is discussed in the context of record highs, droughts, and wildfires, cold weather and blizzards can seem out of place. For those who deny that climate change is happening, it's an opportunity to undermine scientific consensus.How do you explain a cold winter in a world that scientists say is getting hotter?A supercell thunderstorm strikes in South Dakota. Among the most severe storms, supercells can bring strong winds, hail, and even tornadoes. (See more extreme weather pictures.)First, it's important to understand the difference between climate and weather. Climate is defined as the average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time. It's the difference between Europe's temperate and Mediterranean zones versus the harsh cold conditions of the Arctic tundra. Each of these climate regions experiences day-to-day fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, air pressure, and so on—daily variations known as weather.When the term global warming was popularized a few decades ago, it referred to the phenomenon of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere and warming the average temperature of the planet. Though record high temperatures in many places have been one impact of this decades-long shift, scientists now understand that an atmosphere changed by rising levels of gases like carbon and methane leads to more climate changes than just warming.Scientists believe Earth will experience more extreme, disastrous weather as the effects of climate change play out.In response to President Trump's January 20 tweet about cold temperatures, Potsdam University physicist Stefan Rahmstorf noted on Twitter that, while North America was experiencing cold Arctic air, the rest of the world was abnormally hot. And, the polar vortex bringing that cold air to the U.S. may actually become increasingly unstable, Rahmstorf noted.As more Arctic air flows into southern regions, North America can expect to see harsher winters. That was the conclusion of a study published in 2017 in the journal Nature Geoscience. It found a link between warmer Arctic temperatures and colder North American winters. A separate study published in March of last year in the journal Nature Communications found the same link but predicted the northeastern portion of the U.S. would be particularly hard hit.“Warm temperatures in the Arctic cause the jet stream to take these wild swings, and when it swings farther south, that causes cold air to reach farther south. These swings tend to hang around for awhile, so the weather we have in the eastern United States, whether it’s cold or warm, tends to stay with us longer," said study author Jennifer Francis in a press release.Record cold temperatures and blizzards aren't the only extreme weather patterns expected.High altitude, east-to-west winds known as jet streams rely on the difference between cold Arctic air and warm tropical air to propel them forward. As the air in the Arctic warms, those jet streams slow and prevent normal weather patterns from circulating—floods last longer and droughts become more persistent. One study published in Science Advances last October predicted extreme, deadly weather events could increase by as much as 50 percent by 2100.But we don't have to wait until 2100 to see how climate change is leading to deadly weather.Scientists have already found climate change contributed to California's historic, deadly wildfires and powerful, destructive hurricanes.",
"Fires are natural in California: Many of its ecosystems, from the chaparral of Southern California to the northern pine forests, evolved to burn frequently. But since the 1980s, the size and ferocity of the fires that sweep across the state have trended upward. Fifteen of the 20 largest fires in California history have occurred since 2000.The graphic above shows why: Most of the state’s hottest and driest years have occurred during the last two decades as well.Over the past century, California has warmed by about three degrees Fahrenheit. That extra-warmed air sucks water out of plants and soils, leaving the trees, shrubs, and rolling grasslands of the state dry and primed to burn.That vegetation-drying effect compounds with every degree of warming, explains Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, meaning that plants lose their water more efficiently today than they did before climate change ratcheted up California's temperatures.Because of this effect of climate change, wildfires are increasing in size, both in California and across the western U.S., says Park Williams, a fire expert at Columbia University. Since the 1980’s, he and a colleague reported in 2016, climate change contributed to an extra 10 million acres of burning in western forests— an area about the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined.Changes in precipitation are another factor. California's summer dry season has also been lengthening. Each extra day lets plants dry out more, increasing their susceptibility to burning.“Usually—or, I don't want to even say usually anymore because things are changing so fast—we get some rains around Halloween that wet things down,” says Faith Kearns, a scientist at University of California Institute for Water Resources in Oakland. But in the past few years, those rains haven't come until much later in the autumn—November, or even December.  That may seem like a minor issue, but it has big effects. In the fall, California is often buffeted by whipping winds. So if a fire gets sparked, it can spread fast and hard. That's what happened this year, as well as in last year's Thomas fire.“We've been lengthening fire season by shortening the precipitation season, and we're warming throughout,” says Swain. “That's essentially what’s enabled these recent fires to be so destructive, at times of the year when you wouldn't really expect them.”The total number of wildfires in California hasn’t increased; in fact the numbers were a lot higher in the 1980s and 1990s than in the past decade. The total acreage burned fluctuates considerably from year to year, depending on many factors, including luck: Rain dampens things down early, or fires start in places where they are easier to contain.But climate change is driving a clear trend: When wildfires happen in California, they have a better chance of growing large and destructive.“These same fires today are occurring in a world roughly three degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it would have been without warming,” says Williams. “Which means that the current fires are probably harder to fight than they would have been in a cooler world.”",
"Above the Arctic hovers a counter-clockwise spinning mass of cold air that grows and shrinks with the changing seasons—the polar vortex.When this vortex dips toward the equator, it brings with it blasts of freezing air.The record-breaking cold front heading into the continental U.S. is the result of an unusually far south polar vortex says Bob Ovarec, a lead weather forecaster with the National Weather Service."As that system is reforming to the south, it’s helping push all the cold air south and eastward, so a lot of parts of the country are going to see some dramatic temperature changes," says Ovarec.In extreme cold, frostbite can attack exposed skin in minutes, and prolonged exposure leads to hypothermia. At least 21 people died as a result of a 2019 polar vortex outbreak.The polar vortex is a well-documented, long-existing pattern, but some scientists say climate change could be making it unstable, with potentially serious consequences.The vortex is constantly spinning in a counter-clockwise direction around the North Pole. During the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the edge of the vortex sits at a higher latitude, and in winter months, it edges south.At the bottom edge of the vortex is the polar front, or polar jet stream. The polar jet stream moves from west to east, which is why the northeastern portions of North America are often hit the hardest by polar vortex weather. (Read about the difference between weather and climate.)Jet streams are propelled forward by temperature differences and the Earth's rotation. Wider temperature differences create faster-moving winds.Those jet streams tend to sit at the same altitudes that planes fly, 30,000 feet off the ground, and pilots will often catch them to travel faster and save fuel. Jet streams can also usher in weather changes like cold fronts and heat waves.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a strong polar jet stream moving roughly along the same latitude as the vortex makes the vortex more stable and traps cold Arctic air within the Arctic Circle. But occasionally the polar jet stream weakens, moving around the globe in a wavy pattern called arctic oscillations with peaks and troughs that allow warmer southern air to move north, and cold Arctic air to rush south.This photo from Jan. 27, 2019 was taken by the NOAA-20 satellite. Signs of the polar vortex that plunged parts of the U.S. into frigid weather show up as "cloud streets" over the Great Lakes. The extremely cold air moves over the unfrozen, relatively warmer lake water, creating cumulus clouds that can deliver heavy lake effect snow.Scientists are studying how warming temperatures will influence weather patterns like winter storms. Overall, winter is the fastest warming season for a majority of people living in the U.S.But whether the polar vortex will become more likely to send cold air south as the planet warms is an area of active scientific research and debate. The question largely centers over how warming temperatures at the poles will affect the polar jet stream.Scientists are now finding that the Earth is warming more quickly at the poles than at the mid-latitude regions, meaning the temperature contrast that drives jet streams has decreased.A study published in the journal Nature in 2018 linked warmer-than-average Arctic temperatures to cold weather outbreaks in the eastern U.S. And another study published in the journal Science in 2021 found Arctic warming may increasingly disrupt the polar vortex itself, rather than the jet stream.",
"A surprisingly happy and healthy ecosystem of algae is not only turning parts of the Greenland ice sheet pinkish-red, it’s contributing more than a little to the melting of one of the biggest frozen bodies of water in the world.The discolored snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon. “It’s actually a global occurrence,” says Alexandre Anesio, a biogeochemist from the University of Bristol.Gentoo penguins make their way to and from their nests at Port Charcot, Antarctica.“In order for them to form visible blooms and increase the melting of the snow and ice, they just need the right conditions, which at a minimum involve basic nutrients and melting,” says Anesio. “As the climate gets warmer, the availability of liquid water from snow and ice becomes higher, favoring the growth of snow and ice algae.”“I think that this is increasingly becoming a problem in Arctic, Alpine, and Himalayan glaciers," Anesio says. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica, too.And experts are not accounting for the effect in their projections of global sea level rise, despite increasing evidence of what darkening snow is doing to the world's glaciers.Martyn Tranter is a polar biogeochemist at the University of Bristol in the U.K. and leader of "Black and Bloom," a multi-year project that aims to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. “Warming temperatures alone cannot explain the increased melt. So it’s become crucial to understand all the drivers in the ice melting,” he says.One of those drivers, he believes, is the darkening caused by the algal blooms that quilt the snow-strewn Greenland ice every summer.“These ice algae are photosynthetic organisms that produce biological sunscreen molecules to protect them from the sun, which in the Arctic in summer stays above the horizon up to 24 hours a day,” explains Tranter, which effectively darkens the ice surface.The darker surface lowers its “albedo,” or its ability to reflect the sunlight back into space, and that results in more light absorbed and more melting.As algae spreads over larger areas of the ice sheet, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting. A recent study found that algal blooms can contribute as much as 13 percent more ice melt over a season.“It’s a vicious circle, as often happens with climate change,” says Joseph Cook, a glacier researcher from University of Sheffield in the U.K. and a member of the Black and Bloom team. “More heat means more meltwater and yet a larger area where algae can grow, causing more ice to get darker and more of it to melt.”The Greenland ice sheet is the biggest piece of ice in the Northern Hemisphere. Each year, it loses 270 billion tons of ice as the planet heats up, adding a fraction of an inch to global sea levels. The amount of melting is speeding up year by year, and if the entire ice sheet melted, it would add 20 feet to sea levels.Scientists are worried that if it melts more quickly its effects will be felt in coastal areas from New York to Shanghai to Miami, as well as in low-lying areas like Bangladesh and Indonesia.So far, the blooms have not been taken into account as a contributing factor to Arctic ice melting at an unprecedented rate. The possibility, for instance, was not included in the estimates for sea level rise published by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latest report in 2013.Tranter wants that to change. “Our mission is to put firm numbers on it—how much darkening? Over how much area? Leading to how much melt? These are the questions that will enable us to estimate how much melt might occur because of that and so improve our sea level rise forecasts,” he says.One summer a few years ago Tranter was working on the southwestern margins of the Greenland ice sheet when he noticed a mauve shade on the melting ice surface around him.“At first, I thought it was because I was wearing a pair of pink-colored cycling glasses instead of my customary glacier goggles. But the more I looked, the more patterning I could see in the ice surface,” Tranter says.Gradually, he realized that there were microbes growing in the ice. But when he mentioned it to others on the research team, they teased him, since his observation ran counter to the general view that Arctic ice and snow is sterile and lifeless.Undeterred, Tranter asked Marion Yallop, an algae specialist and colleague who was coming to work at the same site, to take a look at the ice under the microscope. What she found confirmed Tranter’s suspicion: Just beneath the ice surface lived red algae that was turning the ice pinkish.Her observations served as a stepping stone for launching the Black and Bloom project, a $4 million, five-year, cross-disciplinary undertaking to study the role that microorganisms like pigmented bacteria and algae living in meltwater play in darkening the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, and hastening its melt.The project is now in its third year. To date, the project has run three of a planned four field expeditions to the so-called dark zone, a vast area on the western edge of the ice sheet where albedo reduction has been the greatest. Data from the expeditions has been presented and published, and there are more studies to come, Tranter says.Says Anesio, who is also part of the Black and Bloom team: “Overall, I do think that our understanding of the controls of ice algae growth on Greenland will help us to predict their growth on other glaciated regions of the Earth.”",
"An Atlantic cod swims through a kelp-forested peak on the highest underwater range in the Gulf of Maine, Cashes Ledge.Humans are killing the oldest fish in the sea, a new study suggests. That is likely altering ocean food webs and making populations of many important species eaten by people less stable and resilient.In one of the first studies of its kind, a team of fish experts used models and fish-catch data to analyze 63 major fish populations around the United States and Europe, from Atlantic cod and Greenland halibut to rockfish, hake, grouper, and sole. They found significant declines in the oldest fish in nearly 80 percent of the populations. In roughly one-third, the number of older fish had declined by more than 90 percent.It didn't matter whether the species were long-lived yelloweye rockfish, which can survive more than 100 years; red snapper, which typically reach about 50; or Pacific cod, which rarely live past age 18. Some herring might only live seven years. Yet in most cases, even where fishing is thought to be sustainable, the more senior members of the population—the oldest one-third—were being wiped out."It's worrisome," says lead author Lewis Barnett, a postdoctoral researcher with the University of Washington and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. "It's important to have young and old fish because changing environmental conditions might favor one over the other in any given year."Older fish may eat different things and live in different areas of the ocean from their younger counterparts. Many fish settle as juveniles in kelp or mangrove beds then move offshore. Older fish also tend be better at producing viable offspring—offspring that tend to be larger. Killing too many older fish can make the rest of the population more susceptible to disease, rising temperatures, or pollution, and can put the entire population at greater risk of collapse, researchers suggests.Just like protecting the oldest trees in an old-growth forest, "biodiversity translates to more stability," Barnett says.The idea that fishing brings more harm to the oldest of a species isn't itself new. But the new research is "one of the first to document how widespread the problem is," says Villy Christensen, a professor at the Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia, who wasn't involved in the study. "We must rebuild fish populations to include healthy proportions of older individuals as a hedge against population crashes."The authors of the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, only looked at fish populations off the two continents with the best data. But the findings were so consistent they expect results would be similar for important fish off Asia, Africa and South America. And fishing in developing nations is often less regulated. As a result, the authors write, "globally, the magnitude of reduction of old fishes is likely larger than the estimates we present here."The problem is actually quite simple. Few fishing methods distinguish between young fish and old fish, so most commercial operations wind up hauling in fish of many ages. Over time, all fish are exposed repeatedly to nets or hooks. As they age, fewer and fewer of the older ones escape being caught. They are disproportionately reduced in number."I think the pattern is likely to be prevalent any place that has a lot of fishing," says co-author Trevor Branch, a University of Washington fisheries biologist. "The big picture is, if you fish stuff, there are going to be fewer old fish, even if you think you're doing everything right. We're managing them for overall biomass, without realizing we've completely changed their age structure."For example, he says, Pacific whiting (also called hake), one of the biggest fisheries along the West Coast of the U.S., is considered well-managed. The fish is used in fish sandwiches, frozen fish sticks, omega-3 oils and surimi. Whiting numbers currently are quite high. Yet researchers found that fishing had taken more than 90 percent of the oldest age group."If you don't like that," Branch says, "then we have to change the way we manage fisheries."One way is to adopt so-called slot limits—limits on catching fish above a certain size. That would tend to protect older members of a population. But it can also be complex and expensive, both for the industry and regulators. An alternative is to rotate fishing zones season after season, much as farmers rotate crops, to give some areas a chance to recover.But perhaps the simplest way of protecting old fish is one that has earned more attention in recent years: establish marine reserves. By protecting more areas as no-fishing zones, you assure some portion of the senior age class is never in danger of being caught."I'm a firm proponent that some areas should be set aside," Branch says. "To keep old fish, you're going to have to give up some portion of the catch."But, he adds, that might be the best way to make sure that fish are around to catch for years to come."Consider it an insurance policy," he says.",
"The oceans of the world are warming up, their average temperatures pushed higher and higher each year by human-caused global warming.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution a few hundred years ago, humans have burned massive amounts of fossil fuels; cut down huge swaths of forest; and undertaken many other activities that pump heat-trapping carbon dioxide into Earth’s atmosphere. In response, the planet has warmed up.Only about one percent of all that trapped heat has stayed in the atmosphere, but it’s had a huge effect, warming up the air by Earth’s surface by about 1°F (0.6°C) on average over the past two centuries.Most of the rest of the trapped heat has been absorbed into the planets’ vast oceans. Since the 1970s, the oceans have sopped up more than 90 percent of all the excess heat energy trapped by CO2. Because the oceans are enormous, and because water takes much more energy to heat up than air, that translates to a temperature increase of a little more than one degree Fahrenheit, on average, over the past century.But the warming is speeding up. The top part of the ocean is warming up about 24 percent faster than it did a few decades ago, and that rate is likely to increase in the future.Every little bit of warming, however small, has enormous impacts on marine life, storm intensity, and more.The uppermost part of the ocean, down to about 2,300 feet (700 meters), has absorbed the bulk of the extra heat. The bottom few thousand feet of the ocean are not immune; they’ve sucked up another third of that excess warmth. But the uppermost skin of the sea, down to about 250 feet, is warming up the fastest, heating up by an average of about 0.11 degrees Celsius each decade since the 1970s.Marine heat waves—the oceanic version of the sweltering heat events that ripple across Earth’s surface—are also increasing in frequency and strength, with the number of days that qualify as a heatwave increasing by more than 50 percent over the past century. During these hot events, temperatures near the surface of the ocean can spike up to several degrees above the average.Most ocean dwellers, from plankton to fish to whales, live in the upper section of the ocean, squarely in the zone where temperatures are increasing quickest. Many of these marine organisms are sensitive to even slight or short-lived changes in temperature.An iceberg melts in the waters off Antarctica. Climate change has accelerated the rate of ice loss across the continent.Corals, for example, are highly attuned to the temperature of the water in which they live. Warming of only about one degree Celsius can stress them out, causing them to “bleach.” That means they spit out the symbiotic algae that live inside them and usually provide them with much of their energy. Sometimes, corals can recover from these bleaching events. Other times, they can’t.Scientists predict that warmer oceans will make storms like hurricanes and tropical cyclones more intense in the future, increasing the likelihood that they’ll reach category 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson storm-strength scale; speeding up the rate at which they intensify; and increasing the likelihood that they’ll release enormous volumes of rain.Warm water takes up more space than cool. As the oceans have heated up, they’ve expanded; as they get bigger, sea levels creep up.Between 1971 and 2010, this heat-driven sea-level rise added about eight tenths of a millimeter to the height of the ocean each year. Thermal expansion has contributed to about half of all the sea-level rise observed across the planet so far—more, up until now, than contributed by melting ice from either Greenland or Antarctica or the other glaciers of the world. But those masses of ice are melting fast and are likely to overtake heat-driven water expansion as the primary contribution to global sea-level rise.",
"Enter the ocean and you are likely to be swimming among thousands of tiny creatures —larvae of fish, octopus, sea urchins, crustaceans—newly hatched and on their way to maturing into adults. Along with plants and other organisms, these beings form the base of the marine food chain, giving and sustaining life.Photographer Ryo Minemizu has spent 20 years diving off the coast of Japan, perfecting a proprietary technique for revealing the intricate beauty of these creatures. His series of images, The Secret World of Plankton, recently won him the Nikkei National Geographic Photo Prize.Visually translating this secret world from something barely visible to the naked eye to vivid, colorful portraits is an exercise in patience. At sunset after a high tide, Minemizu and his team set up 30 color-rendering LED lights on tripods on the sea floor near the breeding grounds of migratory larval fish. He then waits for hours at a time while the lights attract the organisms and then depending on the size, uses either a macro or wide-angle lens to photograph them. The average size of the larvae is 1-4 centimeters, he estimates, with some as tiny as 2 millimeters."I am surprised by the new discoveries I encounter every time I dive," he wrote via email. "I am also amazed at how these tiny creatures are able to adapt to often challenging conditions. They look so frail yet they are able to develop the means to protect themselves from predators by becoming transparent, developing protective 'armour' such as banner-like fins. I admire their struggle to survive."Minezimu's hopes that his photographs will spark an interest in marine life, and the importance of protecting it. "I want to share these revelations about the beauty of our world under the sea with as many people as possible."You can see more of Ryo Minemizu's photographs on his website. The Secret World of Plankton will be on display at Foto Care until June 24, 2017.",
"All you need is Love Park in downtown Philadelphia. Officially John F. Kennedy Plaza, the fountain-centric space earned its nickname after Robert Indiana’s “Love” sculpture was installed here in 1976.Think of Detroit, Cleveland, and Cincinnati: resurgent, postindustrial American cities that are channeling creative forces to reinvent themselves for a new generation. Philadelphia is like this but better. It’s a scrappy underdog with a heart of gold and—who can resist the Rocky reference?—the eye of the tiger. Slowly but steadily Philly has changed from a city of industrial might in the first half of the past century to a city of ingenious makers. The evidence is everywhere.Lee Esposito is telling me about the first dinner his wife cooked for him: softball-size arancini, stuffed and deep-fried Italian rice balls. His gesturing hands move faster than his mouth. “They were like rubber,” he says. Then he adds sweetly, “But the conversation was good.”Nearly 40 years later, Lee and Mariella are still going strong. Wiry and energetic, she owns and runs Fante’s, a kitchen shop in South Philadelphia’s Italian Market, where she can also command the coffee counter when she needs to, frothing milk into a creamy blanket for cappuccinos. He cuts and chops and cajoles across the street as the patriarch of Esposito’s meat market.Esposito’s meat market opened in 1911 in South Philadelphia.Literary-themed Writer’s Block Rehab serves craft cocktails on Cypress Street.Amid the produce stalls that stretch down South Ninth Street, the Espositos have seen America’s oldest open-air market grow and diversify, welcoming new generations of immigrants from well beyond Italy’s borders. Today, stalwarts like Di Bruno Bros.’ cheese-and-salami utopia cede elbow room to up-and-comers like South Philly Barbacoa. A few blocks away, a Cambodian enclave offers savory noodles. “This has always been a market of immigrants. Just some of them look a little different now,” says Mariella, who arrived from Italy when she was 13.As a second-generation Italian American, I feel the pull of South Philly’s storied community. Amid Fante’s aisles of Italian kitchen essentials, I brush my fingertips across the ridges of the gnocchi makers and trace the lacework of gleaming pizzelle irons like my nonna used. Though the old-country traditions warm me, it’s the glimmer of new possibilities and the promise of reinvention that capture my attention and draw me closer.There’s a lot of glimmer in Philadelphia right now: vibrant murals and glinting metalworks, multihued mosaics and kaleidoscopic light installations, art collectives in garages, and—heaven help my nonna—a traditionally Italian neighborhood famous for cheesesteaks now sprouting vegan-punk-metal coffeehouses. I go in search of what makes Philly—one of Nat Geo Travel’s Best Trips for 2020—electric, eclectic, and entirely its own city.Isaiah Zagar’s Magic Gardens, on South Street, dazzle with mosiacs that cover every surface.Tucked into the classrooms of a once defunct vocational school that has been reborn as BOK—a collective of small businesses and art spaces—today’s titans of creativity are working on a tiny scale. By day, the hive of BOK’s studios mirrors in miniature the town whose reemergence is driven by its imaginative types.In the basement, recycled bottles become gorgeous glass things, a bicycle shop sells artisanal transport, and bacon gets hand-smoked. On the floors above, printmakers, photographers, architects, and bands such as The War on Drugs plan and produce, including a weaver making modern Mondrians out of scraps of wool. On the second floor, an artist named Ricardo at KLIP Collective uses light installations to paint the town in dancing and pulsing coats of color, even projecting a Christmas display onto the tower of City Hall.But he notes his work can’t be all flash and no substance. It has to be real; it has to have something to say. “You can’t fake it here,” he says admiringly of his hometown’s savvy. “You can’t fool these people.”By evening, the thrumming settles over the rooftops of South Philly as sunset’s hues deepen and drip into the folds of the city streets. BOK’s twin rooftop bars have a commanding view of neighborhood skylines: BOK Bar offers casual seating on colored cubes, Irwin’s incorporates the Day-Glo graffiti scribbled decades ago by BOK’s students.Downtown Philadelphia’s skyline shines with skyscrapers One Liberty Place, BNY Mellon Center, and the Comcast Center.On the 59th floor of the Comcast Center, Jean-Georges Philadelphia is the Four Seasons Hotel’s buzzy, signature restaurant.Philadelphia wears history like an embroidered cloak. It settles on the city’s shoulders at legendary squares like Rittenhouse, with its towering shade trees and gurgling fountain.But scratch the surface and you might find what Albanian-born fashion designer Bela Shehu describes as “fancy hooligans squatting in a space.” This is how she characterizes the pop-up design consortia called Private Schools that she organizes. “Doing something different has always been a thing here,” she says from her Rittenhouse Square atelier NinoBrand, where she makes chic clothing with cutting-edge silhouettes and urban energy. In the early 2000s, Shehu took advantage of the closing of department stores to carve out her creative space, sizing up and widening the cracks where ideas can flourish.If Shehu’s work is artful, peppering Philadelphia with signature style, then Isaiah Zagar’s is kaleidoscopic. For more than five decades, Zagar has been installing mosaics—made of everything from mirrors and Mexican crockery to old wine bottles and ceramic baby dolls—that glint and catch the sun along South Philly’s side streets. At his Magic Gardens, Zagar’s masterworks jam-pack the three-story-tall outdoor space, transporting the visitor to a place not entirely earthly.Murals have become Philly’s calling card—a clue and possibly a catalyst to the city’s inventive revival. Thirty-five years ago, Philadelphia Mural Arts founder Jane Golden started as a city servant on an anti-graffiti gig, repurposing graffiti artists as public art purveyors, putting color on canvases several stories high. “It’s the story of us, and it’s a story that’s unfolding,” says Golden. To date, there are more than 4,000 murals—including the only in situ Keith Haring in the United States—splashed and dabbed, pasted and wrapped around the city’s architecture, each composed with input from the neighborhood where it will reside so that it reflects the community where it blooms.A mural in South Philly’s East Passyunk neighborhood pays homage to beloved hometown crooners Frankie Avalon, Chubby Checker, and Bobby Rydell. Long a bastion of the city’s Italian-American community, East Passyunk is in transition, as new cafés and indie boutiques pop up.Extending into the Delaware River beside Ben Franklin Bridge, Race Street Pier looks toward New Jersey. The park’s terraced promenade is a favorite spot for jogging, dog walking, and yoga.“The act of creating has an extraordinary impact, not just on the people viewing artworks but on the people creating them,” says Golden. Some become conversations, she adds, letting communities say what they want or need. “There are requests for murals combating gun violence and giving voice to immigrant communities, murals around community identification and fear of gentrification. They want to say, This is who we are.”To turn any corner in Philly is to catch sight of Golden’s army’s handiwork. And sometimes of actual hands at work. (I myself helped dab pink polka dots onto a park’s community center alongside dozens of other volunteers on a sunny Thursday afternoon.) Some murals are colossal, including a September 2019 scene rising 18 stories high over the Schuylkill, calling to mind the chutzpah of artists and volunteers willing to balance on a scaffold all those floors up, paint can in one hand, brush in another. Most are 60 by 30 feet or more. Other times, they pop up in the warren of streets surrounding Walnut and Locust in the center of town, lanes so narrow they make passing buildings feel like the gentle brush of shoulders. It’s an intimate scale to take in street art.I have a soft spot for the tongue-in-cheek mural that swaddles the bar Dirty Franks, depicting namesakes from Sinatra to Aretha to Pope Francis to a frankfurter. It’s a fittingly saucy signature for a watering hole that local legend says kicked a young Bob Dylan off the stage for a lack of musicality.Ena Widjojo (center) sits with her family in the Indonesian restaurant, Hardena, she founded in East Passyunk.Born and raised in Albania, where she often made her own clothes, designer Bela Shehu first came to the U.S. on a student exchange program. She got her big break when a local boutique loved the homemade clothes she was wearing, and she's since launched her own fashion line, NinoBrand, headquartered at Rittenhouse Square.The orange-flamed neon sign at cheesesteak baron Geno’s is still lit, but food in America’s first capital city is being reinvented at a radical clip. Philly-born-and-bred owner Nicole Marquis of vegan Charlie Was a Sinner serves up meatless meatballs, and Grindcore House takes vegan coffee and pastries to another level, backgrounding them with blistering heavy metal music.At the other end of the volume meter, soft-pink rose petals levitate on chai foam at Suraya, a vegetarian-friendly Lebanese café and restaurant with an expansive patio that feels like it might have been plucked from a way station on the Silk Road and gently laid down in the heart of hip Fishtown.Indonesian hole-in-the-wall Hardena has some locals pondering leaving cheesesteaks behind forever. At the tiny South Philly restaurant—a 2019 James Beard Award upstart—lines weave out of the bright blue building, with diners waiting patiently for brilliantly colored curries, rich beef rendang, spicy peanut salads, and spongy yellow eggs sidling up to pillows of golden tofu delivered on polystyrene plates from an indoor food cart. A second outpost of Hardena now holds sway on Cherry Street Pier, an outdoor food oasis on the Delaware River, selling its sumptuous dishes from a converted street trolley.I meet the founders’ daughter Diana Widjojo as she puts the final touches on Philly’s first ever Indonesian Festival. It was her brainchild, and she called in every corner of Philadelphia’s Indonesian community to fill Cherry Street Pier with dance and music and the fragrant scents of galangal, lemongrass, and curry. In her lipstick-red sarong, Widjojo darts around the festival space. I ask her if Philly’s nascent passion for Indonesian food surprised her. To a degree, she admits. But her focus is on keeping up with demand, not scrutinizing it. “We used to refill the serving dishes two or three times a night. Now it’s six. I feel very bad when we run out of rendang,” she says of her aromatic, slow-cooked stew of beef, coconut milk, and ground spices. “People love rendang.”Opened in 2014, Spruce Street Harbor Park is a successful emblem of the revitalization of Philadelphia’s Delaware riverfront. At the free summertime park, locals come to swing in dozens of colorful hammocks.“What do you love about Philly?” I ask my taxi driver as we turn one of the corners of City Hall. Philadelphia’s heart and hub, City Hall radiates arteries to every quadrant of the city. His Philly elongations in full flare, the cabbie answers matter-of-factly, “I’ve lived here my whole life.” It seems like a nonanswer at first. But having recently decamped from Brooklyn for a pilgrimage around America, I know that home needs no explanation.Since 2011, cities have been growing faster than suburbs, according to a University of Pennsylvania study. With about 11,000 people per square mile, Philadelphia has the United States’ second highest population density, with millennials and immigrants largely to thank for its buzzing neighborhoods.Growth is not without its pains, but 2012 research by CityLab shows that the dense urban core of Philadelphia is increasing not just in sheer numbers but also in an ineffable and transcendent quality: happiness.Robert Indiana’s scarlet “Love” sculpture brightens an eponymous square so adored that in 2018 wedding ceremonies started being sanctioned there on Wednesdays. Opposite “Love” on the square, a 2019 sculpture consisting of simply “I Heart Philly” celebrates immigrants and draws a steady stream of Instagrammers in turbans, sarongs, candy-colored saris, and other accoutrements of their home countries. Equidistant between the two, I sit in a red rattan chair and watch a young boy delight in darting back and forth through a fountain’s jets. It’s a living city square, throbbing with activity, enticing visitors and locals alike to pause and become a part of the vibrant tableau. Presiding over it all is a statue of the city’s founder, William Penn, with his hand raised, as if perpetually poised to fondly ruffle all of Philadelphia’s collective hair.Long a city of makers that had fewer things to make after the U.S. began shifting in the 1960s from producing goods to providing services, Philly continues to blossom with countless clever and quirky impulses. Turn the corner of the alley behind Pat’s King of Steaks and you’ll be illuminated by a neon mural, “Electric Street.” A larger version, called “Electric Philly,” installed in fall 2019 in an underpass, connects Franklin Square to the warehouse district in the north.The artist who created both, David Guinn, says he is propelled by the chance to interact with the bones of the city. With his light installations, he wanted to make connections between neighborhoods, filling the empty or neglected spaces to tie the pieces of Philly together, letting the artwork carry viewers from one place to another. He feels that these opportunities are unique to this city. “There’s these other avenues that Philadelphia allows people to go down,” he says.Each month, 12 lucky couples can nab first-come, first-served time slots on “Wedding Wednesdays.” They pay $50 for a 30-minute ceremony in front of Philly’s iconic “Love” sculpture.A stroll down Passyunk (pronounced Pash-unk) Avenue—passing shops and restaurants and something called the Singing Fountain, which was once said to produce musical notes—is a lesson in Eclectic Philly 101. Like the Mad Hatter’s top hat, Philly Typewriter crowns East Passyunk. It’s the kind of anachronistic shop that makes you do a double take.“Most people are looking at things in here they’ve only heard about or seen in movies,” says owner Brian Kravitz, a man known to wear an Indiana Jones–style adventuring hat indoors and whose love of typewriters is infectious. “Tom Hanks has said they are a chick magnet,” he adds.As I walk the aisles, I’m charmed both by the machines—I’m a writer, after all—and the sweet jottings they’ve inspired. “Olivia was here,” one claims. “I am having so much fun,” reads another. Ditto.I’m tempted to type a paean to the charms of Philly, but I’m reminded of something Guinn said to me the day before: “I wouldn’t call it charming. It’s just trying to be itself.” Perhaps now that the city’s been liberated from the pressure to make what the world needs, Philadelphia has reignited its revolutionary spirit to make what Philly wants. And the world is watching.",
"At Cradle Mountain-Lake St. Clair National Park, hikers tackle multiday trails that pass through a landscape of ancient forests and alpine heaths.“Explore the possibilities” reads the license plate of my rental car, complete with a Tasmanian tiger peeking out from between two numbers. Challenge accepted, I think, tossing my hiking boots in the trunk and setting the GPS to the nearest national park.Once mocked as a backwater, Tasmania is now one of Australia’s fastest-growing tourism destinations and one of National Geographic’s Best Trips to take in 2020. Key to the appeal of Australia’s southernmost state is its raw natural beauty, which it owes largely to a combination of its remoteness (airport expansion plans are under way, but international flights are still a few years off) and the enduring green spirit of its half million or so residents.Swathed in 2,000-year-old trees and home to real-life devils (and even “tigers,” if you believe the rumors that the officially extinct thylacine lives on), it’s the stuff outdoor adventures are made of.In and around Hobart’s harbor cluster fishing boats, new luxury waterfront hotels such as the MACq01, and fish-and-chip shops.After making the trek here, visitors find that most of Tassie’s attractions are surprisingly accessible. It takes just four hours to drive the length of the state. No matter where you base yourself, opportunities to become immersed in nature are never far away—nearly half the state is designated national park, after all. Curious to discover if Tassie’s newest adventure experiences are as spectacular as they appear on my social media feeds, I headed to Hobart to explore the adrenalized enticements “within cooee” (within reach) of the capital.“Bit cuter than the tiger snake, isn’t it?” guide Joel Kovacs jokes, as a pademelon (like a mini-kangaroo) hops across our path along the Three Capes Track, pausing a few feet away to peer at us through a hedge of cutting grass once used by the Palawa (Aboriginal people of Tasmania) for basket-weaving. Along with the trio of Bennett’s wallabies and the deadly tiger snake that had joined us on the track, not to mention the echidna we spot later that day, it’s been a wildlife-watching boon.But the views remain the highlight of this four-day, 30-mile trail skirting the soaring dolerite cliffs that prop up the Tasman Peninsula, a windswept wilderness jutting off the state’s southeastern tip. Unveiled in 2015 to tremendous expectations, Tasmania’s newest multiday trail comes complete with architect-designed bunkhouses and a smattering of “story seats” inviting walkers to contemplate the history of the peninsula while taking a breather.Last year, Tasmanian Walking Company, which runs luxe guided hikes on some of Tassie’s top trails, launched the Three Capes Lodge Walk, with groups overnighting at private eco-sensitive cliffside lodges discreetly tucked off the main trail. Considering the gourmet meals, the local wine I don’t have to carry in myself, and the two guides’ knowledge, it’s a truly transformative way to experience the trail, which is unlike any other in Tassie. But the 880-odd tracks that lace the state’s national parks, reserves, and conservation areas each have their own unique aspects. And variety isn’t the only selling point.Related: This is what it’s like to see Australia’s Great Barrier Reef up close.“Even the trails with the best infrastructure don’t detract from the feeling of being immersed in the wilderness,” says Kovacs, a Hobart native who has tramped many of them in his decade of guiding. “Tassie’s trails haven’t been widened like you’ll see in New Zealand and elsewhere to accommodate big crowds, and I hope they’ll stay that way.” Kovacs’s favorite is the Overland Track, a six-day traverse of Cradle Mountain–Lake St. Clair National Park.High on my own wish list is the Wukalina Walk, a four-day Aboriginal-guided trek launched last year in the Bay of Fires, so-called partly for its orange lichen-covered granite boulders.Red-necked wallabies find a haven in Narawntapu National Park, a seaside reserve of wetlands, lagoons, and sand dunes on Tasmania’s northern coast.The island’s natural beauties include a superb fairy wren at the York Town Historic Site, the location of the first British settlement in Tasmania in the early 1800s.More casual walkers find a diversity of day hikes to choose from. I squeeze in a quick jaunt to Russell Falls (and Horseshoe Falls upstream), in Mount Field National Park, which tumbles through a rainforest setting immortalized on Tasmania’s first stamp collection designed to promote tourism in 1899.Other notable strolls include the Dove Lake Circuit beneath the towering spires of Cradle Mountain, Wineglass Bay Lookout for Freycinet National Park’s best view, and the Springlawn Nature Walk in Narawntapu National Park on the north coast for its wildlife. These are just three of 60 short walks listed by the Parks & Wildlife Service as the state’s best, and big developments are on the way.A proposal to build six eco-sensitive hiker’s huts along the South Coast Track—Tasmania’s most remote trail—was greenlighted last year, while this past July saw the announcement of plans to develop a walking route in the Tyndall Range on the edge of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.Peering over my handlebars at the steep, rocky single track jagging down between the snow gum trees, I wonder if I’ve overestimated my ability. But after navigating a few tight corners without falling off, I settle into the ride down Maydena Bike Park, allowing myself to steal longer glimpses of the ever changing landscape as we descend more than 2,600 feet through a web of 62 trails (and counting) threading down a hillside northwest of Hobart.The Bay of Fires, on the northeastern coast, got its name from the Aboriginal campfires spotted by British seafarers—but it could also apply to its orange lichen-covered boulders.“I like to think of this section as our own Jurassic Park,” assistant manager Luke Reed tells me as we weave between lofty king ferns in the temperate rainforest that hugs the slopes. Since decamping from the mainland two years ago when he got wind of the Maydena development, Reed says he hasn’t looked back. “There’s just so much to do here,” he says. “We’ve got Marriott’s Falls and Mount Field just down the road, and I still haven’t ridden all the trails in Maydena.”While Maydena is Tasmania’s only all-downhill bike park, it’s just one of a growing number of top mountain bike parks popping up around the state. Just north of Launceston, Hollybank Mountain Bike Park opened in 2014 with a six-mile descent called the Juggernaut that draws riders from around the world.The following year, the former tin-mining town of Derby transformed into Australia’s premier mountain biking destination overnight following the opening of Blue Derby Mountain Bike Trails. And the scene continues to evolve, with the first section of the St. Helens Mountain Bike Trail Network, 40 miles southeast of Derby, having opened in November.“You can even ride some of the Mount Wellington trails,” says Reed, as we peel off our helmets. Relieved to have completed a lap of Maydena without having to test the limits of my travel insurance, I take his word for it.My guide, Liam Weaver, sees it first. Following his lead, I kayak slowly toward the small brown lump moving across the water. Suddenly it stops, its slick furry body and iconic “duck bill” more visible as it pauses on the surface for a few seconds before diving under the tannin-stained water. It’s my first wild platypus sighting, and I’m rapt.“On some trips we spot more than 20,” says Weaver, grinning back at me, and I snap back to scanning the river for more platypus activity.Opened in 2015, wilderness retreat Pumphouse Point frames a wintry scene at Lake St. Clair. The glacier-carved basin is Australia’s deepest freshwater lake.Fog rolls in over the fertile Tamar River valley, home to several wineries.One of Australia’s most elusive creatures, these shy monotremes (egg-laying mammals) thrive in the upper Derwent River, which snakes down a rural valley northwest of Hobart lined with sheep farms and hop plantations that scent the air with an odd mix of lanolin and beer. Weaver estimates 30 to 50 breeding pairs of platypuses make their homes here, setting the scene for Tassie Bound’s flagship kayaking tour.“When Liam first took me down here on a kayak, it felt like we were being gifted an opportunity to create a unique, sustainable tourism experience,” Liam’s wife and business partner, Fiona, tells me after the tour. She also runs Wild Island Women, Tasmania’s first female adventure community. “Even some locals are unaware that we have this incredible wildlife-spotting opportunity on our doorstep,” she says.Even if you don’t see any platypuses, it’s a ridiculously scenic afternoon paddle downriver. Three years since launching the tour, Tassie Bound remains the only operator on the river, which adds to the sense of adventure. The couple also run various other kayaking tours, and there’s some beautiful kayaking to be had around the Freycinet Peninsula, though keen paddlers in search of the ultimate off-grid adventure would be wise to check out Roaring 40s Kayaking’s multiday expeditions in the rugged, hidden waterways of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.Operated in the same region is Australia’s most spectacular white-water rafting experience, an eight-day adventure down the Franklin River, which was saved from a dam project in the ’70s, thanks to one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australia’s history.“The experience of paddling down the untamed wilderness of the Franklin, which has no man-made infrastructure whatsoever, is incredibly powerful,” says Tassie-born Elias Eichler, who runs Franklin River Rafting with his wife and fellow rafting guide, Franzi. “The water is so pure we have a cup hanging off the side of the boat that you can just dunk in the river if you get thirsty. Where else can you do that these days?”From King Island Dairy cheeses to Bruny Island oysters, Tasmania’s edible output is legendary, and with more than half a dozen established food and drink trails across the state, choosing your own culinary itinerary is one of Tassie’s most rewarding soft adventures.Given its ideal climate for malting, Tassie’s Whisky Trail is a good place to start. Following a suitably weird morning at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), Tassie’s flagship cultural institution and an adventure in itself, I drop into Shene Estate, just a 30-minute drive north of Hobart. The Kernke family has painstakingly restored an exquisite 19th-century Gothic-Revival sandstone stables and barn, the latter now acting as the tasting room of the family distillery.The first release of their triple-distilled Mackey whisky won the gold medal at the 2018 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, but I’m partial to their Poltergeist gin. It was named in honor of the pagan witch-protection symbols etched into the buildings during colonial times, though Anne Kernke, who runs tours and tastings by appointment, hints there’s more to the story. She once experienced the sensation of someone sitting on her bed when she was in it, and nobody else was around. “We love a property with spirit, so we thought we had better make some,” she winks as she pours me a gin and tonic.Other paths reveal the spectrum of Tasmania’s tastes. Oenophiles follow the blue-and-yellow signs along the 105-mile loop north from Launceston to discover more than 30 cellar doors on the Tamar Valley Wine Route. The Made on Bruny Island gourmet trail is ideal for oyster and cheese lovers.While tucking into a perfectly battered fillet of trevalla from one of Hobart’s famous floating fish-and-chip shops, I think that if there’s a downside to seeking adventure in Tasmania, it’s that no matter how hard you throw yourself into it, you’ll be lucky to go home any lighter.Taking another bite, I figure I can live with that.",
"Raja Ampat, Indonesia, is a diver’s dream, with whales, sharks, and schools of fish, such as yellowstripe scad.Women & Adventure: National Geographic is celebrating women around the world who fearlessly push boundaries in science, photography, exploration, and beyond. Scroll down for a trio of tales from female adventurers who love the sea—and what they learned from venturing into its blue expanses. Then check out these three adventures by land.“It’s an underwater photographer’s dreamscape,” says diver Tanya Burnett of Raja Ampat, Indonesia. “The reefs just explode with color and life. It’s almost overwhelming for some.”Traditional-style Indonesian schooners take divers to this tranquil archipelago of more than 1,500 islets to see one of the world’s greatest collections of marine biodiversity. Huge shrimp preside over the reef, their antennae reaching out in all directions. A school of surgeonfish moves like a cloud until a shark plows through, sending them scattering like wisps of smoke. At times there are so many fish you can barely see through the water.Each dive serves up new wonders: a manta swooping overhead, a solitary dolphin rolling around playfully on a reef, giant schools of snapper and fusiliers whirling around us like tornadoes, venomous sea kraits wafting through sunlit water.At Banda Neira, in the Spice Islands, once rare nutmeg trees dot a verdant idyll that lured Dutch traders in the 1600s. Now, locals sell the spices in fragrant markets.Among the great delights of diving is never knowing what will appear. One day it might be an swirl of yellowstripe scad, the next it might be melon-headed whales. Some places can surpass even the greatest expectations.Lesson learned: You can’t control the sea but you can immerse yourself and respect the unexpected. —Kate SiberBuffering Sweden’s capital from the Baltic Sea, the islands of the Stockholm archipelago—called the skärgården—are a wonderland of rocks, skerries, and islets with pine forests, fields of wildflowers, and bare granite. The exact number of islands is debatable, but the general consensus is about 30,000.The archipelago stretches from downtown Stockholm and brings wilderness into the city. Although regular ferry services visit most of the larger islands, you can experience these glacier-carved isles by kayak.Exposure to nature is a central part of life in Sweden, where the country’s constitution guarantees allemansrätten (“everyman’s right”), a freedom to roam in natural spaces. Aside from the requirement not to disturb or destroy, people can forage, catch fish, swim in lakes, visit beaches, set up a tent, and access any land as long as they stay out of private gardens and maintain the stipulated 70 meters (229 feet) from a dwelling.The vast archipelago is ideal for exploration by kayak because one can linger among the quiet coves and passages.Archipelagoes stretch the length of Sweden’s coastline, perfect for kayakers both novice and experienced.Only 40 minutes by ferry from the mainland, Utö provides a quick transition to island time. Once an active mining community with some of the oldest iron mines in the country, the island of about 250 people and only a few cars is known today for its beaches, restaurants, and the famed Utö dark rye bread that tastes of molasses and anise.A watery obstacle course, the bay is scattered with skerries, or rocky isles. Far out in the southern part of the archipelago, Utö isn’t protected on its south shore, and kayakers may encounter choppy seas as they paddle toward the island’s northern tip.On Huvudskär, one of the archipelago’s final outposts, heather, cotton grass, and crowberry grow in rock crevices. A lighthouse rises over small red cottages. There have been fishermen and hunters here for more than 700 years, but there are no longer any permanent residents on this remote rock slab. The water out here is deep blue and it feels as if there are no boundaries.Lesson learned: With a bit of bravado, you can learn a new skill and see the world from a different perspective. —Jill K. RobinsonWhile most guests at the Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort off the coast of Queensland, Australia, are pouring their first cup of coffee, a few are donning wet suits and grabbing masks, fins, and snorkels, then walking 10 minutes to the far side of the island for a sunrise swim.Peter Gash, the island’s tireless steward, is the instigator of this early-morning meditation that starts with a shock of cold as swimmers ease into the pink-tinted waters. Floating facedown above corals that form the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Gash points out underwater wonders: clown fish, moon wrasse, parrotfish, painted flutemouth, angelfish, white-banded triggerfish. A reef shark may coast by, or a sea turtle pop its head up before dipping back down to find an outcropping of coral on which to scratch its shell. The crystalline water is a miracle in itself.It wasn’t always this way. The 1,400-mile-long Great Barrier Reef is often a narrative of devastating coral bleaching, heralding its imminent death.Lady Elliot Island itself, named in 1816 by Captain Thomas Stuart aboard the ship of the same name, was a guano-rich island mined for a decade in the 1800s, its fish and turtles depleted. Around 1873, stripped of resources, the island was abandoned to the sun and shifting winds. In 1969 Australian aviator Don Adams built an airstrip and accommodations, started replanting the island, and over time created a no-frills resort. The torch was taken up by fellow Australian pilot Gash, who brought solar power, desalination, and composting to the island. He firmly established the remote resort—now 40-plus cottages and glamping tents, many of which open directly onto the white-sand beach—as a leader in sustainable tourism, a model for other resorts along the Great Barrier Reef.Lady Elliot Island is especially known for manta rays and participates in Project Manta, a research program based at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. Researchers have used the island as a home base for studying the mantas’ migration, behavior, and health.The island and its surrounding reef system prove that the story of the Great Barrier Reef doesn’t need to have a tragic ending. When people fall in love with a place and make a conscious effort to protect it, we glimpse a sustainable future where we can all keep dipping our heads underwater to experience awe.Lesson learned: Once you know what climate change looks like, it’s easier to visualize solutions. —Anne Farrar",
"Women & Adventure: National Geographic is celebrating women around the world who fearlessly push boundaries in science, photography, exploration, and beyond. Here is a trio of tales from female adventurers who explore all ends of the earth—and what they learned along the way. Then check out these three adventures by sea.I’d been warned not to travel to China’s northwest Xinjiang Province. According to China’s state-run press, it was far too dangerous for foreigners, due to unrest. Despite warnings, I had no other way to continue by rail from mainland China through Kazakhstan and Russia, partly along the old Silk Route, then eventually back to my home in London. And I was determined not to let anything stop me.Within hours of my arrival in the city of Turfan, I found the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uygur community gentle and welcoming, inviting me into their family-run cafés to try bone broth that glistened, fat chewy noodles, and mutton skewers cooked on sidewalk grills. Chinese soldiers roamed the streets. From the closed-circuit cameras placed on mosques and the enforced restriction on beards and headscarves to the patrolling tanks, a feeling of unease permeated the city.Saddened to leave Turfan, I boarded the new high-speed service to Urumqi, which connects the two cities in just over an hour, and found a distinct absence on board of Uygur passengers, most of whom were forbidden from traveling freely within the region.Finding an empty table, I sat down just as a Buddhist nun with a shaved head ran up to me, laughing. Flummoxed, I strained to catch a few words from her stream of chatter and eventually extracted “Indian.” A fellow passenger translated, explaining that she was curious as to whether or not I was Indian, and I confirmed that I was indeed of Indian ethnicity. Thrilled, the nun clapped, slapped her thighs, and sat down, swinging her feet like a child. I learned that the nun was excited to meet someone of my origin, as India had come to the rescue of the Dalai Lama and she was grateful. The nun had fled Tibet, and unable ever to return, she had made her home near Urumqi.Joyfully, the nun pored over my photos from the Potala Palace in Lhasa, scrolling through each one with concentration before realizing her stop was approaching. Pulling out a gold iPhone, she gestured for me to add her as a contact on WeChat, the multipurpose, ubiquitous Chinese messaging app.Unsure what to do, I handed over my phone and she showed me how to scan her QR code. As the train slowed into the station, she tied a thin red string around my wrist, wrapped herself in robes, and picked up her bag, waving as she jumped down the steps. When the train began to roll away from the platform, I felt a vibration in my hand and looked down to see a message from the nun: a GIF of a laughing Buddha exploding in light.Lesson learned: Political divisions you read about in the news don’t define your interactions with people on the ground. —Monisha Rajesh“I bought a bike and started cycling” was the response veteran Irish traveler Dervla Murphy gave when she was asked how she planned her odyssey across India that would become the beloved travelogue Full Tilt: Ireland to India With a Bicycle. It’s proof that adventure can start with a simple push of the pedal.Ghent, in the northern Flemish region of Belgium, may not be India, but it has a long love affair with the bike. The city has the largest pedestrian zone in Europe, with more than 120 hectares of car-free space to roam. Sandwiched between the capital, Brussels, and the fairytale city of Bruges, Ghent delights in being the underdog, but the city is far from being the ugly duckling of the trio. French novelist Victor Hugo described Ghent as “a kind of Venice of the North,” thanks to the pretty, medieval twist of streets that cluster around swan-patrolled canals.Ghent isn’t sleepy in the least though. For 10 days in July, close to two million people turn up to enjoy a riot of free concerts and street theater known as the Gentse Feesten. And the green credentials extend further, too. Ghent is dubbed a vegetarian capital, and every Thursday is a meat-free day with restaurants and cafés dishing up veggie options for all.Ghent is a city to be explored with legs and stomach. So after dipping into Sint-Baafskathedraal to see the famous 15th-century polyptych Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, bump across the cobblestones and turn down onto Graslei quay. The city’s first commercial port, it’s lined with ancient guild houses and students cooling their ankles in the water. Then it’s on to Groentenmarkt, home to Tierenteyn-Verlent, a 229-year-old delicatessen known for its homemade mustard doled out of wooden barrels, and stalls selling cuberdons—local cone-shaped purple candy also known as neuzekes (little noses).Dreupelkot is a slip of a café serving shots of jenever (a gin-like liquor made from malt wine) in flavors ranging from garlic to grapefruit. Patershol was once a working-class district, home to brothels and dingy drinking dens; it was gentrified in the ’80s and now conceals some of the most exciting (and exclusive) restaurants in the city.End the day at local bar ‘t Velootje, with its wacky decor so crammed with old bikes you can barely get in the door. Bearded owner Lieven de Vos has run this cherished spot for more than a quarter of a century.Biking trumps other modes of transport because you don’t just see the city, you feel it. The cobblestones judder your bones, the wind streaks your hair, scents surround you, and then you can park right in front of your destination.Lesson learned: Travel doesn’t have to be difficult. Take a spin wherever you are and let the day unfold. —Emma ThomsonPalomino, Colombia, is the type of place where soul-searching European expats with dreadlocks come to find their tribe. It’s the type of place I tend to avoid. On our way into town, our taxi driver tells us it used to be quiet around here, a home for indigenous people, but in the last few years travelers came flocking for the beachy vibe and nearby Sierra Nevada range. Developers came next, bringing yoga studios, vegan restaurants, and juice bars.After checking into our hotel, we head straight to the beach and spread out on the sand. Sean buys roasted nuts in an oil-stained brown paper bag from an elderly man. There are vendors everywhere. They sell arepas, fresh fruit, woven bags, and those patterned friendship bracelets seemingly everyone brings home from trips. A dark-skinned woman walks by holding up a binder full of images of Kim Kardashian wearing “Bo Derek” and “boxer” braids, claiming she can replicate the look for “50 mil pesos.”A few feet away I see a woman squeezing oil from what looks like an old bottle of dishwashing liquid onto a man’s sunburned shoulders. She’s crouched down on a small stool and her firm brown hands are working on his back, kneading and slapping and pounding.She notices me watching and shouts, “You next, mami!”When she’s done with the guy, she makes her way over to me. We introduce ourselves. Brenda nods toward the image of a dark-skinned black woman with a big, juicy afro that’s printed on my tote bag. She peels back her sun hat to reveal a puff of thick coily hair and gives me a thumbs up.I knew we—Black people—were here in Colombia, and I’d been hoping that somewhere along this journey I’d have a moment for this type of fellowship. So often when I’m traveling, my hair, skin, and body are what set me apart. When I can connect my diasporic dots in the midst of it, I feel a strengthened sense of self; no matter where I am in the world, I’m at home.Brenda proceeds to bend, crack, and snap my body into alignment. We’re mostly quiet throughout, but when I flip onto my stomach, she taps my butt playfully and laughs “mismo, mismo!” same, same! And we start cackling all over again. She repeats this word when massaging my scalp, her hands deep in my afro. “Mismo,” she says, and then, “linda,” beautiful. She whispers it over and over, “linda, linda, linda.”When she’s finished, I pass Brenda 50 mil, plus 20 more in respect for her hustle. She tucks the rolled-up bills into her bra.We sit together for a while. My Spanish isn’t great and neither is her English, but we make do. I learn she’s actually from Venezuela but left six months ago to earn money to send back to her children, who stayed behind. Brenda is one of more than four million Venezuelans who’ve had to flee due to the country’s ongoing political and economic crisis; food is scarce, the dollar is hyperinflated, and death tolls are rising.“Colombia es beautiful, pero Venezuela … ” Brenda sighs. “Venezuela es … sweet,” she says, kissing her fingers to her lips. I look at her, thinking this town might be a little strange for the both of us, but in this moment we’ve found a sweet familiarity in each other. Sean and I had set off to Colombia in search of thrills, but, as I’m constantly reminded on each of my journeys, adventures don’t have to be about adrenaline and increased heart rate. They can be about the bravery it takes to reach across cultural divides and find commonalities.Brenda pulls a small Nokia from her fanny pack; the screen is slicked with massage oil. “Mi hija,” she says, pointing to a photo of a smiling brown girl on the home screen.“Linda,” I say. “Que linda.”Lesson learned: Not speaking the local language is not a barrier to making meaningful connections. —Glynn Pogue",
"At 12,139 feet above sea level, Potala is the highest palace in the world. The 1,300-year-old structure was originally built as a gesture of love, commissioned by Tibetan king Songtsen Gambo for his marriage to Princess Wencheng of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. Eventually monks came to rule Tibet and the palace was expanded and converted into the winter residence for the Dalai Lama. But when the Dalai Lama was exiled to India in 1959, the Chinese government took over and made the grounds into a museum.Still, the Potala Palace remains an iconic part of the region and a mecca for Buddhists around the world. The name Potala is a nod to a sacred mountain in India, where the Buddha of compassion is said to dwell. Year-round, thousands of religious pilgrims circle the perimeter of the palace with prayer wheels and beads to ask for blessing. Many have traveled thousands of miles by foot just to pay their respects.Stretching more than 5,000 miles, the Great Wall of China was built by first emperor, Qin, who began construction in the 3rd century B.C.With more than a thousand rooms, 10,000 painted scrolls, 698 murals, and thousands of exquisite statues made from precious alloys and jewels, the structure has become one of the most famous spiritual sanctums in the world. Inside are the tombs of eight Dalai Lamas, hundreds of sacred Buddhist scrolls, and numerous shrines. Butter lamps light the hallways and watchful monks are stationed in nearly every public room to ensure that decorum is maintained.The building is divided into two sections—the Red Palace and the White Palace. The former serves as the religious section and the latter as the administrative area. They are literally colored red and white; a fresh coat of paint made up of milk, honey, and sugar is applied every autumn.The Potala Palace was named a World Heritage site in 1994 by UNESCO, and the neighboring Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka and were added on as extensions in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Jokhang Temple is considered the most sacred temple in Tibet and the Norbulingka was the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama. All three structures are outstanding embodiments of Tibetan culture and despite waves of natural and human-induced damage, they are international icons that have remained spiritually relevant and intact over the centuries.Fly into the Lhasa Gonggar Airport or take a train into the city. Visitors must obtain a Tibet Tourism Bureau permit through a local tour agency in advance (allow up to 14 days) to enter Tibet by plane or train.All visitors must visit the Potala Palace with a tour group. Groups are allocated an hour inside the premises and photos are not allowed. While the palace and its adjacent temples are very much tourist attractions, many of the guests are Tibetan pilgrims who have come to the sacred sites to pray.As one of the highest cities in the world, Lhasa can get quite frosty during the winter. Summer is the best time to visit. June to August is peak tourist season.",
"Take it from a traveler who knows: “Trust leads to happy days and happy lives.” That’s what the Dalai Lama told me when I asked him how seeing the world can lead to peace. Short answer: Travel teaches us to trust.Strapping on a backpack as a 20-year-old, I didn’t need to search for happiness; the very act of setting out on a distant journey was bliss. As the years stacked up, the happiness of engagement with other cultures became a deeper quest. My travels led to Bhutan, drawn by that nation’s policies to encourage happiness.Visitors to the kingdom get to savor some of the results: With more than half of the country protected in national parks and reserves, trekking through Bhutan’s meadows and majestic old-growth forests, home to rare species such as black-necked cranes and greater one-horned rhinos, will bring a lasting smile to any passionate traveler.Bhutan’s happiness checklist ranges from protecting the environment to promoting traditional heritage. Yet a national survey classified less than 50 percent of the population as happy. Even in the so-called land of happiness, being happy can prove elusive. Could it be that the clearest path to happiness is not through policy, but something more direct?Costumed dancers celebrate Domkhar Tshechu, a festival in Bhutan.“For a happy life, physical well-being is important, but true wellness must include a happy mind,” the Dalai Lama told me. He advised that when we focus too much on problems “we can make it worse” and if we always think about what is wrong, “it appears unbearable.” By maintaining a wider perspective, “we create a lot of room to keep hope and enthusiasm.” To me, this insight means that traveling really can make the world a happier place because it forces us to trust one another.So strike out on that journey, experience cultures, and stay true to compassion. “For real happiness, a warm heart is more important than a brilliant mind. Remember that your best, most reliable friend is your own intelligence and your own warmheartedness. Let this be your guide to a happy life.”",
"Stretching more than 5,000 miles, the Great Wall of China was built by first emperor, Qin, who began construction in the 3rd century B.C.China boasts more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other country, except Italy. Honored for their “cultural and natural heritage of outstanding value to humanity,” these 50 diverse sites include palaces perched on mountaintops, giant panda sanctuaries, and traditional villages that transport back in time.The most celebrated places like the Great Wall of China or Emperor Qin's terra-cotta warriors need no introduction. Yet the immense nation of China offers an incredible wealth of World Heritage Sites, just begging to be explored.",
"Sunrise warms the Picos de Europa, part of the Cordillera Cantabrica range that secludes Asturias from the rest of Spain.This is a meal I could eat nowhere else, it occurs to me around the seventh course. I’m in the mountains of Asturias, one of Nat Geo’s Best Trips for 2020, and I’ve been served a dish of sea urchin and ham that unites the coast and peaks of this northern Spanish province in a single bite. Two tables away, I see José Antelo raise his fork in triumph.Antelo works as an air traffic controller in Barcelona. His brother, Luis, is a superior court judge in Madrid. They live in two of Europe’s top restaurant cities; they can enjoy memorable meals night after night without ever boarding a plane. But three or four times a year, they meet to eat in Asturias.Asturias? This autonomous region of Spain lying along the Bay of Biscay, dense with trees that run up hillsides, dotted by wild marshland, and scalloped with tidy beaches, isn’t located between Madrid and Barcelona. It’s hundreds of miles from either. When I mention that, José laughs. “I’m sure you know why we come,” he says. “Nowhere else in Spain can you find so many flavors, such incredible variety, in such a small area. It is like an entire country.”The coastal region’s rich seafood tops menus at acclaimed restaurants such as Güeyu Mar, in Ribadesella.In the village of Arriondas, lavender scents the garden at Michelin-starred Casa Marcial, headed by chef Nacho Manzano, who grew up in the now renovated farmhouse.We’re dining at Casa Marcial. Housed in an old mansion, or casona, decorated with window boxes and topped by a barrel-tiled roof, the restaurant sits at the top of a winding road in La Salgar, a mountain village that smells of pine. The coast is six miles to the north, as the Asturian wood pigeon flies. But La Salgar remains so deeply embedded in the hilly, heavily forested interior of the region that, I’m told, many of its residents spend their entire childhoods without ever seeing the water.The Manzano family opened Casa Marcial in the middle of the last century as a general store, selling olive oil, cider, cattle feed, even clothing. In 1993, 22-year-old Nacho Manzano, the son of the owners, returned from the coast to start a restaurant. Gastronomes such as the Antelos love Casa Marcial, which has been awarded two Michelin stars. So do locals, who don’t dress up to eat there. But nobody more admires its modern Asturian cuisine—fresh, briny seafood such as razor clams, but also the thick bean stews of the mountain villages so pure and perfectly rendered—than other chefs.On this November night, half a dozen chefs from across Spain have gathered to celebrate the restaurant’s 25th anniversary. They aren’t just paying homage; they are actually cooking for Nacho and about 50 of us diners. We eat plate after plate of food: more ham, roasted rabbit from the hills around the restaurant, and the salty, rubbery sea cucumbers that I’ve only had along the Spanish coast. By the time I head back over the mountain to my hotel in seaside Gijón, we’re nearly five hours into tomorrow.Related: Check out these gorgeous photos of Spain.Walking in the drizzle by the seawall where on summer days surfers congregate, I pass a rowboat filled with predawn fishermen. When I look around at where I am, and remember the mountain village I just left, José Antelo’s description hits home. Asturias is like an entire country.Evenings find locals socializing around Gijón’s old port, a gathering place since the 1500s for fishermen, sailors, and merchants. One of Spain’s most important port cities thanks to deep waters and a sheltered harbor, Gijón continues to update its facilities to attract cargo and cruise ships. A popular pastime is sipping prized local sidra (cider), poured the Asturian way—from up high into a glass, intended to create froth and open up flavors.Returning to the region for the first time in years, I’d driven north from Madrid a few days before. By the time I hit the A-66 highway, the mesa around me had been flat and brown for hours. At the northern edge of the province of León, I entered the Negrón tunnel—and emerged somewhere else, a land all its own. The highway curved through a valley rimmed with tall pines, past bulbous rock formations atop vertiginous slopes. I saw homes with picture windows cantilevered over stone-paved streets and ancient granaries perched on stilts. At times what I was seeing looked more like Ireland than Spain. There had been no official sign of demarcation when I passed from León to Asturias. It didn’t matter. I hadn’t needed one.I was heading for the Asturian capital of Oviedo, a compact city of roughly 220,000 residents separated from the slightly larger Gijón by rapidly encroaching suburbs. Each city has a proprietary social scene; you can be a VIP in one and all but unknown in the other. Oviedo has the better museums; Gijón has the beach. Twice a year, the Sporting Gijón and Real Oviedo soccer teams bring the rivalry to life before a full stadium.Most visitors come upon Oviedo first. They seek out some of the best pre-Romanesque architecture in the world, 14 preserved buildings, including the tall, narrow ninth-century palace-church complex of Santa María del Naranco. I make a pilgrimage there as soon as I arrive. I enter a vaulted room made of stones the color of milk-clouded coffee. Only one other person is here. The windows are cut thick into the walls of the building, their shutters flung open to the breeze. I peer over a grove of trees and see the city spread out below.Within the hour I’m making my way through Oviedo and find sculptures, it seems, on almost every corner; more than a hundred adorn the capital. Before I reach my hotel, I pass “La Maternidad,” a rounded woman with an equally rounded child by Colombian sculptor Fernando Botero, then Miguel Ortiz Berrocal’s “El Diestro,” a metallic rendering of a bullfighter’s torso. Later, in a residential neighborhood, I’ll discover a conference center and office building designed by Santiago Calatrava that looks like a massive winged creature about to take flight. The next day, I’ll be transfixed by “El Regreso de Williams B. Arrensberg,” a statue of a trench-coated friend of artist Eduardo Úrculo, surrounded by suitcases and sporting a bemused expression as he gazes at the city’s cathedral.The medieval town of Llanes is one of the top summer destinations in Asturias.Oviedo’s artistic awakening has happened only over the last generation, just as Nacho Manzano started drawing international attention to his small restaurant in the mountains. The timing is no coincidence. “Before then, we didn’t think Asturias had much to offer the world,” explains Esther Manzano, Nacho’s sister, who has her own restaurant, La Salgar, in the center of Gijón. “We didn’t believe in ourselves. We didn’t have fantastic weather. We were very hard to get to—a long drive from anywhere, there were no flights. We just assumed nobody would want to come.”Then two things happened: Europe’s new bargain airlines began flying intrepid tourists here in the late 1990s; and Woody Allen’s 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona sent its characters to Oviedo for a weekend, causing filmgoers around the world to turn to each other in surprise. Why would anyone leave Barcelona to visit … Asturias? “Woody Allen told the world we exist,” Esther says. “He opened the world’s eyes, but he also opened our eyes.” A statue of the controversial writer-director stands off Calle Uria.Explore more: Here’s a quick guide to Málaga, Spain’s sixth largest city.Tourism has helped raise the standard of living in Asturias, giving restaurants like those run by Nacho and Esther Manzano a way to thrive. But it hasn’t changed the nature of the place. Spain entertained more than 80 million visitors last year, enough to overrun many of its best known places. Barcelona has become a set piece, far from the raucous port town it used to be. Madrid seems like an international shopping mall.Asturias, however, remains regional, strong flavored, authentic. Menus in English are hard to find in Oviedo, and until recently they were all but absent elsewhere in the region. José Andrés—the Asturian-born, Washington, D.C.-based chef who has become a global sensation—wants to open a restaurant not far from where he lived as a child. If he does, I’m betting it won’t have an English menu either.Asturias’s two largest cities are polar opposites. Oviedo, like many inland cities, tends to be insular, conservative, overtly polite, and socially inaccessible. Gijón is a port town, working-class and occasionally profane, but open to the sea and new ideas. Oviedo has an opera house and a full program to fill it. Gijón prefers its series of avant-garde festivals. I’m pleased that one of those festivals, Jazz Xixón, is under way at the Teatro Jovellanos when I arrive. I buy a ticket to see the Portico Quartet, an experimental band that was nominated for Britain’s Mercury Prize; other headliners will include the playful Spanish group El Viaje del Swing (The Journey of Swing). It’s easy to spot the blazing neon sign for Teatro Jovellanos, mounted high above the pedestrian mall of Paseo Begoña. Inaugurated in 1899, the theater was renovated shortly after the fall of ruler Francisco Franco in 1975 and bought by Gijón in 1995. It has served as a cultural centerpiece since.I find Tonio Criado, the festival’s director, standing in the lobby underneath an enormous crystal chandelier. Criado grew up in a small inland town near Cangas de Onís before moving to Gijón. Now he wouldn’t live anywhere else.“It’s the youngest city in the region, and the freshest,” he says. “You find that in our music, our cuisine, and our way of life.” When I ask him whether he feels more Spanish or Asturian, he doesn’t hesitate. “Oh, Asturian,” he says. “But really, I am from Gijón. What we are doing here couldn’t happen in Oviedo.”Asturias calls itself the país de quesos (land of cheese) due to the dozens of artisanal varieties it produces, including origin-protected Cabrales. Farmers Javier Diaz Bada and Nicolas Bada Herrero tend goats whose milk contributes to the region’s famous cheese.The following morning I visit the Museum of the Asturian People, which sits just east of downtown Gijón. It sounds like a Cold War tourist attraction in an Eastern-bloc capital, but actually it’s a re-creation of a traditional Asturian village. The grounds include a 17th-century peasant house, a covered alley where the recreational bowling game called cuatreada is played, a bagpipe museum (bagpipes are a common musical instrument in Asturias and Galicia), and several of the granaries—called hórreos—that are ubiquitous in the area. Inside the exhibition space, the topic of the day is food. I am astonished to see how rudimentary the kitchens were, even in urban areas, into the 1950s and 1960s.Many of the dishes made in those kitchens are now served at Esther Manzano’s restaurant, La Salgar, named after the Manzanos’ hometown. A modern glass box attached to the museum, the restaurant isn’t officially affiliated with it, but their missions are aligned. If Casa Marcial is where the Manzano family adds an Asturian element to high gastronomy, La Salgar rewards Asturians with deliciously familiar food amid Gijón’s clamor. The idea was to have local diners taste quintessential versions of dishes they’ve been eating all their lives, such as arroz con pitu, a version of chicken, rice, and red pepper that every Asturian remembers from childhood. “Dishes of the home,” Esther declares, “served in a restaurant.”Like San Francisco and Scotland, bad weather suits Asturias. I leave Gijón and head east along the coast under a steady drizzle. In August, Ribadesella attracts Spaniards who are desperate for a respite from oppressive heat. In November, with rain misting a cool morning, it becomes a particularly lovely local fishing village. Kids splash through puddles in the streets. Adults walk dogs. Shop owners stand in the doorways greeting friends.Fashioned with locally mined pink limestone, the Basilica de Santa María la Real de Covadonga rises near the Holy Cave and its Virgin of Covadonga.Built in the 9th century as a royal palace, Santa Maria del Naranco, in Oviedo, became a church in later years. In 1985, UNESCO designated the pre-Romanesque-style building a World Heritage site.Not far away is the Tito Bustillo Cave, site of one of the more remarkable discoveries of the last century. In 1968 a group of amateur spelunkers realized that falling rocks many centuries before had sealed an opening of a cave. They returned with full gear and managed to make their way inside. When they did, they were surprised to discover that one cave opened onto another, and then another. On the walls, they found a magnificent series of cave drawings, dating back more than 10,000 years. Another mysterious drawing was made some 30,000 years ago, according to carbon dating.Although the site has been validated by waves of experts, its existence continues to raise more questions than have been answered. Why, I find myself wondering, were drawings made in precisely the same place some 20,000 years apart?I ponder that over lunch 15 minutes to the north, on a spit of beach. Güeyu Mar restaurant is a glorified shack marked by a huge plastic kingfish mounted over the doorway. Abel Alvarez, chef and owner, has been grilling fish here since 2007.His menu consists of whatever the boats have brought in that day, supplemented by seafood in metal tins that Alvarez has preserved himself. There’s no meat of any kind, nor rice or potatoes, just seafood and local vegetables and excellent bread rolls. I eat razor clams and sardines, then grilled cockles and kingfish. I drink Asturian wine, which barely existed a decade ago, from the inland winery Dominio del Urogallo, the best of the few producers clustered on the western side of the province. The blend of three local red grape varieties has the stony freshness that I usually associate with cool-climate whites. Crisp and salty, it tastes like the sea.Rain is falling again; when I step outside I see a vivid rainbow arcing from the trees atop the steep hills down to the water. Then I pivot inland. I stop in the hill town of Cangas de Onís, where a much photographed Roman bridge spans an unhurried stream.From there the next morning, it’s a short trip to Covadonga, which is one of the most historic spots in Spain. You could make the argument that modern Spain began when the advance of the Moors was halted here by the Visigoth nobleman Pelagius, the founder of the Kingdom of Asturias, in 718.A man makes the most of a Sunday afternoon in Playa de Cadavedo by taking a leisurely ride on a horse.Playa del Silencio’s long, silver-coved beach is ideal for strolling, but not swimming due to the strong undercurrent.Spaniards needed nearly 800 more years before they expelled the Moors, but the Battle of Covadonga marked the start of the reversal. The natural setting is breathtaking, with a serpentine road leading up a canyon, past a waterfall and then a small shrine. At the top, shimmering above the mist, rises the majestic, pink-stone Basilica of Santa María la Real de Covadonga.I’ve visited before, but hadn’t taken the time to drive to the lakes above Covadonga in the Picos de Europa (Peaks of Europe) National Park. Now up another winding road I go, bound for those lakes. Trees fall away, and the view opens to a wide sky of cotton ball clouds.More experiences: Try these lesser-known hiking trails in Europe.Then I hear bells. They start softly, but soon their metallic jangle has drowned out the car radio. I round a bend and see sheep, what looks like several hundred of them, painstakingly crossing the road in front of a line of stopped cars.I park and walk into the nearby brush, inhaling air so fresh that it sends a jolt of sharpness into my chest. The spiky peaks of the mountain silently surround me from a distance; all I hear is the din of the sheep bells, sounding like church bells ringing at high noon. A driver honks a horn in frustration, but that only makes the sheep stop in their tracks. With great deliberation, they look around. Satisfied that they can proceed, they resume their shuffle.Eventually the stragglers get across. By now, the traffic probably snakes around the bend and halfway down the mountain. I see the cars start to move, but I can’t walk back just yet. The bells clank and the air crackles and the peaks look like cathedral spires. Around me is a sea of sheep with no shepherd in sight. I’ve never been anywhere like this. I don’t want to leave.",
"On the third Sunday in May, girls donning white bridal dresses clutch holy branches during the annual “Procession of the Hundred Maidens,” a tribute to the hundred maidens paid to the Moors during the Reconquista.Spain’s cuisine, architecture, and beaches lure travelers to its shores, earning it the spot as the second most-visited destination on the globe after France.Aqueducts and ancient ruins, which dot the countryside, are lingering signs from the Romans who once ruled. If you crisscross the country from the northern surf town (and unofficial capital of haute cuisine) San Sebastián along the French border to Andalucía’s ancient port city of Cádiz on the southwestern tip, you’ll discover a landscape as diverse as the people, where Moorish architecture clings to cliffs along the Mediterranean Sea and peaks in the Pyrenees offer up some of the country’s most spectacular hikes.

"Marti Buckley Kilpatrick, an American journalist and cook, has called San Sebastián home for the past three years. This food aficionado with a passion for Basque culinary culture–whether in pintxo form or at a five-hour lunch–points to an ancient local proverb that translates to “Wherever your thoughts go, your feet will follow” as her motto. Here are a few of Marti’s favorite things about this distinctive center of culture.Follow Marti’s story on Twitter and on her blog.When someone comes to visit me, the first place I take them is a pintxo bar. This way of eating, on foot at a bar laden with tiny bites of food there for the taking, is both unique and fun. One of my all-time favorites is Hidalgo 56. The first thing I order is their incredible volcán de morcilla, a cone of blood sausage with an egg yolk perched on top, studded with raisins and accompanied by a swipe of apple compote.Summer is the best time to visit my city because the sun is almost guaranteed to be out and the days are the perfect length for enjoying an aperitif on a terraza during sunset.You can see my city best from the top of Monte Urgull, known locally as the “Jesus mountain.” The rounded peak, which butts up to the old part of the city, is full of nooks and crannies to explore, like an ancient soldier’s graveyard and offers incredible views of San Sebastián, the island of Santa Clara, and fishing boats in the Cantabrian Sea.Locals know to skip ultra-modern, expensive pintxo bars and check out the less-fussy neighborhood spots instead. On Thursdays you can find them packed in the bars in the Gros and Amara districts for pintxo pote, where a pintxo and a drink costs two Euros. Everyone goes.Casa Ponsol for men and Saski-Naski for everyone else is the place to buy authentic, local souvenirs.In the past, notable people like abstract sculptor Eduardo Chillida and star soccer player Xabi Alonso have called my city home. Ernest Hemingway liked to vacation here when he was based in nearby Pamplona.My city’s best museum is Museo de San Telmo because the exhibitions have a notable local flavor, and the building itself is a work of art, combining an old cloister with a new, modern wing.If there’s one thing you should know about getting around my city, it’s that walking is the ideal way to experience San Sebastián, but you should be careful to avoid the bidegorris–“red paths” in Basque–which are for cyclists only.The best place to spend time outdoors in my city is Zurriola beach. The most bustling and lively of the beaches, it’s where the locals go. There are always surfers to watch and it’s even more beautiful when there’s stormy weather.My city really knows how to celebrate Basque culture. They take immense pride in the culture and the language, celebrating the Day of Euskera, ending ceremonies with the traditional aurresku dance, and taking the txilibito (a tiny penny whistle) to just about every celebration.You can tell if someone is from my city if they are speaking Euskera, the native language of Basque, which has absolutely no relation to Spanish.For a fancy night out, I pick one of the many Michelin-starred spots for dinner, finish with a gourmet gin and tonic from Atari on the steps of the Santa Maria church, and then head to the beachside terrace of Bataplan where nightcaps are set to the sea breeze and the dance club is conveniently located right downstairs.Just outside my city, you can visit the quaint fishing village of Getaria, which is tiny but happens to be the birthplace of Balenciaga, home to a museum about his couture, and the place to get to one of the best grilled fish in all of Spain (at Elkano).My city is known for being a difficult place for foreigners to figure out, but it’s really open if you know a few words of Basque and aren’t afraid to ask questions.The best outdoor market in my city is the azoka of farmers from neighboring hills. Basically it’s a pop-up market that is in a different city square every Saturday, and there is everything from bread to yogurt to herbs and vegetables.Oiartzun bakery, with its great people-watching location and incredible brioche served warm off the top of the espresso machine, is my favorite place to grab breakfast, and Va Bene, serving only no-nonsense hamburgers and no french fries, is the spot for late-night eats.To find out what’s going on at night and on the weekends, read donostiakultura.com.My city’s biggest sports event is the Derby, when San Sebastián’s soccer team, Real Sociedad, plays neighboring Bilbao’s (Athletic). Watch it at the Anoeta Stadium, if you can finagle tickets. If not, tuck into one of the raucous bars of Calle 31 de Agosto.When I’m feeling cash-strapped, I stroll along the three beaches, ending up at the Peine de Vientos, an incredibly beautiful iron sculpture By Eduardo Chillida set into the sea wall, where I sit and watch the waves crash with a to-go coffee from the bar at the end of the promenade.To escape the crowds, I take a ten-minute walk and disappear into the forest on one of the many trails that winds through the mountains bordering the city.If my city were a celebrity it’d be Sean Connery because it’s classic and classy, with a very distinct accent. And it’s so darn good-looking.The dish that represents my city best is kokotxas pil-pil, a dish that is omnipresent in the dining societies that dot the city and consists of cod jowls cooked slowly in nothing more than olive oil and garlic. And the gin and tonic is my city’s signature drink–it’s an after-meal drink, taken to levels that are bewildering to foreigners, with the use of many garnishes, premium tonics, and sometimes even dry ice. Even hole-in-the-walls have a decent gin selection with a few top-shelf options.La Bretxa is my favorite building in town because the façade, which towers over the old part of the city, still suggests the bustling, important food market San Sebastián once was.The most random thing about my city is the seemingly spontaneous protests. If the weather’s good, it’s not unusual to find yourself walking down the street with people marching, holding posters, and chanting. For higher wages, for the return of political prisoners, or for animal rights; Basque people love to exercise their rights.Altxerri Jazz Bar is the best place to see live music, but if you’re in the mood to dance, check out the tiny bars on Calle Fermín Calbeton or Friends Disco.The Tamborrada (held on January 20 during the feast of San Sebastián), a festival that consists of 24 hours of drumming by gastronomic societies and groups of revelers, could only happen in my city.In the spring you should wear rain boots.In the summer you should take the ferry (which only runs for three months) out to Santa Clara island in the middle La Concha Bay and focus on soaking up the sunshine and enjoying the long days.In the fall you should attend the San Sebastián Film Festival, one of the biggest in the world. There are blockbusters as well as small Basque films on show at the city’s nicest venues. Even if you don’t see a single movie, the city is buzzing that week in September.In the winter you should not miss one of the festival days, such as Santo Tomas (December 21) or the Tamborrada (January 20), which keep the city’s residents from experiencing seasonal depression.If you have kids (or are a kid at heart), you won’t want to miss the funicular ride up Monte Igueldo, whose destination is an ancient theme park with a rickety roller coaster.The best book about my city is an old paperback called Life and Food in the Basque Country. Technically it’s about the entire region, but it does an incredible job of explaining the culture. Because food is life in Basque Country.When I think about my city, the song that comes to mind is “Paradise” by Coldplay.In 140 characters or less, the world should heart my city because it’s got it all: beach, mountain, culture, and amazing food. But always with a laid-back vibe and authenticity.",
"The world's premier long-distance cycling event is for pros only—but there's nothing stopping you from enjoying some of the world's best bicycle routes by following the Tour de France's annually changing path from dizzying mountain passes to the charms of France's sunny Mediterranean coast.

(Visit these underrated Mediterranean destinations.)",
"While this resort city is renowned for the glitz and glamour of the annual Festival de Cannes, hundreds of years of history lie within the city limits . Some suggest that Cannes was named after the canes that once crowded its shores, and that Napoleon camped on its dunes during his return from Elba. In 1834, the city began its transformation from quiet fishing village to resort town after the wealthy Lord Brougham rested in Cannes during a cholera outbreak in Nice. Captivated by the village, he built a luxurious villa and traveled back every winter for 34 years.Highlights: Stroll the mile-long La Croisette, a coastal stretch of restaurants, hotels, and shops, stop in Le musée de la Castre, visit the Palais des Festivals, and hike the nearby Massif de l'Estérel.",
"Sidi Bou Said, just outside Tunis, TunisiaRome and Barcelona certainly have their charms. But, the two cities are also perfect starting points to dive into the other cultures and communities along the Mediterranean Sea, where there’s so much to discover. For travelers ready to explore around the Mediterranean coasts, we’ve spotlighted five lesser-known towns and cities worth a visit.City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, SpainSpain’s southeastern port city of Valencia is responsible for two majorly tasty exports: paella and horchata. Both culinary creations still can be found all around the city. For a traditional taste of horchata, a drink made from tigernut milk, pull up a chair to one of the marble-topped tables at Horchateria de Santa Caterina, where the walls of painted porcelain tiles will transport you back in time. Order the horchata—they also offer horchata ice cream—with fartons, a long and narrow pastry perfect for aerodynamic horchata dipping.Work off the pastries in the Turia Gardens, an urban park that snakes around the city and under bridges just like Paris’s Seine. The reason why the park is laid out like a river is because it used to actually be one, until a flood in 1957. After that, the river was diverted, leaving the area a fertile ground for walking and cycling paths. Journey to the “mouth” of the former waterway for Valencia’s futuristic Art and Science Museum.For gifts and to-go treats, navigate your way to the Round Square, where vendors hawk handmade lace and ceramics, and the Central Market. Nearly 1,000 stalls fill this indoor fare fair, offering cheeses, fresh juices, wine, croquettes, baguettes, and even chocolate in the shape of baguettes. Don’t feel bad if the goods don’t actually make it back home.Tip: Also along the Turia Gardens, Valencia’s Modern Art Museum (Institut Valencia d’Art Modern) offers free admission on Sundays and Friday nights.After two terror-related attacks in 2015, the tourism industry in Tunisia’s capital city was severely stunted. But this stunning North African city is beginning to draw visitors back.Medina of Tunis, TunisiaTo experience the area’s ancient history, start with the well-preserved ruins of Carthage. Dating back to 814 B.C., this port hub on the Gulf of Tunis is reminiscent of Pompeii, without the overwhelming crowds. Here visitors can see infrastructure created by the Romans and the Phoenicians, including large public baths, an amphitheater, and cemeteries. The nearby village of Sidi Bou Said offers a more modern look at life in Tunisia. The Santorini-style stark white buildings with blue shutters and bougainvillea house shops and cafes to shelter visitors from the heat.Save room in your suitcase for souvenirs from Tunis’s central medina, a main artery of commerce that also doubles as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Under the tangle of covered archways are stalls stuffed with handmade pottery, spices, incense, glass lamps, and intricately woven rugs.Tip: Haggling is standard at the medina, so don’t be afraid to bargain.On the Italian island of Sardinia, Cagliari is divided into two. The newer section of the city exists at sea level, while the older Castello Quarter sits atop a hill that’s accessible by a series of zig-zagged ramps or steep stairs.Sunset on Cagliari, SardiniaDown at the marina, walk up the boulevard-like Largo Carlo Felice to Caffe Svizzero for a cappuccino at the counter amongst wrought iron chandeliers and towering stone archways straight out of The Phantom of the Opera. Follow up the caffeine kick with a sugar high next-door at Originis. This cioccolateria and pasticceria tempts with treats like strawberry and Bavarian cream-filled hearts, cakes with praline and orange jam, and, somewhat surprisingly, chocolates shaped like life-size wrenches, bolts, and hammers.A few blocks north, Largo Carlo Felice intersects with the pedestrian-only street of Via Giuseppe Manno. The shops here are mostly Italian chains, but the end of the road is dominated by the Bastione di Saint Remy, a limestone arched gateway to the Castello Quarter. The building’s double staircase leads to a palm tree-lined terrace with city and harbor views, as well as Cagliari’s medieval side of town. Constructed 800 years ago, the streets in the Castello Quarter are so narrow that they remain shaded even when the sun is directly above. You’ll find plenty of dark antique shops to duck into, peaceful piazzas, and the Romanesque Cattedrale di Cagliari with ornate marblework.Tip: Nature lovers should head to Parco Molentargius Saline, protected wetlands that are home to flocks of flamingoes and other aquatic birds. The site is only a 10 to 15-minute drive from the city.The coastal town of Trapani feels untouched by tourists—lines of laundry frame Juliette balconies, dogs sleep on sidewalks in the afternoon sun, and side streets lead to quiet alcoves along the sea.Unique windmills of Trapani, SicilyTrapani’s walkable historic area is small enough to be explored in a day. For prime people-watching, park yourself in front of the baroque Palazzo Senatorio, preferably with a scoop of gelato tucked into a brioche roll from Ferlito Gelateria.To see Trapani from a lofty perspective, catch the nearby cable car, or funivia, for a 10-minute ride to the top of Mount Erice. Here you’ll find the medieval town of Erice, which includes the Norman-built Castello di Venere (Castle of Venus). Made with stones from a former temple to Venus, it’s easy to fall for the castle’s panoramic cliffside views and groomed gardens.Back on sea level, finish the day at Cantina Siciliana with a plate of busiate al pesto trapanese, a local specialty of ringlet curl-shaped pasta with tomatoes, almonds, olive oil, and an extra-large serving of garlic.Tip: The Trapani to Erice cable car is only open seasonally, so be sure to check availability. Travelers visiting during the off-season can take a quick taxi ride to the top of the mountain.Known for its pearls, almonds, and mega yachts, Mallorca is an island escape with a cosmopolitan edge. The capital, Palma, named for its abundance of palm trees, is actually one of the largest cities in Spain. Stroll down the arched promenades of Palma’s main commercial shopping street, Avenue de James III, and along the fresh flower stalls of Passé de Las Ramblas, a smaller version of Barcelona’s popular boulevard. But, whenever hunger strikes, bypass the major roads for any of the winding side streets. Our recommendation? El Tunel, carved out of a stone archway, for tapas, followed by the cozy Bodega Can Riga for local cheeses and wines by the glass.Harbor of Palma, MallorcaOnce you get outside of town, bustling roads turn into groves of almond, olive, and carob trees, interrupted only by the occasional Spanish tiled home. A 30-minute drive north of Palma is the quaint mountain town of Valldemossa, centered around its monastery. Bright green shutters and hillside stone homes are the norm here, and instead of using numbers to mark addresses, there are colorful tiles depicting religious scenes at each abode.The real religious experience here are the town's beloved pastries: Coca patata (a potato roll covered in powdered sugar) and gato d'ametlles (almond cake). Try them both with a cup of hot xocolata (chocolate) on the back terrace at Ca'n Molinas, surrounded by orange trees and chirping birds.Tip: There’s a great view of Palma’s vast, yacht-filled harbor from the Gothic-style Bellver Castle, which is only a 10-minute drive from the city center.",
"The Cathedral of Málaga towers over the city.Overtourism has overtaken the grand avenues of Barcelona and the ancient alleys of Madrid. For a charming alternative to these popular destinations, head to Málaga, Spain’s sixth largest city, which offers a taste of Andalusia and its unique landscapes, gastronomy, and architecture.Thanks to its busy international airport, which handles traffic for the entire Costa del Sol, Málaga is easily accessible—and an ideal stop for a long weekends. Admire the works of Pablo Picasso, wander the awe-inspiring Alcazaba, and savor fresh seafood on sun-drenched beaches. Here’s how to explore this jewel on the Mediterranean.Down at the Plaza de la Merced, early-rising Malagueños enjoy breakfast surrounded by piles of Spanish novels in the buzzing Café con Libros—a themed café located in the shadow of Pablo Picasso’s childhood home. Start your day with an order of pitufos (miniature loaves of fresh, warm bread stuffed with tomatoes), cheese, or jamón serrano (cured ham).The nearby Palacio de Buenavista, the 16th-century building where Picasso was born, is now home to the Museo Picasso, which hosts 285 works by Spain’s most iconic artist. There’s plenty of history underfoot, too. Beneath the Andalusian tiles are the ruins of the Phoenician culture that established the city of Malaka in the eighth century B.C., making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. A visit to the archaeological exhibit in the basement gives visitors a fascinating view of the city’s origins.Málaga’s Phoenician, Roman, and Moorish history is also on display throughout the city. Take a five-minute walk from the Museo Picasso, through the ancient 220-seat Teatro Romano amphitheater, and then up to the immaculately well-preserved Alcazaba, a sprawling Moorish military fortress.This legacy of cultural exchange is also captured in Málaga’s unique food culture, which combines the land and sea in a burst of flavors. For the best local produce and recipes, head to the monumental Mercado de Atarazanas, a 19th-century hall filled with bustling crowds who stand shoulder to shoulder while ordering plates of Malagueño specialties. Order the vibrant seafood paella, thick with loose-skinned tomatoes and musky Arabian saffron. And don’t miss the conchas finas: fresh clams soused in a Spanish-style garlic butter, which is flavored with parsley and local sherry.For the residents of Málaga, Sundays are days for strolling through the city, sitting on the beach, and dining on fresh seafood. Start your day with a visit to the Cathedral of Málaga, which locals affectionately call La Manquita (the one-armed woman). It’s a mixture of classical fluted columns, Gothic towers, and lavish interiors. Tours of the building, including a rooftop walk, can be arranged directly through the cathedral. Outside, the bell tower rings out over the neighborhood, and you can purchase gastronomic souvenirs like the Tarta Malagueña, a famous Andalusian spice cake made from almonds, fruit, and wine.Next, head to the port to soak in the city’s impressive coastal landscape, dominated to the north by the Montes de Málaga, a green-and-dun massif that twinkles with white haciendas and flashes of purple bougainvillea. The brightly colored Centre Pompidou, a giant plexiglass outpost of Paris’s famous art gallery, complements the harbor’s natural hues. On Sundays, the port is packed with market stalls filled with handmade jewelry, vintage clothing, and regional produce, including lightbulb-shaped jars of golden honey, which is locally harvested and studded with Andalusian almonds.The port is also the beginning of Playa de la Malagueta, the gray-brown beach that runs east for four miles towards the beach area of El Chanquete. On Sundays, all of Málaga comes out to walk, jog, scoot, and cycle this dazzling section of the Costa del Sol. Look out for the small, refurbished boats lining the shore that have been converted into barbecues for grilling fresh catch. Stop at the beachfront Andres Maricuchi, where you can savor the traditional espeto, grilled sardines with sea salt.On the third Sunday in May, girls donning white bridal dresses clutch holy branches during the annual “Procession of the Hundred Maidens,” a tribute to the hundred maidens paid to the Moors during the Reconquista.If there’s one food experience in the city that’s worth traveling the five miles to El Chanquete, it’s El Tintero. While the long walk up the quiet beach is like drawing in breath, this hectic, supermarket-sized seafood restaurant is a bellow of release. Don’t expect anything as conventional as a menu; the waiters simply stroll around carrying platters of whatever is freshest from the kitchen. It’s up to the bravest diners to decide what they like before another hungry soul waylays the parading server first. El Tintero is a fundamentally Spanish way of enjoying food when surrounded by friends and family.",
"Global tourism is on the rise. There was a six percent increase in worldwide travelers in 2017, and nearly 52 percent of Americans plan to visit Europe in the next two years, according the World Tourism Organization. While this increased travel has its benefits—growing economies, connecting communities, encouraging a greater understanding of the world—it also has its drawbacks.Over-tourism is taxing on a destination’s infrastructure, residents, and natural landscapes. In Europe, that often means cities facing gridlocked roadways and crowded architectural wonders, but the congestion isn’t isolated to urban locales. Popular trails and hiking routes, like Italy’s Cinque Terre and France’s Tour du Mont Blanc, also receive a staggering number of annual visitors, causing heavy foot traffic through the continent’s most pristine mountainous areas.To avoid the crowds in Europe’s most famous natural landscapes, opt to hike the continent’s under-the-radar regions, where trails weave through idyllic coastal towns, mountain-top monasteries, and picturesque waterfalls and river gorges.Spanning 466 miles through Austria, Slovenia, and Italy, the Alpe Adria trail begins at Grossglockner, the highest mountain in Austria, and connects to Muggia, a coastal town in northeast Italy.This 43-stage, long-distance trail typically takes over a month to hike. Most trekkers conquer two to five stages of the trail at a time, over a period of four days to two weeks. From Carinthia’s mountain lakes to the vertical walls and sheer cliffs of Friuli-Venezia Giulia’s portion of the Dolomite Mountains, this route has been described as a trip through the Garden of Eden. (Related: Top 10 Ski Runs & Lodges)On a 10-day trip with Mountain Travel Sobek, hike 60 miles of the route’s most beautiful stretches, from Salzburg, Austria, to Trieste, Italy. Trek beyond mountain lakes and rivers to uncover the region’s highest summits and lush valleys, going past landmarks like Austria’s Garnet Gate and Italy’s Sanctuary of Monte Lussari. In just one day, hike through all three countries and end the trip with a morning summit of the 5,285-foot peak of Vršič, the highest mountain pass in Slovenia.Mountaintop monasteries, like the Philosophou Monastery, perch precariously throughout Lousios Gorge.While visitors often flock to Greece for its historic locales—like Athens, Delphi, and Santorini—or colorful islands, there’s plenty of rugged hiking trails beyond the country’s famed cities and Mediterranean isles. While traversing the Lousios Gorge region in the Peloponnese peninsula, begin in Karytaina and continue north to Dimitsana, a route seldom traveled, where wildflowers grow in abundance near babbling streams and meadows peppered with towering cypress trees and olive groves.During a trip with Peregrine Adventures, spend a day hiking an easy nine-mile portion of the Lousios Gorge, passing stunning mountaintop monasteries along a wild stretch of unpaved trail. Wind through the medieval village of Karitena, near the confluence of the gorge, before traveling to the terracotta-rooftop towns of Stemnitsa and Andritsena. Visit the nearby Prodromos monastery to mingle with local monks and learn how the wood and clay structure was built precariously into the rock face. End at the 10th-century Byzantine monastery of Philosophou, once the base of a monk-run secret school, known as a krifó scholió, developed during Ottoman rule to teach youth their native language and religion.The Cape Finisterre lighthouse is only one of many hikers will see along the Camino de Santiago trail.While hikers are drawn to the Camino de Santiago to complete Spain’s most famous pilgrimage, the alternative (yet equally as compelling) Camino dos Faros coastal trail is the country’s under-the-radar gem. It weaves through the rugged, wild terrain of Costa da Morte on the Atlantic coast of Galicia, Spain.Also known as Lighthouse Way, Camino dos Faros was built by a cohort of local volunteers and is replete with noteworthy archaeological heritage. The trail spans nearly 125 miles through Galicia’s capes and headlands.During a trek with On Foot Holidays, trace a challenging 10-day portion of the route, a journey of sunrise-to-sunset days on the trail covering soaring cliff-top stretches for serious trekkers. The route hugs wild coastal terrain peppered with lighthouses, quaint villages, and plenty of empty beaches, finishing at the lighthouse at Cape Finisterre, which converges with a stretch of the Camino de Santiago. This rocky peninsula proves an ideal haven for harbor-to-plate seafood, the town’s premiere industry.See the iconic Tuscan landscape while on the La Via Francigena Pilgrimage route to Buonconvento.Although La Via Francigena is one of Europe’s least known pilgrimage routes, many believe it’s one of the best. During the Middle Ages, this medieval route once connected Canterbury to Rome, passing through England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. Italy’s 587-mile portion of the route takes roughly 90 days to complete at a pace of at least 12 to 13 miles per day.During a trip with Wilderness Travel, the first adventure travel company to offer a trek through this mostly unmarked route, hike the path of the pilgrims for 10 days, covering some of the trail’s most iconic scenery. Beginning in Siena, cross through historic towns and hamlets where cobbled Roman roads and amphitheaters and ancient Etruscan tombs are visible. Hike to Buonconvento, an iconic stop in a Tuscan landscape flush with golden wheat fields, olive groves, and dense forests home to hot springs. After trekking through the towns of Montefiascone, Viterbo, Capranica, and Sutri, the trail’s finale leads to Rome, and trekkers finish the route by walking directly into St. Peter’s Square.",
"Many dream of visiting the Taj Mahal, walking across the Peace Bridge, or taking in the breathtaking alpine views atop Mount Everest.

"GEORGES-MARIE HAARDT was one of those latter- day explorers who completed the first journey on wheels across Central Asia. Covering 8,000 miles, the trip’s purpose was to open up the Silk Road to cars. “Across desert wastes and windswept plateaus, over snow-clad mountain passes, through strange lands where ancient civilizations flourished, and into vast, mysterious, teeming China—such will be the route of the Citroën Trans-Asiatic Expedition, which left [Beirut] in April....,” began Haardt in his June 1931 story for National Geographic, which co-sponsored the trip and sent along Maynard Owen Williams, its chief of foreign staff, as expedition photographer. (The magazine would publish five stories from 1931- 1940 and three more from 1988.)Political uncertainties led to a change in the itinerary; impassable routes in Kashmir led to splitting into two to increase the odds of success. Haardt’s group went through the Himalayas, where it encountered unimaginable hardships; often the mechanics had to dismantle and reassemble their vehicles due to the cruel mountainous trails. Still, the groups met up in October to set out together to Beijing, arriving on Feb. 12,1932. Although Pakistan isn’t an obvious choice for travel, part of this journey can be re-created these days in the peaceful region called Hunza Valley, with its stunning variety of landscapes, from glaciers to flowering meadows.",

"Chobe National Park in Botswana holds one of Africa’s largest elephant populations.What images come to mind when you hear the words “African safari”? Sitting in the bush on a moonlit night, so close to a lion that you can feel the rumble of its roar in your chest?Many travelers might conjure up visions of tented camps, gourmet meals under a baobab tree, game drives through golden savanna, and sundowners at the end of the day. But safaris can also involve self-guided rental cars, game walks, and fly-fishing. Safaris can be as varied as the continent of Africa itself.One recent trend: expeditions that enlist travelers in the fight to save endangered wildlife. Tourists make a difference by joining rhino or lion conservationists at work in South Africa or accompanying researchers working on a chimpanzee habituation project in Kibale National Park in Uganda. (Read about the dark truth behind wildlife tourism.)Three zebras line a waterhole in South Africa's Kruger National Park.No matter where you go and what type of safari you choose, timing is key. Once you’ve narrowed your options, look into the best time to visit. South Africa’s summer (December through February), for example, is prime safari season in that region. You’ll still see wildlife if you go during South Africa’s winter (June through August), but pack a jacket, as temperatures can be chilly, especially before the sun rises.Set off into the wild and see the world like never before with our guide to top safari experiences in 11 African countries.Spot animals in these natural wonders.Kruger National Park: South Africa’s largest game reserve, Kruger National Park makes a perfect home base for self-guided and first-time safaris. Stay in one of the park’s fenced camps, such as the Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp on the northern bank of the Crocodile River. Head into the bush early to explore the Southern Circle, famous for its competing lion prides and their varied hunting practices. Don’t miss the nearby hippo pool, but be sure to stay in your car outside of the camp. (Take a solo safari through South Africa’s wild grasslands.)Hazyview: Not far from Kruger’s southwestern Phabeni Gate, Hazyview is a family-friendly hub for horseback safaris, zip-lining, safari golf, and trout fishing. Check in to one of the lodges, such as Hippo Hollow Country Estate, and then head out into the Kruger before sunrise on a self-guided game drive to scout lions and white rhinos. Break for lunch in the town of Skukuza.Timbavati Private Nature Reserve: The rugged Timbavati is one of the private nature reserves that make up the greater Kruger area. Guests can choose from eight lodges there. An upscale chalet at fence-free Simbavati Safari Lodges, for example, is perfect for families.

Visit between December and April, and stay at traditional Camp Nomade, its tents decorated with local carpets and brass bells.",
"From vibrant tulips to delicate cherry blossoms to surprisingly hardy orchids, flowering plants cover the planet. It’s easy to be swept away by their eye-catching colors, but these buds are so much more than meets the eye.To botanists, flowering plants are called angiosperms, from the Greek words for “vessel” and “seed.” Unlike conifers, which produce seeds in open cones (conifers thrived for 200 million years before the first bloom appeared), angiosperms enclose their seeds in fruit. This trait led to the success of this plant group, which numbers some 235,000 species.“[Flowers] began changing the way the world looked almost as soon as they appeared on Earth about 130 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. But once they took firm root about 100 million years ago, they swiftly diversified in an explosion of varieties that established most of the flowering plant families of the modern world,” writes Nat Geo’s Michael Klesius. “As a food source flowering plants provide us and the rest of the animal world with the nourishment that is fundamental to our existence.”From the gardens of Iceland to the mountains of Nepal, here are 10 places to celebrate abundance—and beauty—in the natural world.Travelers can find a wealth of plant species in North Carolina’s mountains—the most in any similarly sized area in North America.

"A South African monkey beetle burrows deep into the center of a Gazania flower to feed on flower parts. The beetle then emerges with a luxuriant coat of pollen, which it carries to other flowers. Enticed by nectar and other payoffs, animals become flowering plants' unwitting partners in pollen transport.In the summer of 1973 sunflowers appeared in my father's vegetable garden. They seemed to sprout overnight in a few rows he had lent that year to new neighbors from California. Only six years old at the time, I was at first put off by these garish plants. Such strange and vibrant flowers seemed out of place among the respectable beans, peppers, spinach, and other vegetables we had always grown. Gradually, however, the brilliance of the sunflowers won me over. Their fiery halos relieved the green monotone that by late summer ruled the garden. I marveled at birds that clung upside down to the shaggy, gold disks, wings fluttering, looting the seeds. Sunflowers defined flowers for me that summer and changed my view of the world.Flowers have a way of doing that. They began changing the way the world looked almost as soon as they appeared on Earth about 130 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. That's relatively recent in geologic time: If all Earth's history were compressed into an hour, flowering plants would exist for only the last 90 seconds. But once they took firm root about 100 million years ago, they swiftly diversified in an explosion of varieties that established most of the flowering plant families of the modern world.Today flowering plant species outnumber by twenty to one those of ferns and cone-bearing trees, or conifers, which had thrived for 200 million years before the first bloom appeared. As a food source flowering plants provide us and the rest of the animal world with the nourishment that is fundamental to our existence. In the words of Walter Judd, a botanist at the University of Florida, "If it weren't for flowering plants, we humans wouldn't be here."From oaks and palms to wildflowers and water lilies, across the miles of cornfields and citrus orchards to my father's garden, flowering plants have come to rule the worlds of botany and agriculture. They also reign over an ethereal realm sought by artists, poets, and everyday people in search of inspiration, solace, or the simple pleasure of beholding a blossom."Before flowering plants appeared," says Dale Russell, a paleontologist with North Carolina State University and the State Museum of Natural Sciences, "the world was like a Japanese garden: peaceful, somber, green; inhabited by fish, turtles, and dragonflies. After flowering plants, the world became like an English garden, full of bright color and variety, visited by butterflies and honeybees. Flowers of all shapes and colors bloomed among the greenery."That dramatic change represents one of the great moments in the history of life on the planet. What allowed flowering plants to dominate the world's flora so quickly? What was their great innovation?Botanists call flowering plants angiosperms, from the Greek words for "vessel" and "seed." Unlike conifers, which produce seeds in open cones, angiosperms enclose their seeds in fruit. Each fruit contains one or more carpels, hollow chambers that protect and nourish the seeds. Slice a tomato in half, for instance, and you'll find carpels. These structures are the defining trait of all angiosperms and one key to the success of this huge plant group, which numbers some 235,000 species.Just when and how did the first flowering plants emerge? Charles Darwin pondered that question, and paleobotanists are still searching for an answer. Throughout the 1990s discoveries of fossilized flowers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America offered important clues. At the same time the field of genetics brought a whole new set of tools to the search. As a result, modern paleobotany has undergone a boom not unlike the Cretaceous flower explosion itself.Now old-style fossil hunters with shovels and microscopes compare notes with molecular biologists using genetic sequencing to trace modern plant families backward to their origins. These two groups of researchers don't always arrive at the same birthplace, but both camps agree on why the quest is important."If we have an accurate picture of the evolution of a flowering plant," says Walter Judd, "then we can know things about its structure and function that will help us answer certain questions: What sorts of species can it be crossed with? What sorts of pollinators are effective?" This, he says, takes us toward ever more sensible and productive methods of agriculture, as well as a clearer understanding of the larger process of evolution.Elizabeth Zimmer, a molecular biologist with the Smithsonian Institution, has been rethinking that process in recent years. Zimmer has been working to decipher the genealogy of flowering plants by studying the DNA of today's species. Her work accelerated in the late 1990s during a federally funded study called Deep Green, developed to foster coordination among scientists studying plant evolution.Zimmer and her colleagues began looking in their shared data for groups of plants with common inherited traits, hoping eventually to identify a common ancestor to all flowering plants. Results to date indicate that the oldest living lineage, reaching back at least 130 million years, is Amborellaceae, a family that includes just one known species, Amborella trichopoda. Often described as a "living fossil," this small woody plant grows only on New Caledonia, a South Pacific island famous among botanists for its primeval flora.But we don't have an Amborella from 130 million years ago, so we can only wonder if it looked the same as today's variety. We do have fossils of other extinct flowering plants, the oldest buried in 130-million-year-old sediments. These fossils give us our only tangible hints of what early flowers looked like, suggesting they were tiny and unadorned, lacking showy petals. These no-frill flowers challenge most notions of what makes a flower a flower.To see what the first primitive angiosperm might have looked like, I flew to England and there met paleobotanist Chris Hill, formerly with London's Natural History Museum. Hill drove me through rolling countryside to Smokejacks Brickworks, a quarry south of London. Smokejacks is a hundred-foot-deep (30-meter-deep) hole in the ground, as wide as several football fields, that has been offering up a lot more than raw material for bricks. Its rust-colored clays have preserved thousands of fossils from about 130 million years ago. We marched to the bottom of the quarry, got down on our hands and knees, and began digging.Soon Hill lifted a chunk of mudstone. He presented it to me and pointed to an imprint of a tiny stem that terminated in a rudimentary flower. The fossil resembled a single sprout plucked from a head of broccoli. The world's first flower? More like a prototype of a flower, said Hill, who made his initial fossil find here in the early 1990s. He officially named it Bevhalstia pebja, words cobbled from the names of his closest colleagues.Through my magnifying glass the Bevhalstia fossil appeared small and straggly, an unremarkable weed I might see growing in the water near the edge of a pond, which is where Hill believes it grew."Here's why I think it could be a primitive flowering plant," said Hill. "Bevhalstia is unique and unassignable to any modern family of plants. So we start by comparing it to what we know." The stems of some modern aquatic plants share the same branching patterns as Bevhalstia and grow tiny flower buds at the ends of certain branches. Bevhalstia also bears a striking resemblance to a fossil reported in 1990 by American paleobotanists Leo Hickey and Dave Taylor. That specimen, a diminutive 120-million-year-old plant from Australia, grew leaves that are neither fernlike nor needlelike. Instead they are inlaid with veins like the leaves of modern flowering plants.More important, Hickey and Taylor's specimen contains fossilized fruits that once enclosed seeds, something Hill hopes to find associated with Bevhalstia. Both plants lack defined flower petals. Both are more primitive than the magnolia, recently dethroned as the earliest flower, although still considered an ancient lineage. And both, along with a recent find from China known as Archaefructus, have buttressed the idea that the very first flowering plants were simple and inconspicuous.Like all pioneers, early angiosperms got their start on the margins. In a world dominated by conifers and ferns, these botanical newcomers managed to get a toehold in areas of ecological disturbance, such as floodplains and volcanic regions, and adapted quickly to new environments. Fossil evidence leads some botanists to believe that the first flowering plants were herbaceous, meaning they grew no woody parts. (The latest genetic research, however, indicates that most ancient angiosperm lines included both herbaceous and woody plants.) Unlike trees, which require years to mature and bear seed, herbaceous angiosperms live, reproduce, and die in short life cycles. This enables them to seed new ground quickly and perhaps allowed them to evolve faster than their competitors, advantages that may have helped give rise to their diversity.While this so-called herbaceous habit might have given them an edge over slow-growing woody plants, the angiosperms' trump card was the flower. In simple terms, a flower is the reproductive mechanism of an angiosperm. Most flowers have both male and female parts. Reproduction begins when a flower releases pollen, microscopic packets of genetic material, into the air. Eventually these grains come to rest on another flower's stigma, a tiny pollen receptor. In most cases the stigma sits atop a stalk-like structure called a style that protrudes from the center of a flower. Softened by moisture, the pollen grain releases proteins that chemically discern whether the new plant is genetically compatible. If so, the pollen grain germinates and grows a tube down through the style and ovary and into the ovule, where fertilization occurs and a seed begins to grow.Casting pollen to the wind is a hit-or-miss method of reproduction. Although wind pollination suffices for many plant species, direct delivery by insects is far more efficient. Insects doubtless began visiting and pollinating angiosperms as soon as the new plants appeared on Earth some 130 million years ago. But it would be another 30 or 40 million years before flowering plants grabbed the attention of insect pollinators by flaunting flashy petals."Petals didn't evolve until between 90 and 100 million years ago," said Else Marie Friis, head of paleobotany at the Swedish Natural History Museum on the outskirts of Stockholm. "Even then, they were very, very small.A thoughtful woman with short brown hair and intense eyes, Friis oversees what many experts say is the most complete collection of angiosperm fossils gathered in one place. The fragile flowers escaped destruction, oddly enough, thanks to the intense heat of long-ago forest fires that baked them into charcoal.Friis showed me an 80-million-year-old fossil flower no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence. Coated with pure gold for maximum resolution under an electron microscope, it seemed to me hardly a flower. "Many researchers had overlooked these tiny, simple flowers," she said, "because you cannot grasp their diversity without the microscope."So we squinted through her powerful magnifier and took a figurative walk through a Cretaceous world of tiny and diverse angiosperms. Enlarged hundreds or thousands of times, Friis's fossilized flowers resemble wrinkled onion bulbs or radishes. Many have kept their tiny petals clamped shut, hiding the carpels within. Others reach wide open in full maturity. Dense bunches of pollen grains cling to each other in gnarled clumps.Sometime between 70 and 100 million years ago the number of flowering plant species on Earth exploded, an event botanists refer to as the "great radiation." The spark that ignited that explosion, said Friis, was the petal."Petals created much more diversity. This is now a widely accepted notion," Friis said. In their new finery, once overlooked angiosperms became standouts in the landscape, luring insect pollinators as never before. Reproduction literally took off.Interaction between insects and flowering plants shaped the development of both groups, a process called coevolution. In time flowers evolved arresting colors, alluring fragrances, and special petals that provide landing pads for their insect pollinators. Uppermost in the benefits package for insects is nectar, a nutritious fluid flowers provide as a type of trading commodity in exchange for pollen dispersal. The ancestors of bees, butterflies, and wasps grew dependent on nectar, and in so doing became agents of pollen transport, inadvertently carrying off grains hitched to tiny hairs on their bodies. These insects could pick up and deliver pollen with each visit to new flowers, raising the chances of fertilization.Insects weren't the only obliging species to help transport flowering plants to every corner of the Earth. Dinosaurs, the greatest movers and shakers the world has ever known, bulldozed through ancient forests, unwittingly clearing new ground for angiosperms. They also sowed seeds across the land by way of their digestive tracts.By the time the first flowering plant appeared, plant-eating dinosaurs had been around for a million centuries, all the while living on a diet of ferns, conifers, and other primordial vegetation. Dinosaurs survived for another 65 million years, and some scientists think this was plenty of time for the big reptiles to adapt to a new diet that included angiosperms."Just before the dinosaurs disappeared, I think a lot of them were chowing down on flowering plants," says Kirk Johnson of the Denver Museum of Nature & Science. Johnson has unearthed many fossils between 60 and 70 million years old from sites across the Rocky Mountain region. From them he deduces that hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, subsisted on large angiosperm leaves that had evolved in a warm climatic shift just before the Cretaceous period ended. Referring to sediments that just predate the dinosaur extinction, he said, "I've only found a few hundred samples of nonflowering plants there, but I've recovered 35,000 specimens of angiosperms. There's no doubt the dinosaurs were eating these things."Early angiosperms were low-growing, a fact that suited some dinosaurs better than others. "Brachiosaurs had long necks like giraffes, so they were poorly equipped for eating the new vegetation," says Richard Cifelli, a paleontologist with the University of Oklahoma. "On the other hand ceratopsians and duck-billed dinosaurs were real mowing machines." Behind those mowers angiosperms adapted to freshly cut ground and kept spreading.Dinosaurs disappeared suddenly about 65 million years ago, and another group of animals took their place—the mammals, which greatly profited from the diversity of angio-sperm fruits, including grains, nuts, and many vegetables. Flowering plants, in turn, reaped the benefits of seed dispersal by mammals."It was two kingdoms making a handshake," says David Dilcher, a paleobotanist with the Florida Museum of Natural History. "I'll feed you, and you take my genetic material some distance away."Eventually humans evolved, and the two kingdoms made another handshake. Through agriculture angiosperms met our need for sustenance. We in turn have taken certain species like corn and rice and given them unprecedented success, cultivating them in vast fields, pollinating them deliberately, consuming them with gusto. Virtually every nonmeat food we eat starts as a flowering plant, while the meats, milk, and eggs we consume come from livestock fattened on grains—flowering plants. Even the cotton we wear is an angiosperm.Aesthetically, too, angiosperms sustain and enrich our lives. We've come to value them for their beauty alone, their scents, their companionship in a vase, a pot, on Valentine's Day. Some flowers speak an ancient language where words fall short. For these more dazzling players—the orchids, the roses, the lilies—the world grows smaller, crisscrossed every day by jet-setting flowers in the cargo holds of commercial transport planes."We try to deliver flowers anywhere in the world within 24 hours of when they're cut," said Jan Lanning, a senior consultant with the Dutch Floricultural Wholesale Board, the world's turnstile for ornamental flowers. "The business has really globalized."On my way home from Friis's lab in Sweden, I had stopped in the Netherlands, the world's largest exporter of cut flowers. I asked Lanning to try to explain the meaning of his chosen work. He leaned forward with a ready answer."People have been fascinated by flowers as long as we've existed. It's an emotional product. People are attracted to living things. Smell, sight, beauty are all combined in a flower." He smiled at an arrangement of fragrant lilies on his desk. "Every Monday a florist delivers fresh flowers to this office. It is a necessary luxury."Later that day in Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum I spied a group of admirers crowded before a painting. I made my way there and pressed in among them. Suddenly I was staring at "Sunflowers," one of van Gogh's most famous works. In the painting the flowers lean out of a vase, furry and disheveled. They transported me to my barefoot youth at the edge of my dad's garden on a humid summer evening alive with fireflies and the murmur of cicadas.The crowd moved on, and I was alone with "Sunflowers." My quest had come to this unexpected conclusion, an image of the first flower I can remember. Did van Gogh elevate the flower to an art form, or did the flower harness van Gogh's genius to immortalize itself in oils and brushstrokes? Flowering plants have conquered more than just the land. They have sent roots deep into our minds and hearts. We know we are passing through their world as through a museum, for they were here long before we arrived and may well remain long after we are gone.",
"The Netherlands, which produces some 90 percent of the world’s tulips, has seen its renowned floral market wilt before. The most famous instance was back in the 1630s, when tulpenmanie (tulip mania) meant the value of a single flower bulb soared up to 10 times the average worker’s annual income before the market suddenly crashed in 1637.Prices didn’t exactly bottom out in the spring of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced borders to snap shut. But lockdowns and market closures meant the worldwide demand for the country’s famed flowers and bulbs dropped significantly. Dutch growers had to destroy hundreds of millions of tulips, daffodils, and other blossoms or sell them at far cheaper prices than in past years.“A total of 11.4 billion flowers and plants were traded in the Netherlands in 2020, a decrease of 7.8 percent compared to 2019,” says Michel van Schie, a spokesperson for industry conglomerate Royal FloraHolland. The country’s international export market wilted from 6.235 billion euros (7.583 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019 to 5.974 billion euros (7.266 billion U.S. dollars) in 2020.Last spring, COVID-19 border closures and lockdowns meant the Netherland’s floral market crashed along with its tourism. Demand plunged from customers like restaurants and hotels as well as for events like weddings. This severely impacted farms, sellers, flower auction houses, and tourism during blooming season, which generally runs from mid-March to early May.In this charming Dutch village, boats replace cars.“I had to leave one 5,381-square-foot greenhouse of daffodils to die before destroying them with a machine,” says Klaas van Hage, who runs a flower farm in Noordwijkerhout. Like many growers, Van Hage had to trash about 10 percent of his crop in 2020, shredding it for compost or giving flowers to charity.“We had a total of 79 acres of bulbs in 2020,” says Caroline Dignum, who owns a tulip, daffodil, and crocus farm with her husband Ronald in North Holland. “It was sad, we had to destroy a lot of bulbs that demanded a lot of work and care.” The couple composted 7.41 acres of tulip bulbs out of 61-plus acres they had planted, a loss of some $180,000.Floral auctions, run by Royal FloraHolland in several Dutch towns such as Rijnsburg, were also severely affected by COVID-19. Normally, hundreds of bidders would enter outsize warehouses for weekday auctions, taking in tulips, roses, and daffodils from second-story walkways above the sales floor. It all happens via Dutch auction, meaning prices start high and drop until people start to bid.“Before the pandemic, nearly 900 people could bid on flowers at a time,” says Marjan van der Plas, a Royal FloraHolland auctioneer. Now, only about a hundred buyers are allowed inside at once, and many bids come from online.“I miss the personal interaction,” says Linda de Ruiter, another Royal FloraHolland auctioneer. “That feeling when the buyers used to see the products with their own eyes on the stage is gone.”The tulip and floral industry in the Netherlands is said to have started with single a tulband bulb. Relatives of the lily, the herbaceous plants originated in Asia and came to the Netherlands via Turkey, brought back by Dutch shipping merchants in the prosperous 17th century. The name may have been inspired after the turbans then worn by Turkish men.The enterprising spirit and infrastructure of the Dutch (as well as an ideal growing climate) enabled them to plant tulips on the map. Gardeners became experts at developing new varieties for wealthy landowners; the country’s waterways and roads helped transport them to market. Tulips became all the rage in 17th-century Europe, and today, there are some 4,000 varieties in nearly every color except blue. Stripes and streaks in many of them originated via viruses.Field after field of red tulips, purple hyacinths, and yellow daffodils started blooming across the Bollenstreek (bulb region) in the western Netherlands in March and April of 2021. Combined with an uptick in flower sales, those in the industry see the flowers as signs of renewal and hope.“Everybody in my region is feeling optimistic this year,” says Dignum. “There’s a great demand for flowers and bulbs, a big difference over last year when everyone felt insecure and unsure about what was happening.”Some farmers have adjusted their businesses due to the pandemic. Some planted their wares so they could sell fresh tulips instead of importing bulbs. Others, like Klaas van Hage, are now selling more products in the Netherlands to make up for losses in the international market. “We have contracts with major local supermarkets and hardly export our products,” he says. “We are lucky.”Blooms and buds are a major tourist draw for the Netherlands. In 2019 around 1.5 million people from 100 countries visited Keukenhof garden during its spring season. The 79-acre park in Lisse (about 16 miles southwest of Amsterdam)—which typically just opens from March to early May—only offered virtual tours in 2020 due to the pandemic.Here are 10 of the world’s best destinations for blooms.In 2021, as part of a pilot program with the Dutch government, Keukenhof welcomed 5,000 visitors a day. Timed-entry passes and a recent negative COVID-19 test were required to take in the millions of colorful flowers, which grow around a 19th-century windmill and a turreted 17th-century castle. A rapid-testing center was set up close to the park entrance.“It’s the highlight of my year,” says Mevouw Both, 90, who toured Keukenhof the first day it was open in 2021.  “I visited regularly for many years, but I couldn’t in 2020 due to the pandemic.”It all feels—and certainly looks—like a rebirth for the country and the industry. As farmer Caroline Dignum says, “the moment we plant the bulb, it is like watching our own child growing up in front of our eyes.”The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted travel.

"A boat plies a canal in Giethoorn, a Dutch village built on small peat islands without roads or cars.In the tiny Dutch village of Giethoorn, the tranquility is almost dreamlike. That is, until you remember why it's so quiet—there are no cars. In fact, there’s no way for cars to get around, because there are no roads. Locals and visitors to Giethoorn navigate in whisper-quiet ways: by bike, boat, or foot. In this hamlet—a collection of small peat islands connected by bridges—there's not much to do except slip into solitude among thatched-roof farmhouses and footbridges crossing the maze of canals.The village’s name harkens back to the 13th century (an era in which it seems to have settled). The story goes that its original farmer-settlers discovered a collection of horns belonging to wild goats thought to have died in the Flood of 1170. “Goat horn,” or “Geytenhoren,” was shortened to Giethoorn, and the name stuck. Centuries post-flood, water continues to define the village's living history and landscape.In nearby De Weerribben-Wieden National Park, wildlife enthusiasts hike wetlands and reed beds home to otters, black terns, great cormorants, and egrets. You can traverse by waterway on rowboats and canoes, of course, or by the many hiking paths. Without motor noise pollution, the sounds of nature bring the scenery to life for all the senses.Jan Brouwer, a Your Shot photographer, recently captured the serenity of Giethoorn along a stretch of the canal called Binnenpad, which Brouwer recommends as a particularly stunning area to view the village’s bridges and homes. To appreciate the golden hours of the day, set your alarm for 6 a.m. and head out to take photos along the canal before boats get on the water. Or, wait until after 6 p.m. when visitors tend to disperse. This alone makes the case for staying a night in one of the abundant local bed-and-breakfasts and avoiding day-tour-circuit congestion.You can get to Giethoorn by a combination of train and bus. To avoid crowds, opt for the months of April, May, June, or September, and keep in mind that weekday visits may be best. Though this “Dutch Venice” feels quite removed from capital city of Amsterdam, it's only about 75 miles away. And a two-hour journey is well worth the feeling of traveling back in time.",

"Trendy young aristocrats in the 16th century took a whirlwind tour of European cities to visit architectural wonders, admire fine art firsthand, and collect plenty of souvenirs to show off back home. Considered the finale of a classical education, the idea of a Grand Tour–bouncing through cities like London then Paris to Amsterdam and Rome–still informs the places people visit today.During the Grand Tour time–from around 1660–1820–travel was costly and difficult, and accessible only for the privileged. Mostly from the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and North America, the typical Grand Tourist was a young man that recently graduated from university, with proper training in Greek and Latin literature and some interest in the history of art. He had unlimited funds–and a chaperone.Getting away helped young people cut apron strings and build character, explains Rosemary Sweet, professor of Urban History who researches the topic: "The endurance required for early rising, hunger, and long hours in the saddle, ensured that the youth was separated from the comfort and ease of home, where female influence prevailed, and developed the fortitude to withstand personal discomfort and danger with courage and without complaint.”Download design history at the Design Museum; the “Designer Maker User” exhibit displays hundreds of items spanning various disciplines, from fashion to architecture, Vespas to robots.On the arduous journey, top stops included London for starters, then of course Paris. Many visited Amsterdam, while fewer made it to Zurich, Berlin, Athens, or Istanbul. The essential country to visit, however, was Italy, for ancient ruins, fountains, and churches.Few museums existed in Europe before the beginning of the 19th century. Grand Tourists usually checked out paintings and sculptures in private collections, then felt eager to purchase Greco-Roman and Italian art of their own, setting styles at home. Travelers also wrote about their experiences and left a legacy of travel literature and journals.The rite of passage changed greatly with arrival of large-scale rail transport in the 1840s, making once-inaccessible tourism cheaper, easier, and safer. Cities increasingly become better connected. Emerging favorites join the classics, but many of the European destinations explored during those Grand Tours remain the top cities visited today.",
"More than anywhere else I have been, Seville resists change. From its passion for bullfights to its fondness for the pageantry of the Catholic religion, the capital of Andalusia always has reveled in its traditional way of life.The city is at its best in the heat of summer, when the yellows and oranges of its sandstone buildings shimmer yet interiors remain cool, but spring is lovely, too. Be prepared for a Mardi Gras-like crush of people during Semana Santa (Holy Week) and Feria de Abril.The Catedral de Sevilla, the world’s largest Gothic church, is home to one of the largest altarpieces ever made, a masterpiece of meticulously crafted gilded wood. In 2006 DNA tests confirmed that remains in one of the cathedral’s tombs belong to Christopher Columbus. Climb the cathedral’s Giralda bell tower for a view of the city—and use it as a navigational aid while you explore Seville’s winding streets.Opened in 2011, the Metropol Parasol, a structure made largely of laminated birchwood, includes a viewing platform, museum, and eateries. Artists Francisco de Zurbarán and Bartolomé Murillo may not be as famous as Diego Velázquez and Francisco Goya, but their luminous works in Seville’s Museo de Bellas Artes, a jewel of an art gallery housed in a former monastery, just may scramble your rankings of Spanish painters.One of Seville’s most accomplished restaurants, ConTenedor blends informality with creativity; try its signature duck with mushrooms.La Pepona’s array of 80-some wines by the glass is said to be the largest selection in Spain, and its tapas (sardines with tomato compote, seviche) are worthy accompaniments.You would expect a tourist trap in the prime location that is occupied by Vinería San Telmo, but the restaurant/bar proves both authentic and innovative; its thoughtfully prepared tapas are the size of main courses in other places.Eslava, near the Alameda de Hércules, currently sits at the forefront of the new tapas scene with such playful dishes as “fried blood with onions” and “cuttlefish cigars.”While no longer the underappreciated neighborhood eatery it once was, Modesto in Puerta de la Carne still serves up some of the best grilled fish in town out on its tree-shaded patio.The Hotel Palacio de Villapanés has all the traditional touches, including a classic Sevillano courtyard, but offers up-to-date amenities, such as guest-room computers and free Wi-Fi.Small and stylish, the boutique hotel Corral del Rey occupies a 17th-century residence. Perfectly positioned on a tiny street a short walk from the city’s center but out of range of tour buses, it includes such amenities as a rooftop plunge pool.The vivid pages of Iberia, perhaps author James Michener’s most successful nonfiction work, bring Spain, and Seville, to life.Hispanophile Ernest Hemingway documented the 1959 season of bullfights in Seville in his posthumous book, The Dangerous Summer.This piece, reported by Bruce Schoenfeld, first appeared in the February 2015 issue of National Geographic Traveler to accompany a feature he wrote for the magazine entitled “Spanish Inclination.”",
"Whitewashed villages teeter on hilltops throughout the countryside of Andalusia, Spain, but the pueblos blancos share more than beautiful architecture. They were built to defend communities against invaders during centuries of conflict.Today the conflict is past but community remains: A pueblo blanco named Algar recently began a campaign for a local tradition they call charlas al fresco, or “fresh-air chats” to be recognized on the UNESCO World Heritage Intangible List. The honorific recognizes the importance of beliefs, customs, and skills such as dancing, food preparation, and crafts intrinsic to specific cultures and places.“We all bring chairs into the street to spend time with our friends and neighbors. It’s been happening as long as anyone can remember,” says Algar mayor José Carlos Sánchez, who was born and raised in this Andalusian community of just 1,442 people. “It’s a special thing, to see people old and young sitting out in the street together.”That long-running, communal discussion has the power to bridge social and political divides and brings the community together to share news, says the mayor, who launched the UNESCO bid last summer. When the pandemic allowed, residents donned their masks and kept the conversations going.Still, fewer and fewer people are joining in the street-side socializing in the evenings—drawn, instead, to online platforms, says Sánchez. A road trip through Andalusia’s pueblos blancos not only reveals a land once caught between medieval warring kingdoms but also a way of life threatened by rapidly changing social norms.Algar is one of 19 pueblos blancos in this southernmost region of Spain. In the late Middle Ages, these towns formed a contested borderland.To the north were Christian kings, eager to reconquer the Iberian Peninsula. They faced off against the Islamic Emirate of Granada, a Moorish kingdom ruled from the magnificent Alhambra Palace.(Granada, an ancient city of sultans, is a 21st-century wonder.)The emirate surrendered to Christian forces in 1492, but Arabic-speaking Moors left their architectural legacy etched across this landscape. In the Islamic era the villages had likely begun to acquire their distinctive hue, says Eduardo Mosquera Adell, who studies historic architecture at the University of Seville, noting that 14th-century Andalusian-Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun described a method for making whitewash, or cal, from slaked lime.Cal helped keep homes cool through the searing Andalusian summer, Mosquera says, and in time its pristine color also became associated with hygiene. When a series of epidemics from plague to cholera and yellow fever swept through the region between the 16th and 19th centuries, houses were painted with cal in the wake of infection. (It may have actually helped: Studies show that slaked lime does kill bacteria that cause cholera.)Weathering year after year of disease, some of Andalusia’s villages slowly turned the pure white that still shines under southern Spain’s year-round sunshine.Today, the white villages of Andalusia are also a point of cultural pride. Traditional production of Andalusian whitewash was itself given UNESCO status in 2011, and southwest of Seville the Museo de Cal de Morón demonstrates the artisanal process for visitors.“That type of recognition can raise awareness of the community’s shared heritage,” says anthropologist Gema Carrera Díaz, director of the Atlas of the Andalusian Immaterial Heritage. While industrial paint has largely supplanted cal in Andalusia, Carrera says the UNESCO designation helped spur a revival. “It’s really important from an educational perspective.”To see just how spectacular the white villages can be, rent a car and head for the hills. Linked by a tangle of narrow mountain roads, Andalusia’s pueblos blancos invite leisurely road trips that reveal the traditional ways of life that have persevered here.(Find mosaics and mystery in an outpost of the Roman empire.)Start the journey at the northeast corner of the pueblos blancos region, where lines of silver-leafed olive trees march away from the hilltop village of Olvera. From there, a short drive leads to Setenil de las Bodegas, where historic homes were built directly into a series of overhanging cliff faces.The landscape turns wild as the road twists southwest into the Parque Natural Sierra de Grazalema and towards Zahara de la Sierra, a tiny village that makes the most of a spectacular setting atop a rocky promontory. Zigzag over the high pass Puerto de las Palomas to reach Grazalema, a shepherding village famed for aged cheese and warm woolen clothing.After mountain peaks give way to rolling farms, you’ll arrive in Algar—the pretty pueblo blanco where charlas al fresco still last all through the summer night.That custom is not unique to Algar, Carrera cautions. “It’s a tradition that you see in many parts of Andalusia and across the Mediterranean,” she says. “The summers are very warm, so people always went outside to cool off, and cultures here have placed a lot of value in socializing.”Such outdoor mingling dwindled as cars took over city streets, Carrera says, noting that air conditioning and modern technology have also contributed to changing social patterns.But when it comes to preserving heritage, Carrera says, customs don’t need to be singular to be worthy of recognition. It’s more significant that they’re representative, which this one is. And for a village like Algar, even the process of seeking UNESCO status might help sustain a traditional way of life. It can spark conversations about shared values, and which customs must be safeguarded in years to come.“Especially in a moment like this one, in a pandemic, when so much is changing and so many social relations are changing, it can have an important effect on that community,” Carrera says. “They begin to take pride in a practice, which then gains new value.”(Along Hadrian’s Wall, ancient Rome’s temples, towers, and cults come to life.)The Algar mayor’s campaign for UNESCO recognition isn’t just about looking backwards. Sánchez also hopes his efforts will bring fresh energy to a quiet town that few outsiders—even Spaniards from nearby cities—are familiar with. He wants to put the town on the map for friendliness, Sánchez says, insisting that travelers are welcome to join in.For now, the UNESCO bid is pending. The process of recognition can take years. At home in Algar, however, Sánchez has already seen results.“After I launched the UNESCO campaign, I saw a car pull up one summer evening and two strangers got out with a pair of beach chairs,” he says, laughing at the memory. The mayor was thrilled that two outsiders heard about the tradition and came to take part. “Come to Algar for a chat next summer,” Sánchez told me. “You can even bring a beach chair.”",
"Best of the best: That's the lofty standard for making the World Heritage List. Nations lobby hard to get their glorious buildings, wilderness, and historic ruins on the list, a stamp of approval that brings prestige, tourist income, public awareness, and, most important, a commitment to save the irreplaceable.In November 1972 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inaugurated the list by adopting a treaty known as the World Heritage Convention. Its continuing goal is to recruit the world community in identifying cultural and natural properties of "outstanding universal value."UNESCO officials do not see the list as a mere trophy case of superlative places. World Heritage status commits the home nation to protect the designated location. And if a site—through natural disaster, war, pollution, or lack of funds—begins to lose its value, nations that have signed the treaty must assist, if possible, in emergency aid campaigns. As of January 2017, 193 of the world's nations have signed the treaty.On the lush volcanic island of Ra’iatea in the center of the Polynesian Triangle, forested valley, lagoon, and coral reef make up the property of Taputapuātea. In addition to its stunning natural features, the marae complex—a political, ceremonial and funerary center—is evidence of traditional Polynesian worship.Travel tip: Air Tahiti offers 40-minute flights to Ra’iatea from Papeete and Moorea, and daily 15-minute flights from Huahine and Bora Bora. The island can also be reached by ferry, but runs less frequently.The World Heritage program has scored high-profile successes. It exerted pressure to halt a highway near Egypt's Giza Pyramids, block a salt mine at a gray whale nursery in Mexico, and cancel a dam proposal above Africa's Victoria Falls. Its funds, provided by dues from the treaty's signers, have hired park rangers, bought parkland, built visitor centers, and restored temples. It relies on persuasive powers more than legal threats, but over a period of nearly five decades, the World Heritage initiative has quietly become a force for appreciating and safeguarding the world's special places.As of 2018, there were 1,073 properties on the World Heritage list: 832 of cultural significance, 206 of natural significance, and 35 of mixed value. For sites in urgent need of safegaurding, Article 11.4 of the 1972 UNESCO convention established the List of World Heritage in Danger to recognize sites under threat from urban and tourism development, armed conflict, natural disasters, and abandonment. As of 2018, 54 sites are listed in danger.",

"Men dive into a swimming hole at the top of Victoria Falls.Victoria Falls is one the biggest and most awe-inspiring waterfalls on the planet.Spanning the width of the Zambezi River—more than a mile across—this legendary waterfall cascades over the lip of a large plateau of volcanic rock and plunges as much as 354 feet. It generate mists that can be spotted from more than a dozen miles away, which is why locals have dubbed it Mosi-oa-Tunya, or "the smoke that thunders."But while the flow has been slicing slowly through this plateau on the national border between Zambia and Zimbabwe for some two million years, extreme swings in rainfall brought on by climate change threaten its future.Victoria Falls is getting drier and hotter. While the region still sees roughly the same annual rainfall, those rains are compressed into a smaller period of time. Temperatures, too, are rising—in a July 2018 paper, South African researcher Kaitano Dube found that the average daily high temperature in October has warmed 6.8 F (3.8 C) from 1976 to 2017. Last year, the area suffered its worst drought in a century, bringing the falls to a trickle in December.This extreme weather threatens not only the majesty of the falls, but also the health of its ecosystem and the local economy. The Guardian reports that recent droughts have caused power cuts in both countries, which rely on hydropower from the downstream Kariba Dam. (Learn how climate change is contributing to global economic inequities.)The mists of Victoria Falls sustain a rainforest-like ecosystem adjacent to the falls and on the opposite cliff that faces them like a dried-up mirror image, thick with mahogany, fig, palm, and other species of vegetation.While it looks as if these visitors to Victoria Falls are flirting with disaster, swimming in the Devil's Pool is not quite as dangerous as it looks, thanks to an underwater lip. Located on the Zambia side of the falls, the pool is only accessible during the dry season from August to January.The national border between Zambia and Zimbabwe lies midstream, and national parks of both nations exist on either side of the Zambezi. The gorges and cliffs below the falls in these parks are prime territory for raptors, including falcons and black eagles.Humans have long relied on the falls, too. Stone artifacts from the hominin Homo habilis have been identified near the falls and show that early humans may have lived here two million years ago. More "modern" tools also evidence far more recent—50,000 years ago—Middle Stone Age settlements at Victoria Falls.Today, tourism is essential to driving economic growth. Several hundred thousand visitors from around the world trek to the falls each year. Hotels, restaurants, campgrounds, and other tourist businesses have cropped up to cater to them.The beauty of the falls lies in their natural state, but the area is at some risk of runaway tourism-based development—more resorts, hotels, and even a possible dam below the falls that could flood several park gorges. Operators in the area offer everything from helicopter overflights to bungee jumping, and the management of these activities while preserving a quality visitor experience for all is an ongoing challenge.Planning a trip to Victoria Falls? Here’s what you need to know.",
"Victoria Falls is on almost everyone’s bucket list, but few people know the best way to experience it. On a recent trip to southern Africa, I saw it from every which way, so you don’t have to.It’s not the widest or the tallest falls in the world, but it is without doubt the most impressive.Known by locals as Mosi-oa-Tunya, or “the smoke that thunders,” it was first seen by Western eyes in 1855 when British explorer David Livingstone came upon it and named it after his queen. Reflecting on the experience of seeing Victoria Falls for the first time, he wrote, “Scenes so lovely must be gazed upon by angels in their flight.”The cataract still has that power to strike awe. It spans about a mile—the entire width of the Zambezi River—and drops a distance about twice the height of Niagara into a narrow gorge in one seemingly continuous sheet, forcing mist to rise high into the sky.Not only can you see it, but you can hear it (from about a mile away), feel it, smell it, and taste it.The falls straddles Zimbabwe to the west and Zambia to the east. You can access it from either country, via the town of Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe or Livingstone in Zambia. Both have good air connections.Zimbabwe has historically been the more popular entry point, but political turmoil and hyperinflation in the 2000s made Zambia preferable.Zambia has been one of Africa’s most stable and understated democracies; its safari lodges are known for their old-fashioned hospitality and plentiful wildlife.Tip: At the airport of the country you enter first—Zimbabwe or Zambia—make sure you obtain the UniVisa (currently U.S. $50 for nationals from many countries) that serves as a multicountry pass.There are national park entrances on both sides of the falls, easily accessible from the towns of either Livingstone or Victoria Falls.If you’ve booked through a safari operator, your guide will simply drive you to the entrance. The per-person fee is $20 on the Zambia side and $30 on the Zimbabwe side.Put very briefly: To see the falls, go to Zimbabwe; to feel the falls, go to Zambia.But I recommend seeing it from both sides, and here’s why:The Zambia side at high flow (February to June) is an exhilaratingly visceral experience; visitors walking on the other side of the narrow gorge can feel the spray (get drenched or rent a poncho). In the dry season, because the falls are at an incline, portions of land stay dry, which opens up other opportunities (see question on Devil’s Pool, below).The Zimbabwe side tends to offer the more picturesque views because the viewpoints are farther, offering perspective. If you go in the height of the dry season, say, in November, the water volume is at a low point and the falls can feel a little underwhelming.Yes!In fact, I did both sides in a couple of hours. Make sure you have a multiple-country visa in your passport. From either Livingstone or Victoria Falls, visit the border-crossing office and get your passport stamped for exit.You can drive or walk across the bridge between the two countries, get your passport stamped for entry, and walk to the national park entrance.If you wish to return, make sure you get your passport stamped leaving the country and entering the other country.However, I feel compelled to mention that one of the most compelling experiences I had didn’t even require park entrance. I stood on the bridge between the two countries, straddled Zim and Zam, and gazed at the world’s most famous waterfall.There were a few other Western tourists, but I was mostly joined by the cross-border drivers and migrant workers. Safety during the day on the border road isn’t much of a concern, though travelers do have to deal with polite but pesky trinket sellers.A luxury dinner train crosses from Zambia to Zimbabwe over the Zambezi River and stops in the middle for a view of the Falls (though plans call for an additional departure in the other direction).For an aerial view, microlight flights are popular, and so is bungee jumping. There are comfortable or luxury lodges near both towns, often the launching points of multiday wildlife safaris.Devil’s Pool is an experience you can have only on the Zambia side and only during the dry season (mid-August to mid-January). It involves a boat ride on the Zambezi to Livingstone Island, from which you can swim in a natural pool at the edge of the falls.Breathe easy: An unseen lip prevents you from actually going over. Run by a well-regarded tour operator, the Devils Pool is not a dangerous activity—provided you follow the directions of the guides. There are other unofficial natural pools in which people have gone over the edge; make sure your outfitter is licensed.Norie Quintos is an editor at large at National Geographic Traveler.

"Shakespeare's play Othello features a Moorish general in the Venetian army. The 19th-century African-American actor Ira Aldridge, depicted here in the title role, was the first black man to appear in a Shakespeare performance in Britain.If the term “Moor” seems familiar but confusing, there’s a reason: Though the term can be found throughout literature, art, and history books, it does not actually describe a specific ethnicity or race. Instead, the concept of Moors has been used to describe alternatively the reign of Muslims in Spain, Europeans of African descent, and others for centuries.Derived from the Latin word “Maurus,” the term was originally used to describe Berbers and other people from the ancient Roman province of Mauretania in what is now North Africa. Over time, it was increasingly applied to Muslims living in Europe. Beginning in the Renaissance, “Moor” and “blackamoor” were also used to describe any person with dark skin.In A.D. 711, a group of North African Muslims led by the Berber general, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, captured the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). Known as al-Andalus, the territory became a prosperous cultural and economic center where education and the arts and sciences flourished.Over time, the strength of the Muslim state diminished, creating inroads for Christians who resented Moorish rule. For centuries, Christian groups challenged Muslim territorial dominance in al-Andalus and slowly expanded their territory. This culminated in 1492, when Catholic monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I won the Granada War and completed Spain’s conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Eventually, the Moors were expelled from Spain.The Alhambra, a Moorish palace and fortress in Granada, Spain, was described by poets as a "pearl set in emeralds."By then, the idea of Moors had spread across Western Europe. “Moor” came to mean anyone who was Muslim or had dark skin; occasionally, Europeans would distinguish between “blackamoors” and “white Moors.”One of the most famous mentions of Moors is in Shakespeare’s play The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice. Its titular character is a Moor who serves as a general in the Venetian army. (In Shakespeare’s time, the port city of Venice was ethnically diverse, and the Moors represented a growing interchange between Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.) Despite his military prowess, Othello is also portrayed as exotic, hypersexual, and untrustworthy—“a lascivious Moor” who secretly marries a white woman—reflecting historic stereotypes of black people.More recently, the term has been coopted by the sovereign citizen movement in the United States. Members of Moorish sovereign citizen groups claim they are descended from Moors who predated white settlers in North America, and that they are part of a sovereign nation and not subject to U.S. laws. It’s proof of the ongoing allure of “Moor” as a seemingly legitimate ethnic designation—even though its meaning has never been clear.",
"Isabella of Castile should never have been queen. Born on April 22, 1451, she was the second child of King John II of Castile. The king already had an heir, Henry, a 26-year-old son from his first marriage, making him Isabella’s half brother. The king’s second wife, Isabella of Portugal, would deliver a son, Alfonso, two years later, making Isabella third in line.Her sex and her birth order should have kept her from the throne, but Isabella was a woman who defied the odds. Tough, determined, and iron-willed, Queen Isabella of Castile deftly maneuvered dynastic feuds and political rivalries. Together with her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon, she politically and religiously united Spain, routed the last Muslim stronghold in western Europe, and launched the age of exploration by backing Christopher Columbus. His voyages would lay the foundation for what would become the Spanish Empire. At the height of her power, one European observed, “This queen of Spain, called Isabella, has had no equal on this earth for 500 years.” (See also: Should women rule the world? Queens of ancient Egypt say yes.)When Isabella was born, Spain was not united. Instead, it was fractured into several small kingdoms. Her father, John II, ruled Castile. Meaning “land of castles,” Castile had once been a small Christian power in northern Spain in the 10th century. As the centuries passed, it grew larger, gradually expanding south as Spain’s Muslim rulers, the “Moors,” were weakening.Iberia’s other Christian kingdoms were Aragon to the east, Navarre to the north, and Portugal to the west. These three other territories had their own royal families, who were deeply interrelated and constantly quarrelling over questions of succession. In negotiating these disputes, Isabella would prove to be as cunning as her older brother Henry was inept. (See also: Meet the 'difficult' women who wrote their own rules.)John II died in 1454, and Henry became king of Castile, ruling from the city of Segovia. He sent Isabella, her brother Alfonso, and their mother far away from court to Arévalo. Isabella was nevertheless given an education fit for a princess, and she was surrounded by a select group of ladies-in-waiting and tutors appointed by her father before he died. From them she received a substantial education of rhetoric, painting, philosophy, and history.Struggling as king, Henry was unable to provide an heir. His childless first marriage was annulled, but not without having had his sexual prowess (or lack thereof) exposed before an ecclesiastic tribunal. His inability to plant the royal seed became a vexing political issue, giving him the moniker that would accompany him into history books: Henry the Impotent.Henry married again in 1455, this time to the daughter of the king of Portugal. In 1462 she gave birth to a daughter, Joanna, but rumors about the girl’s true paternity began to swirl. Some believed that Henry was not her biological father, and that the likeliest candidate was one of the king’s—and possibly the queen’s—favorites. Whether true or not, the courtly gossip only further undermined both Joanna’s legitimacy and Henry’s power.Shortly before Joanna’s birth, Henry summoned Isabella and Alfonso to Segovia to have more supervision and control over possible rivals to the throne. Their mother remained in Arévalo; Isabella would later describe how she was “inhumanely . . . torn from our mother’s arms.” She hated living at court and considered Henry’s wife to be cruel and abusive.Painters were often charged with creating portraits of kings and queens to show them at their best. These works tended to be idealized, depicting the monarchs as dashing heroes or great beauties. Isabella’s court artist, John of Flanders (also known as Juan de Flandes), chose to emphasize different qualities in his subjects. His portraits of the queen downplay Isabella’s golden hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. As shown in the painting above, John of Flanders depicts her as well-dressed and austere. Her hair is arranged simply, and her expression is calm and steady. Isabella and the artist have forgone beauty to call out the qualities of a strong 15th-century leader: regality, piety, and reserve.Henry officially named his infant daughter Joanna heir to the throne of Castile. A powerful group of nobles used the rumors of Joanna’s parentage to protest it. They backed Alfonso over Joanna as the true heir. In a risky move Isabella sided with her younger brother. Her daring paid off, for Henry relented; he named Alfonso his heir as long as Joanna were betrothed to him so that both would share the crown.But Henry would later attempt to back out of this arrangement, and civil war erupted. The rebels crowned the young Alfonso king, but his “rule” never gained legitimacy. He died three years later, in 1468, and left Isabella as his heir. Some of the kingdom’s barons were more than willing to rally around Isabella’s claim.Her more impetuous advisers urged Isabella to seize power without waiting for Henry to die. But the princess, though still a teenager, demonstrated keen political savvy. Presenting herself as a guarantor of the established order, she would quietly wait her turn while negotiating a stronger position for herself. Patience paid off; Henry signed an agreement in 1468 in which he recognized his half sister as his legitimate successor. As part of the deal, she would not have to marry against her will, a distinct improvement over tradition. Isabella had the position she sought on her terms and would become queen after her older brother’s death.Isabella knew when to be patient and when to make a bold move, skills that served her well as she carefully navigated choosing a husband. Few detailed descriptions of the young Isabella exist, but chroniclers agree she had fair skin, blue eyes, and dark blonde hair, inherited from her English grandmother, Catherine of Lancaster. Isabella was sure to be courted, if not for her looks, then for her lands and her title.As part of being Henry’s heir, Isabella agreed to inform the king of any marriage proposals before a match was made. Marriage in the 15th century was a political tool, creating alliances between kingdoms. Henry and his backers wanted Isabella to marry King Afonso V of Portugal to unite the two kingdoms. Afonso was a widower and nearly 20 years older than Isabella. Rather than blindly submit to her brother’s wishes, Isabella quietly decided to consider other suitors, ones more to her liking.One of the leading candidates was Ferdinand, son of John II of Aragon. He was just a year younger than Isabella. In 1461 his father named Ferdinand heir to Aragon and the other lands under his control. Battle-tested Ferdinand appealed to Isabella. It would be smart to ally with Aragon, she decided, which was keen to unite with Castile to form a vast kingdom in Iberia. Throughout 1468 Isabella continued to be coy toward the Portuguese overtures, never outright rejecting marriage to its king, while she secretly entertained envoys from Aragon and discussed different marriage possibilities. By January 1469 she had made her choice, and it was Ferdinand.Some historians have claimed that Isabella fell for Ferdinand’s dashing reputation, that his youth and machismo tipped the scales. While this is a romantic story, it is more likely that Isabella was following her head and not her heart when she chose her mate. She suspected that once married to Afonso V, she would be forced to forfeit her power and become little more than a consort. With Ferdinand, she could craft a better deal to maintain her power even though she would be openly rebelling against her brother.Marriage preparations were carried out in the utmost secrecy. According to their negotiations, Ferdinand could administer justice in Castile, but Isabella would retain power as queen over every other domain. Ferdinand could not even leave Castile without her permission. The engagement remained secret, but Isabella had to make a public demonstration of her loyalty to Aragon to seal the deal. She did so by leaving Ocaña, the town where Henry had placed her under the careful watch of his supporters. Without her brother’s consent, she traveled to Madrigal de las Altas Torres, her birthplace, and from there to Valladolid in northern Castile, where the pair would marry.In September 1469 Ferdinand set out from Aragon to join Isabella. Disguised as a servant, he rode in a small party of six to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Two days after Ferdinand’s arrival, the couple met for the very first time. Four days later, Isabella and Ferdinand were wed. The marriage was duly consummated on the following day, in a nuptial chamber shared with a select group of witnesses. Official chroniclers presented their meeting as love at first sight, but both partners had a shared political interest in the marriage and practical reasons for making it work.Many of Spain’s noble families were closely related, which had led to power struggles in the past. In this case, Ferdinand and Isabella were second cousins. According to canon law, they required papal authorization to get married. Concerned by the consequences the marriage could have for the territories of Castile and Aragon, Pope Paul II refused to grant it. (See also: This Renaissance warrior woman defied powerful popes to defend her lands.)In Isabella's time, the Spanish people associated masculinity with authority and power, a custom that shaped Isabella's life from the start. On announcing her birth, her father proclaimed that he was father to “a princely daughter.” When Isabella became queen, her propaganda touted her qualities of strength, stoicism, and toughness. “She is strong, more than the strongest man,” the Italian courtier and scholar Pietro Martire d’Anghiera said of her. Another chronicler, Lucio Marineo Siculo, wrote, “according to the ladies who served her . . . they never saw her complain about pain, even the pain of childbirth.”When the wedding took place in October 1469, the archbishop of Toledo had presented a forged papal bull, of which the couple were no doubt aware. They repeatedly requested dispensation from Rome but did not obtain it until December. So the woman who ended up receiving the title of “Catholic Queen,” in fact married in defiance of church law. By the time she was pardoned, she had already given birth to her first child—a daughter, also named Isabella—in 1470.Henry ­­was furious when he received news of the marriage. He rightly regarded Isabella as having infringed their pact and immediately decided to cancel her right of succession and return it to his daughter, Joanna. Isabella was not surprised by his reaction and might have even welcomed it. She never forgave Henry for cruelly separating her from her mother all those years ago; however, she did not directly challenge her brother for the throne while he lived. Instead, Isabella kept a cool head and bided her time.One freezing December morning in 1474, news of Henry’s death reached Isabella and Ferdinand. The following day Isabella solemnly proclaimed herself queen of Castile and demanded obedience from the main cities of the kingdom. Weeks later Joanna also proclaimed herself queen. She forged an alliance with Portugal by agreeing to marry her uncle (and Isabella’s former suitor), King Afonso V.Isabella would spend the first four years of her reign fighting a bloody civil war against Joanna and Portugal for the Castilian throne. It was during this conflict that her marriage to Ferdinand began to change. When they were engaged, Isabella held the political power, but war would place the couple on more even ground. With a common goal to unite them, they needed to trust in the other’s loyalty and skills as each traveled separately to build armies and forge alliances. Over time the marriage strengthened and grew into one of mutual respect.This partnership served them well, and by 1479 the two had defeated Joanna and Afonso. Isabella’s grip on the throne of Castile was now secure. The victorious queen gave her niece a choice: be pledged to marry Isabella’s one-year-old son John, or enter a convent in Portugal. Joanna chose the nunnery. When Ferdinand’s father died later that year, Ferdinand became king of Aragon. The two kingdoms would be united, laying the groundwork for a united Spain in years to come.Isabella’s rise to power set the stage for a dramatic era in Spanish history, filled with turbulent highs and lows. She and Ferdinand completed the Reconquista, the centuries-long movement to end Muslim rule in Iberia. Granada, the last Muslim stronghold, fell in January 1492, and Iberia returned to full Christian control. Later that year in October, Isabella’s decision to back Christopher Columbus unexpectedly paid off when he made landfall in the Caribbean. This expedition would lay the foundations for the Spanish Empire in the New World, making Spain a dominant player on the world stage. (See the 500-year-old map used by Columbus.)Isabella’s reign had its darker side too. The Spanish Inquisition began under her rule around 1480, persecuting Muslims and Jews who would not convert to Catholicism. In 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand ordered Spain’s Jewish community to convert or be expelled. The Catholic Monarchs ventured down a dark path to unity through the terror and pain of others, a move that still casts dark shadows over Spanish history.After 35 years of marriage, the union of Isabella and Ferdinand came to an end in 1504. Isabella died at the age of 52. Ferdinand mourned the loss, calling her “the best and most excellent wife a king ever had.” Pious and devout, she asked in her will to be buried “in a low tomb with no structure other than a low slab on the floor,” but her wishes were defied. Her tomb is suited to a queen of her stature, and Ferdinand would join her there 11 years later.",
"Toward the end of 1499, a woman stood atop the walls of the Rocca di Ravaldino in Forlì, some 185 miles north of Rome. The troops of the Borgias, a powerful rival family, were holding her children hostage and threatening to kill them if she did not yield the fortress and her lands to them. But she refused, raised her skirts, and cried: “Kill them if you will, I have the means to make many more! You will never make me surrender."The tale may be apocryphal but, given what is known about the extraordinary Caterina Sforza, it has a ring of truth. One of the most exceptional figures of the Italian Renaissance, Sforza rubbed shoulders with the artistic and cultural geniuses of her era. She defied convention, studied alchemy, and welcomed confrontation with the Borgias and other powerful families. (Read more about the most famous Borgia, Lucrezia.)Caterina was born in 1463 in Milan, an illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, who, later in her childhood, would become Duke of Milan. Despite her illegitimacy, she was brought up at the center of her father’s household, where she received an education imbued with the humanist spirit of the age. Like other girls in this remarkable family, she studied military tactics and weaponry alongside boys. (Read about humanism in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel art.)In 1473, when Caterina was 10, her family made a political alliance and betrothed her to Girolamo Riario, a man 20 years her senior and nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. Lord of Imola and Forlì—a city south of Milan in Romagna—Girolamo took his child bride to live in Rome after she turned 14. The move helped consolidate their place at the center of the papal court. Caterina would give birth to several children and become a powerful intermediary between Rome and Milan.In August 1484 Pope Sixtus IV’s death caused political chaos as Italy’s families jockeyed to put one of their own on the throne of St. Peter. (Learn the meanings of different colored smoke in choosing a new pope today.)Caterina's husband was in a precarious position: Many factions seeking to seize his lands after his uncle's death. Riario had been away from Rome, campaigning against these rival factions, but now he was prevented from returning to the city to shore up his position. Caterina, despite being seven months pregnant, did it for him.She commanded her forces to seize Rome’s Castel Sant’Angelo. She refused to cede it, claiming that Pope Sixtus had bestowed control of it to her family before his death. The only person she would hand it over to would be the next pope. Knowing the cardinals feared her artillery, Caterina seized the castle to buy some time for her husband to strike a deal. Caterina and Riaro left Rome only after securing 8,000 ducats in compensation and recognition of their estates in Imola and Forlì, as well as Riaro's appointment as captain-general of the Vatican troops.Photographed here in 1957, the Castel Sant’Angelo originally housed the remains of Roman emperors before it was converted into a fortress by the Catholic church.Caterina had the chance to prove her political skills at her new home in Forlì. After Riaro was murdered in 1488 by supporters of the new pope, Innocent VIII, she acted as regent for her oldest son Ottaviano, who was not yet of age. She shrewdly lowered taxes to win the alliegience of her citizens. She formed strong alliances with neighboring states through marriages to her children. She also took command of her army’s military training.A few months after her husband’s death, Caterina secretly married Giacomo Feo with whom she had a son, Bernardino Carlo. The passion she felt for the ambitious young man proved to be a weakness. She removed her eldest son, Ottaviano, from power and gave control of the state over to her husband. She also put Feo’s relatives in charge of the fortresses defending the city. Ottaviano’s supporters did not approve and hatched a successful plot to murder Caterina’s second husband in 1495. Unbowed and unbroken, the widow had his assassins and their families massacred in retaliation.Shown here in a 1545 portrait, Giovanni, the son of Caterina and Giovanni de' Medici, later became a famous military leader.In 1497, at age 34, Caterina obtained permission from her uncle, Duke Ludovico Sforza, to marry Giovanni de’ Medici, a member of the powerful Florentine family. She had met him a year earlier when he came to Forlì as an ambassador from Florence. Once again, the marriage would end in death, and she would be widowed: Barely a year after Caterina gave birth to a son, Giovanni (later known as Giovanni delle Bande Nere, a famous military commander), Medici died of pneumonia in the middle of a conflict between Florence and Venice.Shortly afterward, Pope Alexander VI, a Borgia, set out to enlarge the Papal States by absorbing cities in Romagna, including Caterina's lands in Forlì and Imola. Caterina Sforza immediately began expanding her military defenses, improving her weaponry, and creating large stores of food and ammunition in case she was besieged. Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois, stood opposed to Caterina who had taken up residency at the fortress of nearby Ravaldino, the Rocca di Ravaldino.Son of Pope Alexander, Cesare Borgia was a powerful enemy with major forces at his command. After Imola and Forlì fell, Borgia set about besieging the Rocca di Ravaldino on December 19, 1499. Caterina personally commanded the defense with the aid of more than 1,000 soldiers. She refused one peace offer after another, even—as the legend says—at the cost of her children’s lives.This oil painting of Cesare Borgia, Caterina's enemy, was painting by Altobello Melone around 1513.On January 12, 1500, after a hard-fought defense, Borgia’s troops took Ravaldino, and captured Caterina. Although she asked to be placed in the custody of the King of France, Louis XII, Borgia did not relinquish his prisoner and held her for two years.It was not long, however, before Borgia did send her to Rome, where Caterina was held by Pope Alexander in Belvedere, a beautiful villa near the city. The Borgia pope insisted on treating his prisoner as an honored guest, in accordance with her rank, but all the attention he lavished on her failed to quash Sforza’s rebellious spirit. After an unsuccessful escape attempt, the troublesome duchess was sent to Castel Sant’Angelo, the fortress she had seized years earlier.After the King of France interceded on her behalf, Caterina was released in 1501 and retired to a family villa in Florence. It was there, following the death of Pope Alexander VI, that she attempted to reclaim her lands from the new pontiff, one of the great art patrons of the Renaissance, Pope Julius II. However, both the cities of Forlì and Imola objected to her return, and so she passed into the hands of a Vatican nobleman called Antonio Maria Ordelaffi.Caterina spent the last few years of her life with her children, continuing her lifelong study of alchemy. In May 1509, when she was just 46 years old, she died of pneumonia. She was buried in the Convent of Santa Maria delle Murate, in an anonymous tomb, as stipulated in her will. Her grandson, Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, later ordered a white marble gravestone be placed over her grave. In 1835 that stone was destroyed when the convent’s flooring was renovated. Caterina, it seems, would not be contradicted—even in death.1463 Caterina Sforza is born, the illegitimate daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, future Duke of Milan, and his lover, Lucrezia Landriani.1484 Caterina defends the interests of her husband Girolamo Riario in Rome following the death of Pope Sixtus IV.1488 Girolamo is assassinated, and Caterina marries again.

"The Economist reports from this year’s AAAS meeting about a fascinating lecture delivered by the historian of science Lawrence Principe about his quest to figure out the real history of alchemy. Principe has done some impressive work to brush away the Whig history of modern chemistry and understand alchemy on its own terms.Alchemy is saddled with such a bad reputation that many people don’t appreciate  how it played an important role in the birth of modern sciences, such as biochemistry and neurology.Here’s part of a blog post I wrote in 2006 on this surprising link:Jan Baptist van Helmont, a sixteenth-century Belgian alchemist, carried out a classic experiment on biological growth. He put a five pound willow sapling in a tube of 200 pounds of earth. For five years he gave the tree nothing but water, and then weighed both tree and earth. The tree had grown to 169 pounds, while the earth had lost a few ounces. “Hence one hundred and sixty-four pounds of wood, bark, and roots have come up from water alone,” he announced. Van Helmont believed that the willow was nothing more than transmuted water, given form by the willow’s inner soul.I first came to appreciate the importance of alchemy in the rise of biochemistry while working on my book Soul Made Flesh, on the history of neurology. Thomas Willis, the first neurologist, started out as an alchemist, deeply influenced by Van Helmont. He came into contact with Robert Boyle through their shared interest in alchemy. And his first important work was a book that used alchemy to reinterpret physiology. Instead of the four humours, Willis saw body being made up of corpuscles of different sorts, borrowing concepts of Van Helmont and other alchemists. These corpuscles interacted with one another to produce changes, just as ferments made bread rise and grape juice turn to wine.Willis later did groundbreaking work on the anatomy and function of the brain, which until his time had generally been considered a pretty useless organ. Willis envisioned the brain as an alembic, the distilling container of alchemy, in which some of the corpuscles of the blood were distilled into the animal spirits, which then flowed through the nerves. While some of Willis’s language and concepts are now hopelessly old-fashioned, he set the study of the brain–and thus the soul–on a new foundation.The intersection of alchemy and biology is just further evidence that science does not advance by simply wiping the slate clean and starting completely from scratch. Some of the most dramatic revolutions were born within systems of thought that today seem hopelessly backwards. I wonder how twenty-ninth cenutry historians will look back at our own revolutions today. Who will be cast aside as the new alchemists?",
"On a spring day in 1480, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia ordered various astrologers to his home in Rome to tell him the future of a newborn child. Named Lucrezia, the baby girl was the daughter of Vannozza Cattanei, a Roman woman noted for her beauty. Nobody believed for one moment, however, that the child’s father was Vannozza’s husband, as Vannozza had been Borgia’s favorite mistress for many years. To the cardinal’s delight, the astrologers foretold a remarkable future for his illegitimate daughter. If their exact predictions came true, the world does not know, but Lucrezia did grow up to become one of the most infamous members of the powerful Borgia clan.Throughout her short life, Lucrezia Borgia was considered beautiful. In her early 20s, a courtier described her as “of middle height and graceful of form; her face is rather long, as is her nose, her hair golden, her eyes of no particular color, her mouth is rather large, the teeth brilliantly white, the bust admirably proportioned. Her whole being exudes gaiety and humor.”Celebrated in a play by the French writer Victor Hugo, a major opera by Donizetti, and the inspiration for many movies, Lucrezia’s life has long fascinated storytellers, who have depicted her as a femme fatale—a seductive woman who poisoned those whom she could not manipulate and who attended orgies and had incestuous relations with members of her family. Most of these characterizations have little or no basis in fact, and many historians now see Lucrezia as a victim of her own family’s machinations for power. Her life serves as a vivid insight into the torrid world of papal politics at the height of the Italian Renaissance and during the tumultuous years leading up to the Protestant Reformation.1480—Lucrezia Borgia is born near Rome, the illegitimate daughter of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia—the future Pope Alexander VI—and his lover, Vannozza Cattanei.1493—The marriage of Lucrezia to Giovanni Sforza, nephew of Ludovico, Duke of Milan, provides the Borgias with a powerful ally in northern Italy.1494—France’s Charles VIII allies with the Duke of Milan against the Borgias, who then plot to kill Lucrezia’s husband. Three years later, their marriage is annulled.1498—After years of being cloistered in a convent, Lucrezia marries Alfonso of Aragon, son of the king of Naples, briefly an ally of the Borgias.1500—Alfonso is attacked. Lucrezia cares for him, but one month later he is found strangled, on the orders—it is rumored—of Lucrezia’s brother, Cesare.1501—A new marriage is arranged between Lucrezia and Alfonso d’Este, heir to the Duke of Ferrara, in whose court Lucrezia will enjoy a degree of autonomy.1519—After nearly two decades of life at the center of the refined Ferrara court, Lucrezia Borgia dies at age 39.Ambitious and worldly, the Borgias originated in Spain and were viewed with alarm and envy by native Italian families. Ascending to the papal throne earlier in the century, Pope Calixtus III was a Borgia. During Lucrezia’s infancy, her father continued to maneuver politically to promote the family’s interests.Having spent her early years living with her mother, Lucrezia was later transferred by her father to the house of his cousin, Adriana Orsini, who taught Lucrezia the foundation of high culture: Latin, Greek, Italian, and French, as well as music, singing, and drawing, enabling her to move with ease in the highest court circles. Orsini’s approach to education was unequivocal: “Above all be sure you have something to say, and then express yourself with simplicity and frankness, avoiding affected words. I want you to learn how to think, not how to produce brilliant sentences.” This education would set her in good stead for a life that was soon to be turned upside down.In August 1492, Rome appointed its second Borgia pontiff, when Rodrigo became Pope Alexander VI. Her father’s accession changed Lucrezia’s life forever. From then on, her fate took on greater importance to the powerful men around her. Because Alexander was pope, his young daughter’s marriage prospects soon became the focus of immense interest in the upper echelons of Roman society. A year later, in 1493, Andrea Boccaccio, the Duke of Ferrara’s ambassador to Rome, described the 13-year-old Lucrezia as an exquisite, graceful young thing, whose education had been “full of Christian piety.”All through her life, Lucrezia’s bearing inspired those who met her, most enduringly the painter Bernardino di Betto—better known as Il Pinturicchio—who used Lucrezia, then 12 years old, as a model for his depiction of Saint Catherine (above) in the frescoes he painted for the Borgia Apartments in the Vatican in 1492. In the section “St. Catherine’s Disputation,” Lucrezia embodies the fourth-century saint, deep in discussion with the Emperor Maximus and 50 pagan philosophers. She stands at the center of the scene, golden hair framing her clear, white complexion, with a bearing both solemn and courtly. The story goes that Saint Catherine defended her arguments with wisdom and eloquence against the pagans who surrounded her. Perhaps Lucrezia drew on the saint’s guidance when, in December 1497, when she was 17, she attended the ruling at the Vatican annulling her marriage to Giovanni Sforza. According to an ambassador, Lucrezia made a speech afterward in Latin “with such elegance and gentility that not even Cicero could have spoken with more precision and grace.”The leading families in Italy were all keen to connect their fortunes with those of the powerful Pope Alexander, and many sought to strike an alliance. Cardinal Ascanio Sforza pointed out: “There are many who long to marry into the pope’s family via his daughter and he lets many think they have a chance. Even the king of Naples aspires to win her hand!”No family, however, was better placed to put forward a suitor than that of the man who had played a decisive role in the election of Pope Alexander: Cardinal Sforza himself, whose brother was the powerful Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza. Cardinal Sforza proposed uniting their house by marrying 13-year-old Lucrezia to his nephew, Giovanni. The offer was accepted by the Borgias, who thereby gained a powerful ally in the north and center of Italy.On June 9, 1493, Giovanni Sforza made his triumphal entrance into Rome through the Porta del Popolo, and three days later his marriage to Lucrezia took place. The city’s elite families, ambassadors, and other officials were invited to attend the ceremony. Accounts describe how the pope and the cardinals ate and danced all night long at the wedding reception. Then in the early hours, the pontiff accompanied the newlyweds to the palace of Santa Maria in Portico. The hopes and fears of Lucrezia, little more than a child herself, were of little consideration to the players involved. The young couple were barely allowed the briefest of domestic interludes before a political storm engulfed them.Early in 1494, the troops of King Charles VIII of France invaded Italy. Ludovico Sforza, uncle of Lucrezia’s husband, forged an alliance with the French against Lucrezia’s father. Trapped in Rome, Giovanni was in an impossible position—caught between the loyalties to his uncle on the one side and to his wife and the mighty Borgias on the other. In the end, he refused to turn against his uncle by supporting Lucrezia’s brothers, Juan and Cesare. After this decision, Cesare explained to Lucrezia that her husband would have to be killed.Allegedly warned by Lucrezia of the plan, Giovanni fled to Milan disguised as a beggar. The Borgias then began the long process of trying to annul the marriage on the grounds that Giovanni was impotent and had never consummated the marriage. These whispers marked the beginning of centuries of lurid speculation about Lucrezia’s sex life, including rumors—spread by Giovanni himself—that Lucrezia had sexual relations with her own father and brother. Giovanni fought the annulment until Pope Alexander agreed to let him keep Lucrezia’s dowry in exchange for ending the marriage. After a public proclamation that her virginity was intact, Lucrezia officially became a single woman again in 1497.During the annulment negotiations, Lucrezia retired to the convent of San Sisto in Rome. Even the cloister could not shield her from the exploits and misfortunes of her scheming family. In 1497, Lucrezia lost her brother Juan, who was found murdered in the Tiber. Meanwhile, her other brother, Cesare—who had been made a cardinal in his late teens by his father—was enjoying a meteoric rise to power, having recently been appointed military chief of the Papal States, the area of central Italy around Rome under direct papal control.Lucrezia’s seclusion at San Sisto ended when the family, as ever pursuing its own interests, started to hunt for a new husband. This time, the suitor was Alfonso of Aragon, the illegitimate son of the king of Naples, the large kingdom that occupied southern Italy. His marriage with Lucrezia would smooth the way to the union of her brother Cesare with Carlotta, daughter of the Neapolitan monarch, who was a key adversary of the pope’s principal enemy, France.In 1498, Lucrezia married her second husband in the Vatican. This time, the wedding seemed to have been genuinely desired by both the bride and groom. Lucrezia was 18, and her slightly younger consort Alfonso was considered both handsome and well educated. The union appeared a happy one, and Lucrezia gave birth to a son, named Rodrigo after his grandfather, in 1499. But the conjugal happiness was short-lived. Dynastic maneuverings soon poisoned the young couple’s prospects.The pope’s negotiations to wed his son Cesare to Carlotta of Naples fell through. In a startling change of heart, he decided to throw in his lot with his erstwhile enemy, the new king of France, Louis XII. In 1500 Cesare married Charlotte d’Albret, daughter of the Duke of Albret and relative of the French monarch. The interests of the Borgias and those of France had now aligned in direct opposition to those of Naples. This meant that Lucrezia’s husband, Alfonso, as a Neapolitan, had become a political liability for the powerful Cesare and Pope Alexander.In the days running up to the jubilee year of 1500, an astrologer warned Alexander that he should take particular care, as misfortune was destined to befall him. In June of that year, the blow fell. The pope was holding a meeting when a gust of wind knocked down the chimney above him. Three people died, and the pope, seated on the papal throne, was injured. Two weeks later on July 15, while Lucrezia was tending to her wounded father, her young husband and his entourage were attacked by a large group of knife-wielding henchmen on the steps of the Vatican. Seriously wounded, Alfonso was taken to recover in quarters within the Vatican itself.For the second time in her short life, Lucrezia rallied to the aid of a husband. She decided to nurse him herself, personally taking on the task of preparing his food and giving orders for trusted doctors to be brought from Naples. Still not fully recovered, Pope Alexander ordered a dozen men to stand guard over Alfonso’s quarters. But rumors of a plot against him had begun to spread through the streets of Rome. The Florentine ambassador was in no doubt the ambush had been ordered from the highest level: “In this palace there is so much hatred, old and new, so much envy and jealousy ... that scandal is inevitable.”Sensational rumors spread. Pamphlets produced in Naples recounted how Cesare, while visiting the convalescing Alfonso, whispered in his ear: “What didn’t happen at lunch could still happen at dinner.” A month later on August 18, Alfonso was strangled in his bed. By all accounts, Lucrezia was heartbroken.A WOMAN AMONG CARDINALSThe presence of Lucrezia in the Vatican scandalized the clergy and the many enemies of Pope Alexander VI. One chronicler of the period vented his indignation that Lucrezia and her ladies-in-waiting were allowed into Saint Peter’s Basilica. It was said that when the pope went away he left his daughter in charge of official duties. Others went further, claiming that she attended wild parties and even orgies.A MAN-EATERLucrezia’s history of relationships with men was indisputably colorful, beginning with the Spanish suitors who bid for her hand when she was barely a teenager. Her three marriages—and the violence and intrigue associated with the first two—stoked the myth of Lucrezia as a lust-crazed murderess. In reality, she was more of a passive pawn in the hands of her ambitious male relatives.AN INCESTUOUS UNIONThe most serious allegation leveled at Lucrezia Borgia was that of having committed incest with her brother Cesare, and with her father, Pope Alexander VI. This accusation was undoubtedly nothing more than a malicious lie, elaborated by her first husband Giovanni Sforza, who argued that the pope had annulled his marriage to Lucrezia “to have the freedom to enjoy himself with his own daughter.”A SECRET SONIn 1498 a rumor spread that the pope’s daughter had an illegitimate son. Some years later, the pope issued two contradictory papal bulls: the first named Cesare as the father, and the second, himself—a confusion that only fueled rumors of Borgia incest. Some historians believe the child was the issue of Lucrezia’s affair with a Spanish servant. Others argue the child was the son of the pope and a Roman woman.DEADLY RUMORSAlthough the Borgias were no saints, the majority of the lurid tales told about them were invented by their many enemies. Later in her life, at the court of Ferrara, Lucrezia was regarded as the model of good breeding. It was only later that she took a role in the increasingly fantastical set of myths about the Borgias, many centering on her use of poison and other fanciful execution methods to murder her husbands and other rivals. Lucrezia resorted to such brutality, the rumors went, to maintain her crazed grip on power—a ludicrous notion, unsupported by any evidence, but which has proved enduring. Victor Hugo, author of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, did much to popularize this image with his 1833 play Lucrezia Borgia, in which the pope’s daughter ponders the various ways she will dispatch her rivals: by hanging, strangling, or poisoning a communion wafer. Based on Hugo’s play, Gaetano Donizetti’s 1833 opera of the same name also portrayed Lucrezia as a murderer, a libel that spread to 19th-century artistic representations of her, such as the picture (above) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, depicting Lucrezia having just poisoned her husband.Devastated by the loss of her husband, Lucrezia retired to the city of Nepi, north of Rome. There she went into deep mourning, signing letters to her father and brother as La Infelicissima—the Extremely Unhappy One. But the two men had little regard for the 20-year-old widow and were soon in search of a third husband who would again satisfy the family’s strategic interests.Between them, Alexander and Cesare came up with Alfonso d’Este. He seemed the perfect candidate: A 24-year-old widower without children, he was heir to the Duke of Ferrara and offered a very attractive alliance for the Borgias. His family seat was in the strategically vital Romagna in northern Italy, and the family had strong links with France.In response to news of the impending marriage, the cannons of the Castel Sant’ Angelo and all the bells in Rome sounded. Soon after, the Duke of Ferrara’s delegation arrived in Rome and sent back reports to the duke reassuring him about the credentials of his son’s Roman bride, whose reputation had become somewhat tainted by the widely publicized exploits of her family. One of the ambassadors reported: “She is a wise lady, and it is not only my opinion, but that of the whole company.”The pair were married in December 1501, and in January 1502, Lucrezia finally left Rome for Ferrara to join her new husband. Her father reminded her that his interests were above her happiness: “You will do more for me from afar, than you could have done remaining here.” In a letter to her father two months after leaving, Lucrezia writes: “I consider your Lordship my most precious possession in this world.”Out of reach of her powerful family, Lucrezia was at last able to enjoy some autonomy. Far away from Rome in northern Italy, she brought together some of the most glittering talents of the Renaissance in the court of Ferrara. She seemed to rise above the misfortune into which the rest of the Borgia family were falling.Pope Alexander VI died a year later, in August 1503. Some sources suggest that he was accidentally poisoned, although the cause is more likely to have been malaria. But whatever caused it, the pope’s death drained power from his son Cesare. Pursued by his enemies, he fled to his wife’s home in northern Spain, where he died in 1507.Meanwhile, Lucrezia had established herself in Ferrara. One of the most important texts of the Renaissance testifies to the esteem in which she was held in Ferrara: in Orlando Furioso, the poet Ludovico Ariosto affirms that Lucrezia ought to figure in the temple of honor to womanhood for her “beauty and honesty.” Even so, after her death on June 24, 1519, following a complicated childbirth, the image of Lucrezia started to come under attack. The many enemies of the Borgias smeared her name with allegations of lust, incest, and murder. No historical basis for these allegations has been found, and yet, in the popular imagination, they continue to distort the image of Lucrezia Borgia to this day.The arrival of Lucrezia in Ferrara in 1502 as the new wife of Alfonso d’Este caused a stir. Several observers wrote of the impact she made on them, and eulogized her grace and beauty. The Marquis of Crotone said that “had the bride made her entrance by torchlight she would have outshone them all.” The chronicler Bernardino Zambotto was deeply impressed by her “adorable eyes, full of life and joy.” He wrote glowingly of her refinement: “She has great tact, is prudent, very intelligent, lively, and most pleasant.” Nicolo Cagnolo of Parma wrote that “her whole being radiates good humor and joy beyond words.” Lucrezia was surrounded by poets and artists in Ferrara. Of these, the most notable was Ludovico Ariosto, the poet who coined the term “humanism,” and whose epic poem, Orlando Furioso, is a landmark text of Renaissance humanism. Despite tensions over Lucrezia’s intense, but apparently platonic, friendship with the poet Pietro Bembo, the relationship between Lucrezia and her husband seems to have been harmonious. In 1519, when she died, Alfonso is said to have cried bitterly at the loss of his “sweet companion.”",

"Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was better known as a sculptor when Pope Julius II tapped him to illuminate the Sistine Chapel. Known to the world as Michelangelo, the Florentine was just 24 when he sculpted his renowned “Pietà,” a tender depiction of the Virgin Mary cradling the lifeless body of her son. His towering “David” revealed his mastery of sculpting the human form.For all the skill and beauty of his work with a chisel, it is perhaps his work with a brush for which he is remembered most of all. The bold colors and striking composition of his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel still awe viewers with their power and emotion. The Sistine ceiling and the “Last Judgment” stand as a testament to Michelangelo’s genius as a painter and evolution as an artist.Take an amazing virtual tour of the Basilica of St. Peter.The Sistine ceiling was completed in 1512, a little before the Protestant Reformation. On the west wall, the “Last Judgment” fresco was unveiled nearly three decades later, as the effects of Martin Luther’s revolution spread across Europe. Both works reflect the spirit and themes of the times: the Renaissance love of the human body; the tension between wealth and faith; and, above all, an explosively vibrant rendering of the great stories of the Bible.In 1503 a new pope was appointed: the very worldly Pope Julius II, a self-declared lover of power, war, and art. Under his rule, Rome came to resemble a magnificent salon with a host of artists and architects at work on different projects. The precocity of the young Michelangelo—who, at Julius’s accession was sculpting the astonishing 17-foot-high “David” in Florence—reached the ears of the pontiff. In 1505 Julius summoned him to Rome to work on his future tomb, a commission that soon extended into a remodeling of St. Peter’s Basilica itself.Michelangelo wrote: “All the discords that arose between Pope Julius and me were owing to the envy of Bramante [Pope Julius’s chief architect] and of [the painter] Raphael.” Ascanio Condivi, Michelangelo’s first biographer, had a different theory: Bramante put forward Michelangelo’s name to paint the Sistine ceiling, but did so out of spite, calculating that when Michelangelo began to paint, his lack of expertise would be exposed and his career ended. Giorgio Vasari, in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, also follows this argument. Michelangelo was dubious of his abilities as a painter, so the theory may not be far-fetched. History has shown, however, that Bramante’s tactic spectacularly backfired.The papal tomb, which Michelangelo biographer Andrew Graham-Dixon has called “a megalomaniac fantasy, an obscene monument to ego, pride, and power,” was nonetheless a plum commission. After a run-in with the pope over non-payment for materials, however, Michelangelo left Rome in disgust. Julius, realizing his mistake, insisted that the artist continue working for him and ordered him back to work on an enticing new project: the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.When Michelangelo returned to Rome in 1508, Donato Bramante, the pope’s chief architect, and a sworn enemy of Michelangelo, was busy working on the new Basilica of St. Peter. In 1546, when he was an old man, Michelangelo would be appointed chief architect of the new St. Peter’s—which was finally completed in 1615—but this lay far in the future. Raphael, another rival, was starting work on frescoes in the pope’s private chambers, and next to such grand projects, the Sistine Chapel, with its plain exterior, might have seemed a lesser project.Its outer appearance was deceptive, for it was a special building inside: Restored a few decades before by Pope Sixtus IV (for whom it is named) it was the place of worship for the Papal Chapel, the part of the Vatican dedicated to assisting the pontiff in his spiritual functions. Today it is the setting of the conclave, where the cardinals choose a new pope. Pope Julius was adamant that he wanted only one artist to complete its decoration, and despite their previous altercation, he gave Michelangelo the job.Bramante was quick to complain how lacking in experience Michelangelo was for such an extraordinarily challenging project. He had a point: Michelangelo had learned the craft of mural painting in the studio of Domenico Ghirlandajo in Florence, where he was an apprentice at age 13. But he had never really worked as a painter, having moved instead into sculpting for the Medici family at age 15. He was commissioned to paint a battle fresco for Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio, and although some of his cartoons for this work have survived, the frescoes themselves were never painted. On various occasions, Michelangelo spoke of his own shortcomings, warning that his real talent was not for painting at all but for sculpture.Frescoes by other artists had already been painted on the walls. Michelangelo was to paint the whole ceiling, a structure roughly 132 feet long and 44 wide. Filling an expanse of nearly 6,000 square feet with frescoes would have daunted even the most experienced of painters. Even so, the Florentine held his nerve, and pushed for the best possible deal. In May 1508 a proposed plan was dismissed by the artist, who thought it “a poor thing.” In the next iteration he was given carte blanche.The scope was breathtaking: The vault itself is dedicated to episodes from the Old Testament, divided into three sections: the Creation, the Garden of Eden, and the Flood. The space left over was also filled with painting. In the semicircular lunettes above the windows, and in the roughly triangular spandrels, were placed biblical figures who preceded Christ. Panels above them were reserved for prophets who had, according to Christian scripture, foretold Christ. Faithful to the Renaissance classical spirit, Michelangelo included sibyls in this prophetic tradition, including the Libyan Sibyl. The pendentives at the four corners of the ceiling recount episodes in the salvation of Israel.Vast technical problems beset the artist at the outset. In his book Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, Giorgio Vasari, the 16th-century architect, artist, and writer, records some of Michelangelo’s trials. The fresco technique Michelangelo used, which requires applying washes of paint to wet plaster, left no room for error or revisions. Time was of the essence.Once sketches were prepared, they had to be divided up into sections that could be finished in one day. If he attempted to do too much at once, the plaster would dry out and would not absorb the colors. Once a section of wall had been chosen, it was prepared first with whitewash and then with plaster made from a mixture of pozzolanic ash, lime, and water. The drawing was transferred to the plaster, and then the colors were added immediately.Michelangelo brought a few trusted artists from his native Florence to work with him. But the Florentine plaster recipe they preferred did not work with the Roman materials and climate. Patches of mildew sprouted, and the paint had to be removed and reapplied, which slowed progress.In the eighth panel of the Genesis sequence, Michelangelo depicts people’s useless attempts to escape the rising floodwaters. He contrasts their fear and panic with Noah's ark, which sits serenely in the background, a place of quiet salvation.Meanwhile, Julius became so impatient for Michelangelo to complete the project that, according to Ascanio Condivi, the artist’s biographer, the pope threatened to throw the painter off the scaffolding and on one occasion actually hit him “with a stick.” Finally, in 1512, after four years of physical and creative dedication, Michelangelo finished his monumental work.Michelangelo’s contribution to the Sistine Chapel, however, was not complete. More than 20 years later, in 1536, Pope Paul III commanded that he paint a fresco of the Last Judgment on the wall behind the altar. Michelangelo, then over 60, reluctantly accepted. When the work was finished in 1541, Paul III is said to have fallen to his knees in prayer.In the decades since the completion of the ceiling in 1512, Paul III’s predecessors, Leo X, Adrian VI, and Clement VII, had been engulfed by the Reformation. Ironically, Luther’s revolution had begun in 1517 as a protest against the selling of indulgences to pay for the huge costs of Rome’s art spree. Since then, swaths of northern Europe had become Protestant.The tortured religious circumstances of Europe at the time inevitably color Michelangelo’s last contribution to the chapel. Filling the whole of the wall, the fresco is dominated by Christ who dispenses judgment. The naked figures that swarm against the lapis lazuli sky surround Christ; they are a combination of saints and martyrs. Michelangelo painted these fleshy, muscular bodies with a heft and weight not present in the figures on the ceiling.Unlike traditional hierarchical depictions of the Last Judgment, Michelangelo has chosen a more dynamic treatment of the subject where everything flows around the central figure of Christ. Angels lift souls from their graves on the left, judgment is rendered in the center, and the damned are dragged to hell on the right. Michelangelo’s depiction of hell was deeply influenced by Dante’s Inferno, and several figures from the work appear here. Beneath Christ, the ferryman Charon guides his boat of sinners across the river Acheron where the fiendish figure of Minos waits on the other side.By the middle of the 16th century the orthodoxy of the Counter-Reformation was strengthening. When Pius IV became pope in 1559, the years of hedonistic, art-loving popes were long past. The nudity in the “Last Judgment” was now seen as indecent. In 1562 the Council of Trent approved a decree regulating the use of images in churches, and Pius agreed that the nudity must be covered. Soon after Michelangelo died at age 88 in 1564, artist Daniele da Volterra was the first to censor the “Last Judgment,” and over the centuries, nearly 40 more coverings were added.In the 1980s and 1990s a major restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes revealed the vibrant colors that had been obscured over time. Michelangelo’s mastery of the human form was also revealed by removing many of the drapes added by censors. When seen today, the Sistine frescoes never fail to astonish with their beauty and complexity. They reveal two distinct phases of Renaissance art as well as two phases of Michelangelo’s artistic evolution.",
"It’s apparition time: 5:40 p.m. In a small Roman Catholic chapel in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the village of Medjugorje, Ivan Dragicevic walks down the aisle, kneels in front of the altar, bows his head for a moment, and then, smiling, lifts his gaze heavenward. He begins to whisper, listens intently, whispers again, and doesn’t blink for ten minutes. His daily conversation with the Virgin Mary has begun.Dragicevic was one of six poor shepherd children who first reported visions of the Virgin Mary in 1981. She identified herself to the four girls and two boys as the “Queen of Peace” and handed down the first of thousands of messages admonishing the faithful to pray more often and asking sinners to repent. Dragicevic was 16 years old, and Medjugorje, then in communist-controlled Yugoslavia, had yet to emerge as a hub of miracle cures and spiritual conversions, attracting 30 million pilgrims during the past three decades.I’m in Medjugorje with a group of Americans, mostly hockey dads from the Boston area, plus two men and two women with stage 4 cancer. We’re led by 59-year-old Arthur Boyle, a father of 13, who first came here on Labor Day weekend in 2000, riddled with cancer and given months to live. He felt broken and dejected and wouldn’t have made the trip had not two friends forced him into it. But that first night, after he went to confession at St. James the Apostle church, psychological relief came rapidly.“The anxiety and depression were gone,” he told me. “You know when you’re carrying someone on your shoulders in a swimming pool water fight—they come off, and you feel light and free? I was like, Wait a minute, what just happened to me? Why is that?”The next morning, with his friends Rob and Kevin, he met another of the “visionaries,” Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic, in a jewelry shop and asked for her help. Gripping his head with one hand, she appealed to the Virgin Mary to ask God to cure him. Boyle said he experienced an unusual sensation right there in the store. “She starts to pray over me. Rob and Kevin put their hands on me, and the heat that went through my body from her praying was causing them to sweat.”Back in Boston a week later, a CT scan at Massachusetts General Hospital revealed that his tumors had shrunk to almost nothing.Since then, Boyle has been back to Medjugorje 13 times. “I’m a regular guy,” he said. “I like to play hockey and drink beer. I play golf.” But, he continued, “I had to change things in my life.” Today, Boyle said, he’s become “a sort of mouthpiece for Jesus Christ’s healing power and of course the Mother and the power of her intercession.”Praying for the Virgin Mary’s intercession and being devoted to her are a global phenomenon. The notion of Mary as intercessor with Jesus begins with the miracle of the wine at the wedding at Cana, when, according to the Gospel of John, she tells him, “They have no wine,” thus prompting his first miracle. It was in A.D. 431, at the Third Ecumenical Council, in Ephesus, that she was officially named Theotokos, Bearer of God. Since then no other woman has been as exalted as Mary. As a universal symbol of maternal love, as well as of suffering and sacrifice, Mary is often the touchstone of our longing for meaning, a more accessible link to the supernatural than formal church teachings. Her mantle offers both security and protection. Pope Francis, when once asked what Mary meant to him, answered, “She is my mamá.”Her reported appearances, visions experienced often by very poor children living in remote or conflict-wracked areas, have intensified her mystery and aura. And when the children can’t be shaken from their stories—especially if the accounts are accompanied by inexplicable “signs” such as spinning suns or gushing springs—her wonder grows.Mary is everywhere: Marigolds are named for her. Hail Mary passes save football games. The image in Mexico of Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of the most reproduced female likenesses ever. Mary draws millions each year to shrines such as Fátima, in Portugal, and Knock, in Ireland, sustaining religious tourism estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year and providing thousands of jobs. She inspired the creation of many great works of art and architecture (Michelangelo’s “Pietà,” Notre Dame Cathedral), as well as poetry, liturgy, and music (Monteverdi’s Vespers for the Blessed Virgin). And she is the spiritual confidante of billions of people, no matter how isolated or forgotten.Muslims as well as Christians consider her to be holy above all women, and her name “Maryam” appears more often in the Koran than “Mary” does in the Bible. In the New Testament Mary speaks only four times, beginning with the Annunciation, when, according to Luke’s Gospel, the angel Gabriel appears to her and says she will bear “the Son of the Most High.” Mary answers, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord.” Her only extended speech, also in Luke, is the lyrical Magnificat, uttered in early pregnancy: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed.”Indeed they have.Yet clues about her life are elusive. Scholars of Mary must take what they can from Hebrew Scriptures, first-century Mediterranean texts, the New Testament, and archaeological digs.The Bible says she lived in Nazareth when Romans had control over the Jewish territory. After Mary became pregnant, her betrothed, Joseph, a carpenter, considered quietly leaving her until an angel came to him in a dream and told him not to. The birth of Jesus is mentioned in just two Gospels, Luke and Matthew. Mark and John refer to Jesus’ mother several times.The Evangelists were writing 40 to 65 years after Christ’s death and were not biographers, says Father Bertrand Buby, the author of a three-volume study, Mary of Galilee, and a distinguished member of the faculty in the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton, in Ohio. “So don’t expect them to have all the elements about Mary. Her life is picked up from hearsay.”Some of the latest Mary scholarship focuses on her as a Jewish mother. María Enriqueta García, in her sacred theology dissertation at the Marian Institute, explains that Mary brings us to Jesus, who is the light of the world, just as Jewish mothers light the Shabbat candles. “We see the relationship of Mary with us isn’t just any relationship—it’s sacred.”During the first millennium, as Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire and began spreading into Europe, Mary typically was portrayed as an imperial figure, the equal of emperors, dressed in royal purple and gold. In the second millennium, beginning in the 12th century, says medieval historian Miri Rubin of Queen Mary University of London, “she underwent a dramatic shift,” evolving into a more accessible, kinder, gentler maternal figure. She served as a substitute mother in monasteries and convents, which novices often entered at a tender age. “A mother’s love,” Rubin says, “came to express the core of the religious story.”Because so little is known of Mary from Scripture, “you can project on her whatever cultural values you have,” says Amy-Jill Levine, a professor of New Testament and Jewish studies at Vanderbilt University. “A cultural confection,” according to Rubin. Levine adds, “She can be the grieving mother, the young virgin, the goddess figure. Just as Jesus is the ideal man, Mary is the ideal woman.”During the Reformation (1517-1648), the idea of Mary as intercessor fell out of favor with Protestants, who advocated going straight to God in prayer. But Mary gained millions of new Catholic followers with the Spanish conquest in the New World in the early 1500s—and, more recently, in Africa as Christianity has spread there.Kibeho, a small town in southern Rwanda, is remembered as the place where the Virgin Mary appeared to three young girls and foretold of the blood and horror of the genocide that would traumatize the country in 1994, when the majority Hutu attacked the minority Tutsi and in three months more than 800,000 people were slaughtered.In March 1982 the local bishop asked Venant Ntabomvura, a doctor, to go to a girls boarding school on a hillside in Kibeho. He was to investigate three students who had reported visions and conversations with the Virgin Mary. Ntabomvura, a kindly ear, nose, and throat specialist who, at 89, is still practicing, says Alphonsine Mumureke had first told of visits by apparitions the previous November. When they occurred, he says, “she was talking to someone exactly as if she were talking on the phone.”Mary appeared first to Alphonsine, then to Anathalie Mukamazimpaka, followed by Marie Claire Mukangango. The girls said they spent countless hours in conversations with the Virgin, who called herself Nyina wa Jambo, Mother of the Word. Mary spoke to the girls so often that they called her Mama.I found Anathalie at dusk one evening in her modest home near her old school, surrounded by rosaries and statues of the Virgin.“The first time she appeared,” Anathalie said, “I was reciting the rosary, and she called me by my name. I heard her say, ‘Nathalie, my child.’ She looked very beautiful indeed, between 20 and 30 years old. She spoke in Kinyarwanda in a very calm and soft voice. She was in a blue veil and white dress. She never told me why she chose me. She said she appears to anyone she wants, anytime she wants, anywhere she wants.” She never mentioned any particular religion, Anathalie said. “She only asks us to love her as much as she loves us.”Mary’s dire prophecy came on a day in 1982 everyone expected to be especially happy: August 15, the Feast of Mary’s Assumption into heaven. Ntabomvura was there, and Gaspard Garuka, who lived nearby. The girls were crying because, they reported, the Virgin was in tears too, Garuka says. He remembers that Alphonsine “fell down many times, because what she watched was very terrible. One time she even asked, ‘Please, hide this from my eyes.’”Anathalie said that what Mary predicted “is exactly what I saw” during the genocide 12 years later. “People killing others using spears, burning fire, people’s skulls and heads cut off. I saw mass graves surrounded by so much darkness, blood running all over like rivers. All of this had been predicted.” Anathalie was able to flee Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and then Kenya. Alphonsine became a monastic sister in Italy. Marie Claire was killed in the genocide. On June 29, 2001, nearly 20 years after Alphonsine had first reported her apparition, Rwanda’s Bishop Augustin Misago and the Vatican declared that, yes, the Virgin Mary had appeared at Kibeho.Michael O’Neill, 39, a Stanford University graduate in mechanical engineering and product design, is the Virgin Mary’s big data numbers cruncher. On his website, MiracleHunter.com, he has codified every known apparition of Mary back to A.D. 40. Systematic investigation and documentation of supernatural occurrences began with the Council of Trent, the Catholic Church’s ecumenical reaction to the Reformation, more than 450 years ago. Of the 2,000 apparitions reported since then, Miracle Hunter cites a mere 28 as approved by local bishops, who are the first to decide whether “seers” seem plausible. Sixteen of those have been recognized by the Vatican.O’Neill, in his newly published book, Exploring the Miraculous, details the Vatican’s painstaking process when deciding whether to endorse an apparition as miraculous—“truly extraordinary.” The “authenticity” and mental stability of the seer are prime, and anyone suspected of trying to gain fame or riches from contact with the Virgin Mary is ignored or condemned.Medjugorje is one of some two dozen sites in wait-and-see mode for Vatican approval. The local bishops with authority over Medjugorje have never given credence to the apparitions and have been at odds with the Franciscan priests who run the parish and are staunch believers. To resolve the impasse, a Vatican commission was appointed. It concluded its work in 2014.The Vatican would never approve an alleged apparition whose message contradicted church teachings, and the faithful aren’t required to believe in apparitions. Many, including priests, do not. “What is from Mary versus what is captured and interpreted by the seer is hard to distinguish,” says Father Johann Roten, director of research and special projects at the University of Dayton’s Marian Library, with more than a hundred thousand volumes on Mary. Ultimately the decision is based on faith.“Miracles transcend physical nature and physical laws,” says Robert Spitzer, a Jesuit priest who heads the Magis Center in California, which according to its website is dedicated to explaining faith, physics, and philosophy. As Spitzer says, “Science looks for physical laws in nature, so you’re up against a paradox. Can you get a scientific test for miracles? No. Science will only test for physical laws or physical results.”Nonetheless, over the years, as part of the church’s investigative process, seers have been subjected to batteries of tests. There have been attempts to get the visionaries in Medjugorje to blink or react to loud noises while they experience apparitions. In 2001 the peer-reviewed Journal of Scientific Exploration reported on the visionaries’ “partial and variable disconnection from the outside world at the time of the apparitional experience.” The extreme sound and light sensations traveled normally to their brains, but “the cerebral cortex does not perceive the transmission of the auditory and visual neuronal stimuli.” So far, science has no explanation.In the medical profession what you and I might call a miracle is often referred to as “spontaneous remission” or “regression to mean.” Frank McGovern, the Boston urologic surgeon who had done all he could for Arthur Boyle, told me that the cancer’s virtual disappearance was a “rare” but statistically possible happening. But, he added, “I also believe there are times in human life when we are way beyond what we ever expect.”Did the intense heat Boyle experienced when Vicka Ivankovic-Mijatovic held his head in her hand play a part in his healing? According to the 2006 book Hyperthermia in Cancer Treatment: A Primer, “Spontaneous regression of some cancers has been demonstrated to be associated [with] the induction of fever and activation of immunity.”Boyle said that although he continued his tests after his return from Medjugorje, “it was faith that enabled me to get into a state of peace where my immune system rebooted itself and killed the cancer—that was all done through God.”Certain images and stories of the Virgin Mary are so powerful they help define a country. That’s the case with Our Lady of Guadalupe, whose image on the tilma, or cloak, of a poor Indian man gave rise, in 1531, to Mexican identity. Anyone witnessing the outpouring of love and devotion that pilgrims demonstrate for their beloved Madre on the days leading up to the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe—broadcast live throughout the country on December 12—can see that the Virgin Mary is deeply embedded in Mexican hearts and souls.Her image was what Mexicans carried into their war against Spain for independence in 1810 and their internal revolution in 1910. César Chávez marched with her banner in his fight to unionize farmworkers in California in the 1960s. Our Lady of Guadalupe conferred instant benediction on the once despised mestizo children of Spaniards and Indians. She is the symbol of la raza, the definition of what it means to be Mexican, and because of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexicans have always believed they’re special.At dawn on December 11, the day before the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, I drove southeast from Mexico City toward Puebla. Pilgrims were thronging in the opposite direction, toward the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the great shrine in the heart of the capital. Along the busy highway I saw people walking alone or in groups, packs of cyclists dressed alike, and numerous pickups flying by with flashing colored lights, artificial flowers, and statues of the Virgin wobbling in the back.I pulled off the highway at a camp in the woods where pilgrims sleep at night on the cold ground. Mariachi music blared from portable speakers near a small fire. A breakfast stand had been set up, with free coffee, tea, and pastries. A volunteer told me that leading up to the Feast of Guadalupe, they feed 5,000 pilgrims a day here.“Mexico belongs to the Virgin, and the Virgin belongs to Mexico,” said volunteer Treno Garay as he ladled out coffee. Four generations of women from one family said they walk ten hours a day from the town of Papalotla, in the state of Tlaxcala, but spend nights in the family truck, driven by a male relative. A 77-year-old woman was making the trek from Santa María, in the state of Puebla, with her 19-year-old grandson. A truck driver who comes from California each year put it this way: “Everyone has to visit their mother.”The next morning when I arrived at the plaza in front of the basilica, a steady stream of people of all ages—including Alejandra Anai Hernán de Romero, an 18-year-old mother clutching her sick seven-week-old baby, Dieguito, born with a kidney malfunction—were shuffling on their knees across the square, standing only when they entered the basilica. Many had tears streaming down their cheeks. Most I talked to said they were coming to give thanks: They had made a promise to the Virgin, and she had answered their prayer.In the basilica, behind the main altar, protected by glass, hung the original cloth image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, focusing the rapt attention of the faithful passing by on a moving walkway. According to legend, accepted by the church, it was in 1531 that the Virgin of Guadalupe spoke, in Nahuatl (the Aztec language), to Juan Diego, a baptized Indian canonized in 2002. She urged him to tell the bishop that she wanted a church built on the site, Tepeyac Hill, which had been a place for worshipping Aztec earth goddesses.Juan Diego didn’t have much luck with the bishop, who wanted a sign of some sort. Mary instructed him to climb the hill, cut some flowers, and present them to the bishop. Flowers don’t bloom there in December, but Juan Diego gathered a bouquet of beautiful roses, which he folded into his tilma, believed to be woven from agave fibers. When he finally got to see the bishop and opened his cloak, the roses spilled out, revealing the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. This is the only time Mary is said to have left a painted portrait of herself.Many art historians see this as a standard European depiction of Mary, typical of the 16th century. But within the past several decades some church scholars have begun to interpret the visual imagery to be a combination of Catholic and what they consider to be Aztec iconography. According to such recent interpretations, an illiterate Indian would instantly be able to read the symbols as a nonverbal catechism. The dusky woman’s dark hair is parted in the middle, possibly symbolizing that she’s a virgin, but she wears a black bow high around her waist, a sign that she’s pregnant. Around her neck is a brooch—not the green stone Aztec deities often displayed but a cross. Her downcast eyes show that she isn’t a goddess. Similarly, her hands, clasped in prayer, also communicate that she isn’t divine. One of her legs is bent, suggesting that she could be dancing in prayer. The turquoise of her cloak signifies divinity and sky to the Aztec. The glyph of a four-petaled flower in the center of her rose-colored tunic supposedly means that she is the god bearer.Sometime between 1531 and 1570 the original image on Juan Diego’s tilma was embellished. Gold stars were added to the Virgin’s mantle, aligned, according to a Mexican study published in 1983, in their configuration at dawn on December 12, 1531, the day the image allegedly appeared on the tilma. The Aztec greatly revered the sun god, and glowing rays added behind Mary signify that she comes from heaven and that her god has divine power. One theory holds that in Nahuatl, the word “Mexico” comes from three words that mean “in the center of the moon”—and Mary is standing in the center of a black crescent moon. Borne on the shoulders of an angel who, some say, has native features, she dominates both light and darkness.Remarkably, the image hasn’t deteriorated, according to the church, even though the cloth hung in the basilica for more than a century without protection, vulnerable to dirt and smoke. “She’s imprinted like a photo,” says Nydia Mirna Rodríguez Alatorre, director of the basilica museum, who explains that in 1785 a worker cleaning the silver frame accidentally spilled nitric acid on the image. It remained intact. An affidavit from several decades later says that the spill left only a vague mark like a water stain. In 1921 Luciano Pérez Carpio, who worked in an office of Mexico’s president tasked with weakening the grip of religion, placed a bomb in a bouquet of flowers below the image. The blast destroyed the altar and bent its bronze crucifix and the candelabra nearby. The image of the Virgin was untouched.“When the devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe disappears,” Rodríguez Alatorre says, “the identity of Mexico will disappear.”As the only woman to have her own sura, or chapter, in the Koran, Mary was chosen by God “above all other women of the world,” for her chastity and obedience. As in the Bible, an angel announces her pregnancy to her in the Muslim holy book. But unlike in the Bible, Mary—Maryam—gives birth alone. There’s no Joseph.“Mary is the purest and most virtuous of all women in the universe,” says Bakr Zaki Awad, dean of the theology faculty at Al Azhar University, Cairo’s leading theological university.In Egypt I talked with devout Muslims who, because of their reverence for the Virgin Mary, had no qualms about visiting Christian churches and praying to her in church as well as mosque. One day in Cairo I encountered two young Muslim women in head scarves standing in front of the old Coptic Abu Serga church, built over a cave that is said to have been used by the Holy Family. It was the eve of Coptic Easter, and inside, the congregants chanted and prayed for hours. Outside, the women said they loved Mary from studying her in the Koran.“Her story tells us a lot of things,” Youra, 21, said. “She is able to face lots of hardships in her life because of her faith, her belief in God.” Youra’s friend, Aya, added, “There’s a sura in her name in the Koran, so we were curious what was going on inside the church.”I met Nabila Badr, 53, at a Coptic church along the Nile in a part of Cairo called Al Adaweya—one of the many places in Egypt where the Holy Family is said to have stopped. Badr is a married mother of three and an events organizer for the governor of a state near Cairo. Along with her Koran, she carries Christian medals of the Virgin Mary in her purse. In a small room in the back of the church Badr mingled with Coptic Christians praying there, lit candle after candle, bowed, and prayed to an icon of Mary on the wall that was claimed to have once wept tears of oil. Badr said she talks to Mary about her life and that Mary has answered her several times by showing her visions in dreams that later came true.Like many Egyptians, Badr also believes in jinn, or spirits, who influence life for good or bad, although she claims only to have her own angel. “He too believes in the Virgin Mary,” she said. Badr often asks Mary to intercede for her, and she composed a poem to Mary. “When I feel down,” Badr said, “I pray to God very much, but I also consult Mary, and after a while things calm down.”At St. Mary’s church in Zaytun, a neighborhood in Old Cairo, apparitions of a silent Madonna bathed in white light are said to have appeared at night above the domes of the church for three years, from 1968 to 1971. Glowing white doves sometimes accompanied the apparitions. Yohanna Yassa, a Coptic priest who has ministered at St. Mary’s since 1964, told me that often Muslim women who want to get pregnant come to his church to pray. “Today we had a lady who came for a blessing,” he said. “Mary is calling us spiritually, and because of that, both Muslims and Christians love her and respect her.”Following the many paths of Mary, I learned that she has often appeared to people in crisis zones, such as Kibeho and Bosnia and Herzegovina, seeking to warn of danger or to serve as a symbol of healing. In her aftermath come physical cures said to be miraculous, as at Medjugorje, and spiritual healings too numerous to count. Lourdes, the Virgin’s most famous pilgrimage site, at the foot of the Pyrenees in southwestern France, is her miracle factory, with more than 7,000 miraculous cures claimed since the mid-1800s. Only 69 have been officially recognized by church authorities.Everything at Lourdes is about scale: more than a hundred acres, six million visitors a year, space for 25,000 worshippers in the giant underground basilica. It was built in 1958 to commemorate the centennial of the Virgin Mary’s first appearance, in 1858, to Bernadette, an illiterate 14-year-old peasant girl. (St. Bernadette was canonized on December 8, 1933.) The nearby Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, its stones worn by millions of feet, is where the Virgin is said to have commanded Bernadette to scoop up the mud with her hands to make a spring gurgle from the damp soil. That miraculous water is the source for baths that attract thousands daily in wheelchairs, and thousands more on foot, to pray for cures. Volunteers push les malades, the sick, in blue buggies in endless, snaking lines along Lourdes’s narrow streets, flanked by dozens of religious curio shops.The day I visited the baths, it was pouring rain, and cold. There’s a strict protocol for how you disrobe and then tie a light linen cloth around your body for a quick, private dip, supported under each arm by a volunteer. “Say your intention, make the sign of the cross, and we’ll escort you down,” a kindly Irish woman told me. Then came the freezing immersion—a bracing moment of deep peace.Shortly after World War II, members of the French and German militaries met at Lourdes to reconcile and heal the wounds of war; now every spring veterans groups are among the hordes of pilgrims. On May 14, 2015, I joined 184 wounded warriors—U.S. combat veterans who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan—and their families, sponsored by the Archdiocese for the Military Services and the Knights of Columbus. They had come for the annual pilgrimage of militaries (from 35 nations this year) to celebrate peace. For the rest of their lives, all these quietly brave men and women and those who support them must contend with debilitating injuries suffered sometimes during multiple deployments.Bustling among us was one of the most remarkable women I’ve ever come across: Army Col. (Ret.) Dorothy A. Perkins, 60, an affable triathlete and mother of two who was commanding a battalion of 480 soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, when the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. Because hers was the only battalion whose soldiers had crucial counterintelligence and interrogation expertise, she oversaw the soldiers’ deployment to five countries, and she sent a group to Guantánamo Bay to set up facilities for POWs. By 9/11 Perkins had already been to Iraq twice with the United Nations Special Commission as a team leader for weapons inspectors, and spent more than a decade in the Army in special ops. In 2006-07 she served as the principal adviser to the U.S. ambassador for hostage affairs in Iraq.Perkins grew up a poor white girl in a mostly black, inner-city neighborhood in Tacoma, Washington, with nominal support from her mother and alcoholic stepfather. At age ten, she was sent to pick berries in the fields. She learned German during a gap year between high school and college when she lived as an “indentured servant,” cleaning rooms in a family-owned hotel in the Bavarian Alps. Her only recreation was to hike the mountain trails, where she encountered little shrines to Mary.“My faith has always been at the core of who I am,” Perkins said. “It’s a choice I made early on.” Without family to rely on, Perkins said, the Virgin Mary became her anchor. “She loves you as much as you want. Through her to him, she focused me on making closer relations with Jesus.”Perkins attended the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit school, for 12 years but left a few credits short and graduated from SUNY, Albany. While in San Francisco, she took a job at Macy’s, working her way up the corporate ladder to become a senior executive. In college she also joined the Army Reserve. After marrying a Green Beret, she signed up with the Army full-time and worked in counterintelligence.For Perkins, “Lourdes really forces each person to look at herself spiritually. Everything is always rushing by so fast. We’re overwhelmed by media and caught up in the day-to-day. People don’t force themselves to look at what’s most important—the integrity of the soul.”During the closing ceremonies at a giant Mass in the basilica, one of the European bishops, preaching in French, said, “World War III is already under way in the Middle East and Africa.” He praised the military there for focusing “on peace, justice, and human rights. May this experience make you witnesses for hope.”I thought of the indelible scene of the candlelight procession the night before—thousands of pilgrims, from places ranging from Argentina to Zambia, silently lifting their candles in prayer. It had ended with dozens of veterans in wheelchairs lining up in front, next to the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, for songs and prayers. So many souls yearning to be witnesses for hope, so many souls imbued with the belief that the Virgin Mary was lighting their way.",
"King David was not born into royalty. He entered life as a humble shepherd, rose to found a dynasty, and became a central figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.In the Book of Samuel, Saul, the first king of Israel, failed to reach a decisive victory against an enemy tribe, the Philistines. God sent the Prophet Samuel to Bethlehem and guided him to David, a humble shepherd and talented musician. He brought the young man to Saul's court, where his harp was so soothing that Saul called for David whenever he was vexed by an “evil spirit” sent by God (I Samuel 9:16). Saul was so taken with this young man that he appointed David his armor bearer.David's victory over Goliath was a popular subject for Renaissance sculptors, including Andrea del Verrocchio in 1476.Soon thereafter, a major Philistine battle loomed. This time, the Philistines fielded a fearsome new weapon: a giant named Goliath, carrying a huge bronze spear (I Samuel 17:5-7). The Israelites were frozen in fear—except young David. Armed with only a sling, he picked a stone from a riverbed and slung it at Goliath’s head. David’s aim was true; the stone struck the giant and killed him, prompting the Philistines to flee. The Israelites were jubilant. Saul was compelled to place young David at the head of his army (I Samuel 18:5).Even though David then married Saul’s daughter Michal and became a close friend of Saul’s son Jonathan, an intense rivalry developed between the young new general and the king. Saul even began to plot to kill him. David had little choice but to flee to enemy territory.Soon the country was once again torn by war as Philistine forces gathered at Mount Gilboa, and Saul and his sons, all serving as commanders in his army, rushed to meet them. But God had turned against Saul, and the Israelite ranks were decimated. All of Saul’s sons fell to Philistine swords, including his heir, Jonathan. Badly wounded himself, Saul then fell upon his own sword (I Samuel 31:1-7).With Israel’s army in headlong retreat, the Philistines swarmed over the Hebrew highlands. Saul’s only surviving son, Ishbaal, was anointed as his successor, supported by the northern tribes. But the southern elders went to Hebron, David’s military base, and in due course anointed David king “over the house of Judah.”At first, David chose to ignore the Philistines and instead marched on Jerusalem (II Samuel 5:6). After capturing Jerusalem, David was then able to defeat the Philistines. Eventually, all of the regions in Canaan came under David’s control.Now, at last, David could turn his attention to building a state, ruled from a proper Israelite capital. He pitched the tent of the Tabernacle to house the Ark of the Covenant. This was obviously not a satisfactory solution, and the king complained to the Prophet Nathan that “I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent” (II Samuel 7:2). An oracle from God assured David that "the Lord will make you a house"—a Davidic dynasty—but that it would be up to his offspring (King Solomon) to “build a house for my name” (II Samuel 7:11-13).According to the Books of Samuel and the subsequent Books of Kings, David then expanded his territory until Israel had become the dominant state in the Levant, absorbing the nations of Ammon, Moab, and Edom. Modern research has questioned this claim, and many scholars believe that some of the legendary material surrounding David served to exalt him as an ideal king, as successful in peace as in war, beloved by God as well as his people.Indeed, David’s greatest achievement (and that of his son Solomon) is not the extent of their putative realm, but the fusion of the quarrelsome tribes into one nation. Some scholars have even questioned whether David is a historical figure, though the discovery of a stela from Tel Dan with the inscription bytdwd (which may mean “House of David”) would argue otherwise.Notwithstanding David’s political achievements, his personal life was filled with conflict and tragedy. David compromised his reputation by pursuing the beautiful Bathsheba, who was already married to Uriah, one of David’s top commanders. David ordered him placed in the front ranks of a planned assault against the Ammonites, where he was duly killed.As soon as Bathsheba finished her time of mourning, David married her, and she bore his son. But the Prophet Nathan sternly rebuked David for his evil scheming because it had “displeased the Lord,” and indeed, the baby died (II Samuel 11:27). David then repented before God, and in return was promised that Bathsheba would bear him a second son. His name was Solomon. As David grew older and feeble, Bathsheba extracted David’s promise that their son Solomon would succeed him. And so it came to pass.",
"A herder serenades his goats near Jerusalem, a few miles from where David tended his herds.The woman sitting on a bench in the Old City of Jerusalem, round-faced and bundled up against the autumn chill, chews on an apple while studying the building that has brought her both fame and aggravation. It doesn't really look like a building—just some low stone walls abutting an ancient terraced retaining wall 60 feet high. But because the woman is an archaeologist, and because this is her discovery, her eyes see what others might not. She sees the building's position, on a northern escarpment of the ancient city overlooking Jerusalem's Kidron Valley, and she imagines an ideal perch from which to survey a kingdom. She imagines the Phoenician carpenters and stonemasons who erected it in the tenth century B.C. She imagines as well the Babylonians who destroyed it four centuries later. Most of all, she imagines the man she believes commissioned and occupied the building. His name was David. This, she has declared to the world, is most likely the building described in the Second Book of Samuel: "King Hiram of Tyre sent … carpenters and masons, and they built a house for David. And David realized that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel."The woman's name is Eilat Mazar. Munching and gazing, she is the picture of equanimity—until a tour guide shows up. He's a young Israeli man accompanied by a half dozen tourists who assemble in front of the bench so they can view the building. The moment he opens his mouth, Mazar knows what's coming. The tour guide is a former archaeology student of hers. She's heard how he brings tourists to this spot and informs them that this is NOT the palace of David and that all the archaeological work at the City of David is a way for right-wing Israelis to expand the country's territorial claims and displace Palestinians.Mazar jumps up from the bench and marches over to the tour guide. She chews him out in a staccato of Hebrew, while he stares passively at her. The gaping tourists watch her stalk off."You really need to be strong," she mutters as she walks. "It's like everyone wants to destroy what you do." And then, more plaintively: "Why? What did we do wrong?"The archaeologist gets into her car. She looks stricken. "I feel like I'm really getting sick from stress," she says. "I've lost years from my life."In no other part of the world does archaeology so closely resemble a contact sport. Eilat Mazar is one of the reasons why. Her announcement in 2005 that she believed she had unearthed the palace of King David amounted to a ringing defense of an old-school proposition under assault for more than a quarter century—namely, that the Bible's depiction of the empire established under David and continued by his son Solomon is historically accurate. Mazar's claim has emboldened those Christians and Jews throughout the world who maintain that the Old Testament can and should be taken literally. Her purported discovery carries particular resonance in Israel, where the story of David and Solomon is interwoven with the Jews' historical claims to biblical Zion.That narrative is familiar to any student of the Bible. A young shepherd named David from the tribe of Judah slays the giant Goliath from the enemy tribe of the Philistines, is elevated to king of Judah following the death of Saul at the close of the 11th century B.C., conquers Jerusalem, unites the people of Judah with the disparate Israelite tribes to the north, and thereupon amasses a royal dynasty that continues with Solomon well into the tenth centuryB.C. But while the Bible says David and Solomon built the kingdom of Israel into a powerful and prestigious empire stretching from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River, from Damascus to the Negev, there's a slight problem—namely, that despite decades of searching, archaeologists had found no solid evidence that David or Solomon ever built anything.Then Mazar sounded her trumpet. "She knew what she was doing," says fellow Israeli archaeologist David Ilan of Hebrew Union College. "She waded into the fray purposefully, wanting to make a statement."Ilan himself doubts that Mazar has found King David's palace. "My gut tells me this is an eighth- or ninth-century building," he says, constructed a hundred years or more after Solomon died in 930B.C. More broadly, critics question Mazar's motives. They note that her excavation work was underwritten by two organizations—the City of David Foundation and the Shalem Center—dedicated to the assertion of Israel's territorial rights. And they scoff at Mazar's allegiance to the antiquated methods of her archaeological forebears, such as her grandfather, who unapologetically worked with a trowel in one hand and the Bible in the other.The once common practice of using the Bible as an archaeological guide has been widely contested as an unscientific case of circular reasoning—and with particular relish by Tel Aviv University's contrarian-in-residence Israel Finkelstein, who has made a career out of merrily demolishing such assumptions. He and other proponents of "low chronology" say that the weight of archaeological evidence in and around Israel suggests that the dates posited by biblical scholars are a century off. The "Solomonic" buildings excavated by biblical archaeologists over the past several decades at Hazor, Gezer, and Megiddo were not constructed in David and Solomon's time, he says, and so must have been built by kings of the ninth-century B.C.'s Omride dynasty, well after David and Solomon's reign.During David's time, as Finkelstein casts it, Jerusalem was little more than a "hill-country village," David himself a raggedy upstart akin to Pancho Villa, and his legion of followers more like "500 people with sticks in their hands shouting and cursing and spitting—not the stuff of great armies of chariots described in the text."Of course we're not looking at the palace of David!" Finkelstein roars at the very mention of Mazar's discovery. "I mean, come on. I respect her efforts. I like her—very nice lady. But this interpretation is—how to say it?—a bit naive."Now it is Finkelstein's theory that is under siege. On the heels of Mazar's claim to have discovered King David's palace, two other archaeologists have unveiled remarkable finds. Twenty miles southwest of Jerusalem in the Elah Valley—the very spot where the Bible says the young shepherd David slew Goliath—Hebrew University professor Yosef Garfinkel claims to have unearthed the first corner of a Judaean city dating to the exact time that David reigned. Meanwhile, 30 miles south of the Dead Sea in Jordan, a University of California, San Diego professor named Thomas Levy has spent the past eight years excavating a vast copper-smelting operation at Khirbat en Nahas. Levy dates one of the biggest periods of copper production at the site to the tenth century B.C.—which, according to the biblical narrative, is when David's antagonists the Edomites dwelled in this region. (However, scholars like Finkelstein maintain that Edom did not emerge until two centuries later.) The very existence of a large mining and smelting operation fully two centuries before Finkelstein's camp maintains the Edomites emerged would imply complex economic activity at the exact time that David and Solomon reigned. "It's possible that this belonged to David and Solomon," Levy says of his discovery. "I mean, the scale of metal production here is that of an ancient state or kingdom."Levy and Garfinkel—both of whom have been awarded grants by the National Geographic Society—support their contentions with a host of scientific data, including pottery remnants and radiocarbon dating of olive and date pits found at the sites. If the evidence from their ongoing excavations holds up, yesteryear's scholars who touted the Bible as a factually accurate account of the David and Solomon story may be vindicated.As Eilat Mazar says with palpable satisfaction, "This is the end of Finkelstein's school."A busy highway, Route 38, crosses the ancient road that follows the Elah Valley en route to the Mediterranean Sea. Beneath the hills on either side of the road lie the ruins of Socoh and Azekah. According to the Bible, the Philistines encamped in this valley, between the two towns, just before their fateful encounter with David.The battlefield of legend is now quiet and abounds with wheat, barley, almond trees, and grapevines, not to mention a few of the indigenous terebinth (elah in Hebrew) trees from which the valley derives its name. A small bridge extends from Route 38 over the Brook of Elah. During high season, tourist buses park here so that their passengers can climb down into the valley and retrieve a rock to take back home and impress friends with a stone from the same place as the one that killed Goliath."Maybe Goliath never existed," says Garfinkel as he drives across the bridge and up to his site, Khirbet Qeiyafa. "The story is that Goliath came from a giant city, and in the telling of it over the centuries, he became a giant himself. It's a metaphor. Modern scholars want the Bible to be like the Oxford Encyclopedia. People didn't write history 3,000 years ago like this. In the evening by the fire, this is where stories like David and Goliath started."Beneath Garfinkel's bald, scholarly exterior and gentle sense of humor—which reveals a jagged edge when the subject is Israel Finkelstein—lurks a man of unmistakable ambition. He first learned from an Israeli Antiquities Authority ranger about a nine-foot-high megalithic wall looming over the Brook of Elah. He began digging in earnest in 2008.The wall, Garfinkel discovered, was of the same variety seen in the northern cities of Hazor and Gezer—a casemate of two walls with a chamber in between—and it encircled a fortified city of about six acres. Private houses abutted the city wall, an arrangement not seen in Philistine society. After shoveling out the topsoil, Garfinkel uncovered coins and other artifacts from the time of Alexander the Great. Beneath that Hellenistic layer he found buildings scattered with four olive pits, which carbon-14 analysis dated to around 1000 B.C.He also found an ancient tray for baking pita bread, along with hundreds of bones from cattle, goats, sheep, and fish—but no pig bones. In other words, Judaeans, rather than Philistines, must have lived (or at least dined) here. Because Garfinkel's excavation team also uncovered a very rare find—a clay pottery sherd with writing that appears to be a proto-Canaanite script with verbs characteristic of Hebrew—the conclusion to him seemed obvious: Here was a tenth-century B.C. complex Judaean society of the sort that low chronologists like Finkelstein claimed did not exist.And what was its name? Garfinkel found his answer upon discovering that the fortified city had not one but two gates—the only such site found thus far in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. "Two gates" translates into Hebrew as shaarayim, a city mentioned three times in the Bible. One of those references (I Samuel 17:52) describes the Philistines fleeing David back to Gath via the "road from Shaaraim.""You have David and Goliath, and you have our site, and it fits," says Garfinkel simply. "It's typical Judaea, from the animal bones to the city wall. Give us two arguments why this is Philistine. One argument is because Finkelstein doesn't want us to destroy low chronology. OK, so give us a second reason."Here would be a second reason to be skeptical of Yossi Garfinkel's conclusions: He announced them, swiftly and dramatically, despite the fact that he had only four olive pits on which to base his dating, a single inscription of a highly ambiguous nature, and a mere 5 percent of his site excavated. In other words, says archaeologist David Ilan, "Yossi has an agenda—partly ideological, but also personal. He's a very smart and ambitious guy. Finkelstein's the big gorilla, and the young bucks think he's got a monopoly over biblical archaeology. So they want to dethrone him."Better still, from the perspective of other interested parties: Once Finkelstein retreats from the throne, King David returns to it.He has persisted for three millennia—an omnipresence in art, folklore, churches, and census rolls. To Muslims, he is Daoud, the venerated emperor and servant of Allah. To Christians, he is the natural and spiritual ancestor of Jesus, who thereby inherits David's messianic mantle. To the Jews, he is the father of Israel—the shepherd king anointed by God—and they in turn are his descendants and God's Chosen People. That he might be something lesser, or a myth altogether, is to many unthinkable."Our claim to being one of the senior nations in the world, to being a real player in civilization's realm of ideas, is that we wrote this book of books, the Bible," says Daniel Polisar, president of the Shalem Center, the Israeli research institute that helped fund Eilat Mazar's excavation work. "You take David and his kingdom out of the book, and you have a different book. The narrative is no longer a historical work, but a work of fiction. And then the rest of the Bible is just a propagandistic effort to create something that never was. And if you can't find the evidence for it, then it probably didn't happen. That's why the stakes are so high."The books of the Old Testament outlining the story of David and Solomon consist of scriptures probably written at least 300 years after the fact, by not-so-objective authors. No contemporaneous texts exist to validate their claims. Since the dawn of biblical archaeology, scholars have sought in vain to verify that there really was an Abraham, a Moses, an Exodus, a conquest of Jericho. At the same time, says Amihai Mazar, Eilat's cousin and among Israel's most highly regarded archaeologists, "Almost everyone agrees that the Bible is an ancient text relating to the history of this country during the Iron Age. You can look at it critically, as many scholars do. But you can't ignore the text—you must relate to it."But, adds Mazar, "you shouldn't seek to prove the text verbatim." And yet multitudes of archaeologists have made that very goal their life's work, beginning with the American scholar and godfather of biblical archaeology William Albright. Among Albright's protégés was the Israeli military titan, politician, and scholar Yigael Yadin. For Yadin and his contemporaries, the Bible was unassailable. As a result, when he uncovered the city gates at the biblical city of Hazor in the late 1950s, Yadin committed what would be a current-day archaeological no-no: Since carbon dating wasn't available, he used the Bible, along with the stratigraphy, to date the pottery found inside the gates. He attributed the gates to the exalted tenth-century B.C. empire of Solomon—because the First Book of Kings said so.The problem with relying on this particular chapter of the Bible is that it was added long after Solomon died in 930 B.C., when Israel had split into two parts—Judah in the south and Israel in the north. "Gezer was the most southerly city in the northern kingdom of Israel, while Hazor was in the most northern realm, and Megiddo was an economic hub in the center," says Tel Aviv University archaeologist Norma Franklin. "So it would be important to the people writing this story to lay claim to all of this territory. To Yadin, the Bible said so and that was it. Three gates—they all have to be Solomon's."Today, many scholars (including Franklin and her colleague Finkelstein) doubt that all three gates are Solomonic, while others (Amihai Mazar, for example) think they could be. But all of them reject Yadin's circular reasoning, which in the early 1980s helped spawn a backlash movement of "biblical minimalism," led by scholars at the University of Copenhagen. To the minimalists, David and Solomon were simply fictitious characters. The credibility of that position was undercut in 1993, when an excavation team in the northern Israel site of Tel Dan dug up a black basalt stela inscribed with the phrase "House of David." Solomon's existence, however, remains wholly unverified.Absent more evidence, we're left with the decidedly drab tenth-century B.C. biblical world that Finkelstein first proposed in a 1996 paper—not a single great kingdom replete with monumental buildings but instead a scruffy landscape of disparate, slowly gelling powers: the Philistines to the south, Moabites to the east, Israelites to the north, Aramaeans farther north, and yes, perhaps, a Judaean insurgency led by a young shepherd in not-so-dazzling Jerusalem. Such an interpretation galls Israelis who regard David's capital as their bedrock. Many of the excavations undertaken in Jerusalem are financially backed by the City of David Foundation, whose director of international development, Doron Spielman, freely admits, "When we raise money for a dig, what inspires us is to uncover the Bible—and that's indelibly linked with sovereignty in Israel."Unsurprisingly, this agenda does not sit well with the Jerusalem residents who happen to be Palestinian. Many excavations take place in the eastern part of the city, where their families have dwelled for generations but stand to be displaced if such projects morph into Israeli settlement claims. From the Palestinian perspective, the scurrying for archaeological evidence to justify a people's sense of belonging misses the point. As East Jerusalem resident and archaeology professor Hani Nur el-Din says, "When I see Palestinian women making the traditional pottery from the early Bronze Age, when I smell the taboon bread baked in the same tradition as the fourth or fifth millennium B.C., this is the cultural DNA. In Palestine there's no written document, no historicity—but still, it's history."Most Israeli archaeologists would prefer that their work not be used as a political wedge. This, nonetheless, is the way of young nations. As Bar-Ilan University archaeology professor Avraham Faust observes, "The Norwegians relied on Viking sites to create a separate identity from their Swedish and Danish rulers. Zimbabwe is named after an archaeological site. Archaeology is a very convenient tool for creating national identities."That is one way in which Israel differs from other countries. Its national identity came well before any digging. What's dug up can only confirm that identity … or not."This place was hell," says Tom Levy cheerfully as he stands over an open pit filled with ancient coal-black slag. Sprawling around him and his volunteer undergraduates from the University of California, San Diego is a 25-acre copper production site—and adjacent to it, a large fortress complex that includes the ruins of 3,000-year-old guardhouses. Apparently the sentinels lived practically on top of the smelting operations, while overseeing a presumably reluctant labor force. "When you have industrial production of this scale, you have to have a procurement system for food and water," Levy continues. "I can't prove it, but I think that the only people that are going to be working in this rather miserable environment are either slaves—or undergrads. The point is, simple tribal societies couldn't do something like this."Levy, an anthropologist, first came to southern Jordan in 1997 to examine metallurgy's role in social evolution. The lowland district of Faynan, where the blue-green glitter of malachite can be seen from a distance, was an obvious place to study. It also happened to be where the American rabbi and archaeologist Nelson Glueck unabashedly proclaimed in 1940 that he had discovered the Edomite mines controlled by King Solomon. Subsequent British excavators believed they had found evidence that Glueck was off by some three centuries and that Edom actually dated to the seventh century B.C. But when Levy started probing the site known as Khirbat en Nahas (Arabic for "ruins of copper"), the samples he sent off to Oxford for radiocarbon dating confirmed that Glueck had been on the right track: This was a tenth-century copper-production site—and, Levy adds pointedly, "the closest copper source to Jerusalem."The team headed by Levy and his Jordanian colleague Mohammad Najjar has uncovered a four-chambered gate similar to ones found at sites in Israel that might date to the tenth-century B.C. A few miles from the mines, they've excavated a cemetery of more than 3,500 tombs dating to the same period—perhaps filled with the remains of Iron Age mountain nomads known from ancient Egyptian sources as Shasu, who Levy thinks may have been "corralled at certain points in time and forced to work in the mines." Most work in the mines appears to have ceased by the end of the ninth century—and the so-called "disruption layer" uncovered by Levy's students may explain why.They found in this layer 22 date pits, which they dated to the tenth century B.C., along with Egyptian artifacts such as a lion-headed amulet and a scarab, both from the time of the pharaoh Shoshenq I. That ruler's invasion of the region shortly after Solomon's death is chronicled in the Old Testament and at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. "I definitely believe that Shoshenq disrupted metal production here at the end of the tenth century," says Levy. "The Egyptians in the Third Intermediate Period weren't strong enough to field an occupying force, which is why you don't see Egyptian bread molds and other material culture here. But they could organize some pretty big military campaigns—strong enough to upset these petty kingdoms, to make sure they wouldn't be a threat to them. That's what I think Shoshenq did here."The "hell" that Levy has unearthed at Khir­bat en Nahas could prove to be hell for the Finkelstein school of low chronology. Levy's copper mines may not be as sexy as King David's palace or the perch overlooking the battle of David and Goliath. But Levy's excavation work spans more time and area than those of Eilat Mazar and Yosef Garfinkel, with far more extensive use of radiocarbon analysis to determine the age of his site's stratigraphic layers. "All scholars dealing with Edom in the last two generations claimed that Edom didn't exist as a state before the eighth centuryB.C.," says Amihai Mazar. "But Levy's radiocarbon dates have their own story, and that story is related to the tenth to ninth century B.C., and no one can claim that they're incorrect."In fact, that is precisely what Levy's critics are doing. Some deemed his first 46 datings insufficient to justify reordering an entire chronology for Edom. For his second round of C-14 analysis, Levy doubled the number of samples and meticulously selected charcoal from shrubs with verifiable outer growth rings.Despite the high cost of C-14 analysis—more than $500 for a single olive pit—the technique isn't a silver bullet. "Carbon-14 doesn't help you solve all this controversy," says Eilat Mazar. "You have the plus or minus"—a margin of error of about 40 years. "You have different laboratories bringing different interpretations. You have debates about the whole C-14 issue." Indeed, Finkelstein and Amihai Mazar have been locked in an ongoing tussle over the dating of a single stratum at Tel Rehov, a Bronze and Iron Age city just west of the Jordan River. Mazar contends that the stratum could be Solomonic. Finkelstein says it's from the later Omride dynasty, named for Omri, Ahab's father. The gap between the two eras is about 40 years."Many of the radiocarbon dates for this period cover exactly the range that's under debate," Amihai Mazar says, chuckling wearily. "Not before and not after. It's been this way for 15 years.""You can find evidence in radiocarbon for David being a villager in Norway in the sixth century A.D.!" declares Israel Finkelstein—exaggerating to make a point, as he is prone to doing. "But look, I enjoy reading everything Tom writes about Khirbat en Nahas. It has brought all sorts of ideas to me. I myself would never dig in such a place—too hot! For me, archaeology is about having a good time. You should come to Megiddo—we live in an air-conditioned B&B next to a nice swimming pool."This is how Finkelstein begins his rebuttals, with amiable preambles that cannot conceal the Mephisto-like gleam in his eyes. For a scholar, the Tel Aviv archaeologist has a highly visceral manner—leaning his tall, bearded frame into a visitor's face, waving his large hands, modulating his baritone with Shakespearean agility.Yet his charm wears thin for those who have felt the sting of his attacks. "If you want to attract attention, you behave like Finkelstein," says Eilat Mazar. Similarly unamused is Yosef Garfinkel, who says of Finkelstein's recent receipt of a four-million-dollar research grant, "He doesn't even use science—that's the irony. It's like giving Saddam Hussein the Nobel Peace Prize."Still, Finkelstein's theories strike an intellectually appealing middle ground between biblical literalists and minimalists. "Think of the Bible the way you would a stratified archaeological site," he says. "Some of it was written in the eighth century B.C., some the seventh, and then going all the way to the second B.C. So 600 years of compilation. This doesn't mean that the story doesn't come from antiquity. But the reality presented in the story is a later reality. David, for example, is a historical figure. He did live in the tenth century B.C. I accept the descriptions of David as some sort of leader of an upheaval group, troublemakers who lived on the margins of society. But not the golden city of Jerusalem, not the description of a great empire in the time of Solomon. When the authors of the text describe that, they have in their eyes the reality of their own time, the Assyrian Empire."Now, Solomon," he continues with a sigh. "I think I destroyed Solomon, so to speak. Sorry for that! But take Solomon, dissect it. Take the great visit of the Queen of Sheba—an Arabian queen coming to visit, bringing all sorts of exotic commodities to Jerusalem. This is a story which is an impossibility to think about before 732 B.C., before the beginning of Arabian trade under Assyrian domination. Take the story of Solomon as the great, you know, trainer in horses and chariots and big armies and so on. The world behind Solomon is the world of the Assyrian century."Of Levy's mining fortress, Finkelstein says, "I don't buy that it's from the tenth century B.C.There's no way people lived on this site during production. The fire, the toxic fumes—forget it! Instead, look at the fortress of En Hazeva on our side of the Jordan River, built by the Assyrians on the main road to Edom. I see Tom's building as an eighth-century Assyrian fortress parallel to the other one. And look, at the end of the day, his is a marginal site. It's not a stratified city with many eras, like Megiddo and Tel Rehov. Taking a pile of slag and making it the center of the discussion of biblical history—forget it, no way, I reject this absolutely!"With greater venom, Finkelstein mocks Garfinkel's discoveries at Khirbet Qeiyafa: "Look, you'll never catch me saying, 'I've found one olive pit at a stratum in Megiddo, and this olive pit—which goes against hundreds of carbon-14 determinations—is going to decide the fate of Western civilization.' " He snickers. The lack of pig bones, suggesting it is a Judaean site? "A gun, but not a smoking gun." The rare inscription found at the site? Probably from Philistine Gath rather than the kingdom of Judah.The irony is that biblical archaeology's enfant terrible has become the establishment, a Goliath fending off upstart assaults on his chronological order. The proposition that a complex tenth-century B.C. society may have existed on either side of the Jordan River has thrown Finkelstein's vision of the David and Solomon era squarely on the defensive. His many rebuttal papers and his sarcastic tone reflect that defensiveness, and his arguments at times seem a bit desperate. (The notion of living in a fortress next to a copper-smelting site would not seem ludicrous to West Virginia coal miners or residents near Three Mile Island, for example.)Still, even if Garfinkel can prove that the Judah tribe that begat David dwelled in the fortress of Shaaraim, and Eilat Mazar can document that King David commissioned a palace in Jerusalem, and Tom Levy can successfully demonstrate that King Solomon oversaw copper mines in Edom, this does not a glorious biblical dynasty make. How much digging before the argument is settled?Many archaeologists question whether the obsessive scramble to prove the biblical narrative is a healthy enterprise. One of them, Tel Aviv University's Raphael Greenberg, flatly states, "It's bad for archaeology. What we're supposed to contribute is a point of view that isn't available from texts or preconceived notions of history—an alternative vision of the past: relations between rich and poor, between men and women. Something richer, in other words, than just validating the Bible."But does David, with all of his metaphorical power, cease to matter if his deeds and his empire are ultimately viewed as works of fiction? When I point out to Finkelstein that people all over the world are invested in the greatness of David, I am surprised by his response. "Look, when I'm doing research, I have to distinguish between the culture of David and the historical David. David is extremely important for my cultural identity. In the same way, I can cele­brate the Exodus without seeing it as a purely historic event. David for me is the David reflected in the later king Hezekiah, the David reflected in the later king Josiah, the David of Zacharias in the eschatological prophesies in which Jerusalem is burned but David is alive, the David who is the connection with the beginning of Christianity. In this sense, David is everything. If you want me to say it simplistically, I'm proud that this nobody from nowhere became the center of Western tradition."So for me," says Finkelstein, David's dethroner, "David is not a plaque on the wall, not even merely a leader of a tenth-century band. No. Much more than that."",
"This 360-degree view allows you to see the splendor of St. Peter’s Basilica on your computer, tablet, or mobile device. Use the toolbar to shift your view or zoom in. On a tablet or mobile device, just hold it up or turn it around to pan.St. Peter’s Basilica is one of the most spectacular churches in the world. Although some may confuse it for the “mother church” of Roman Catholics, it isn't even a cathedral because it's not the seat of the pope, who is also the bishop of Rome. That distinction belongs to the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. But because of its size, grandeur, and location within Vatican City, papal authorities use the church for numerous ceremonies. Its capacity is enormous—it can hold 20,000 seated worshippers or 60,000 standing.Start your tour with the baldachin, the great canopy over the papal altar and St. Peter’s tomb, crafted by master artist and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The canopy took nine years to build and was completed in 1633. It is made of 90 tons of bronze, most of it from the portico of Rome’s Pantheon. It is over 95 feet tall, almost as tall as a ten-story building.St. Peter’s tomb is directly below it. You can see two wings of the ornate balustrade separated by a gate that opens to the sunken, semicircular area in front of the papal altar, known as the Confessio, or Chapel of the Confession. This refers to the confession of faith by St. Peter, which led to his martyrdom. The tomb itself is not visible, as it is down a set of stairs and tucked into a niche at the back of the Confessio. You can only view it on a special tour of the Scavi, or excavations, in the ancient necropolis.Directly above is Michelangelo’s dome, rising 448 feet to the top of the cross on the lantern tower outside. You can see the inner hemispherical layer of its double shell; a slightly more pointed one is visible outdoors. It is 140 feet in diameter—one of the largest domes in the world. The colorful mosaics around the dome depict Jesus, Mary, Joseph, St. John the Baptist, and the Twelve Apostles. You can just make out the image of God bestowing his blessing upon mankind through the oculus, the round opening at the crown of the dome.Around the drum of the dome in blue letters standing almost seven feet tall is the inscription TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM. ET TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM. The biblical citation, from Matthew 16:18-19, translates as: “You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church, and to you I will give the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.”If you look through the baldachin toward the apse at the end of the central nave, you will see the glowing light of the alabaster window depicting the Holy Spirit as a dove (the dove is six feet tall). Below that is the Altar of the Chair of St. Peter, a monumental sculpture by Bernini. It contains the relics of an ancient chair, reputedly from which St. Peter preached. The altar symbolizes the teaching authority of the pope.Immediately behind you, you will find the statue of St. Peter Enthroned, set in front of a maroon-and-gold mosaic curtain. This 13th-century bronze sculpture is attributed to Arnolfo di Campio. St. Peter’s hands are raised in the act of blessing, and over the course of seven centuries of devotion, the custom of kissing or touching the right foot has almost completely worn away the toes.Gaze at the boldly patterned marble floor of the nave. If you're facing the barricade and row of chairs in the direction of the atrium, you'll see a glare on a maroon rectangle. That tile shows the keys of heaven, a symbol found throughout Vatican City. There are also plaques commemorating popes, as well as markers that indicate the comparative length of several of the largest churches in the world. You can also see a glimpse of what look like lavishly decorated manhole covers (for example, in front of the rows of chairs). These are portals to the tombs of popes below the floor, including that of John Paul II, who was pope from 1978 to 2005.All around you are spectacular works of art that look like paintings but aren’t. They are mosaics made of tiny tiles, or tesserae, each about the size of a fingernail. Mosaics were chosen over paintings to decorate the basilica so that they wouldn’t be vulnerable to the ravages of time, smoke, and humidity—eternal art for the eternal church. Four marvelous examples are the mosaic medallions that decorate the area between the main cupola of the basilica and the enormous piers underneath. These medallions represent the four evangelists who composed the Gospels. We can see St. Matthew on the left above the baldachin, and St. John on the right.Set into the great piers that support the dome are four colossal marble statues. These statues embody crucial moments of Christ’s Passion. Starting from the right of the altar you see the statue of St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, holding the True Cross (by Bolgi). Continuing clockwise, you'll note the statue of St. Longinus gripping the sacred lance used to pierce Christ’s side (by Bernini). Continuing toward the right, the next statue you see is that of St. Andrew, Peter’s brother, representing the moment of his crucifixion in Greece (by Duquesnoy). And turning back toward the baldachin, the last statue is of St. Veronica displaying the veil she used to wipe Jesus’s face on the road to Calvary (by Mochi).",
"Perhaps the devil’s most famous depiction was crafted by English poet John Milton in his 1667 masterpiece, Paradise Lost. The epic poem tells two stories: one of the fall of man and the other the fall of an angel. Once the most beautiful of all angels, Lucifer rebels against God and becomes Satan, the adversary, who is:Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire . . .To develop his character, Milton relied on an idea of the devil that had been evolving throughout the Middle Ages and early Renaissance: the foe of God and man, the master of witches, and the tempter of sinners. This personage was largely fixed in the collective consciousness of Christendom, but the devil’s origins are complex, coming from many places, not just the Bible.The Christian Bible devotes only a few passages to the devil and does not describe his appearance. In Genesis the serpent who tempts Eve is strongly associated with Satan, but many theologians think the composition of Genesis predates the concept of the devil. Passages alluding to Lucifer’s fall can be found in the books of Isaiah and Ezekiel. The Old Testament’s Satan is not the opponent of God, but rather an adversary as exemplified by his role in the Book of Job. (See also: Halloween: costumes, history, myths and more)The oldest representation of the Christian idea of the devil may be this mosaic in the Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna, Italy. The sixth-century mosaic shows Jesus Christ, dressed in royal purple, seated at the Last Judgment. He is separating the souls of the saved (symbolized by sheep) from the souls of the damned (the goats). Behind the sheep stands a red angel, and behind the damned is a blue angel. Both angels wear halos, a device originally seen as a symbol of power, but not necessarily of sanctity. The blue figure may be Lucifer, the fallen angel later known as Satan. Unlike later depictions, he is beautiful and radiant—not the horned, hoofed, red monster of later depictions. The color of the holy kingdom in the sixth century, red became associated with hellfire and the devil in later centuries.In the New Testament Satan has become a force of evil. He tempts Jesus to abandon his mission: “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me” (Matthew 4:9). He is described as a hunter of souls: The First Epistle of Peter warns: “Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour” (I Peter 5:8). By the Book of Revelation, Satan has become an apocalyptic beast, determined to overthrow god and heaven.The two devils of the Old and New Testaments are first connected in the Vulgate, a fourth-century A.D. translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin. Isaiah 14 refers to an earthly king as Lucifer, meaning “bearer of light,” who falls from heaven. Echoing Isaiah’s image, Jesus says in Luke 10:18: “I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning.” At the dawn of the Middle Ages in the fifth century, authors began to apply the Vulgate term for Isaiah’s Lucifer to the rebellious angel leader in the Book of Revelation, cast into the pit along with his evil minions.Early Christian authors such as St. Augustine regarded the devil as a fallen angel; he was bad for having rebelled against God, but retained his angelic substance, and was not a physical being. When taking a physical form, the devil might choose as undiabolical an aspect as possible—a beautiful woman, for example, or a holy figure—the better to deceive his victim. Many medieval artists, however, in order to drive home their message, presented the devil in as terrifying a form as possible. Here, “The Devil Presenting St. Augustine With the Book of Vices,” a late 15th-century painted panel by Michael Pacher.During the Middle Ages the devil’s appearance changed drastically. A sixth-century mosaic from Basilica of Sant’Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, Italy, shows the Last Judgment, and the satanic figure appears as an ethereal blue angel. This angelic imagery will ultimately be shed in favor of a more demonic appearance.Many of the devil’s animalistic traits can be traced back to influences from earlier religions. One of the first was found in ancient Babylonian texts—wicked demons named Lilitu. These winged female demons flew through the night, seducing men and attacking pregnant women and infants. In the Jewish tradition, this demoness evolved into Lilith, Adam’s first wife. Lilith came to embody lust, rebellion, and ungodliness, traits later linked to the Christian devil. Another ancient deity who became associated with Satan was Beelzebub, which translates roughly to “Lord of the Flies.” Beelzebub was a Canaanite deity, named in the Old Testament as a false idol that the Hebrews must shun.Classical influences also played a role in the development of the Christian ­devil. As Christianity took root in the Roman world, early worshipers rejected pagan gods and believed them to be evil spirits. Pan, half goat and half man, was a lusty god of nature whose carnal appetites made him easy to associate with the forbidden. His goat horns and cloven hooves became synonymous with sin and would later be adopted by artists in their horrific images of the devil. (See also: Krampus the Christmas devil is coming to more towns. So where's he from?)Reproduced in pictures, from the great artists down to the humble village artisan, a reptilian, winged figure of damnation became the iconic devil figure. Artists like Giotto and Fra Angelico often depicted the devil in paintings of the Last Judgment. In them, a ravenous Satan is seated in the center of hell as he gleefully chomps on the souls of sinners.The devil’s image was further reflected in one of the world’s most influential literary works: Dante’s Inferno, published in the early 14th century as part of the Divine Comedy. Dante describes the deepest regions of hell where Satan holds sway. The devil has three faces and “At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching / A sinner . . . / So that he three of them tormented thus.” Satan bears “mighty wings . . . / No feathers had they, but as of a bat.”Early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico offers a vivid insight into visions of hell in his circa 1431 painting “The Last Judgment," a detail of which is shown above. Armed with spears and spikes, demons shepherd all the damned—bishops and peasants, men and women—into hell for eternity. Most artists depict in great detail the punishments awaiting them: Stripped naked, their souls are tormented, whether bound by serpents, burned by fire, swallowing molten gold, or tearing each other apart. Common to many of these types of paintings is the central, monstrous figure of Satan who savagely devours the condemned. Fra Angelico’s work is no exception: His Satan appears at the base of the painting, chewing on the damned while sitting in a cauldron filled with body parts and stirred by demons.Theologically, the idea of the devil changed during this period as well. His role in the early Middle Ages was much like his role in the Old Testament: He was an adversary but not an ­active enemy. Throughout the Middle Ages Satan evolved into an aggressive, malignant force set on tormenting as many human souls as possible.The Greek daimon—a spirit or minor divinity who engaged with humans—informed a key aspect of this new devil. From the third century A.D., a mystical philosophy known as Neoplatonism incorporated theurgy, invoking daimons to request favors. Neoplatonism was not wholly incompatible with Christianity, but communicating with spirits was. Rituals could not sway the Christian God into granting human wishes; prayers were only evidence of piety. If daimons were indeed doing a person’s bidding, they had to be in league with Satan, who “helped” mortals to deceive them and cause their downfall.Some insights into the rituals of the medieval necromancer can be gleaned through the manuals that they used. The best known are those that passed on the supposed magic powers of the biblical king Solomon.The Key of Solomon (Clavicula Salomonis) is generally agreed to be a 14th-century work that contains invocations to demons imploring them for power. The text includes blasphemous supplications to God asking that the demons obey. In the section entitled “The Prayer,” the necromancer is instructed to intone: “Here ye, and be ye ready, in whatever part of the Universe ye may be, to obey the voice of God, the Mighty One, and the names of the Creator. We let you know by this signal and sound that ye will be convoked hither . . . to obey our commands.” This being done, let the Master complete his work, renew the Circle, and make the incensements and fumigations.As more ancient works were translated into Latin throughout the Middle Ages, a new movement, Scholasticism, tried to reconcile the teachings of the early church with pagan writings on science, philosophy, and even necromancy, the art of conjuring spirits and demons. Necromancers were courting damnation through exposure to demons. In 1326 Pope John XXII issued a bull, Super illius specula, which stated that anyone found guilty of engaging in necromancy could be condemned for heresy and burnt at the stake.During the 14th century Europe faced a dark period blighted by the Black Death, famine, and war. Fear of the devil and his influence increased, as evidenced by an explosion of witch hunts. Unlike necromancers, the church believed that the devil sought out women as partners; witches would sign pacts and engage in evil on his behalf. People were no longer seen as merely deceived by Satan, but in active collusion with him against God. By this time in European history, the devil no longer sat passively. Taking an active role, Satan is present in the world, stealing souls and recruiting people to do his bidding.Marina Montesano is professor of Medieval history at the University of Messina, Italy.",
"Previously hidden text on a 500-year old map reveals new clues about the cartographer’s sources and its influences on important maps that came later.This 1491 map is the best surviving map of the world as Christopher Columbus knew it as he made his first voyage across the Atlantic. In fact, Columbus likely used a copy of it in planning his journey.The map, created by the German cartographer Henricus Martellus, was originally covered with dozens of legends and bits of descriptive text, all in Latin. Most of it has faded over the centuries.But now researchers have used modern technology to uncover much of this previously illegible text. In the process, they’ve discovered new clues about the sources Martellus used to make his map and confirmed the huge influence it had on later maps, including a famous 1507 map by Martin Waldseemuller that was the first to use the name “America.”Contrary to popular myth, 15th-century Europeans did not believe that Columbus would sail off the edge of a flat Earth, says Chet Van Duzer, the map scholar who led the study. But their understanding of the world was quite different from ours, and Martellus’s map reflects that.Its depiction of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea is more or less accurate, or at least recognizable. But southern Africa is oddly shaped like a boot with its toe pointing to the east, and Asia is also twisted out of shape. The large island in the South Pacific roughly where Australia can actually be found must have been a lucky guess, Van Duzer says, as Europeans wouldn’t discover that continent for another century. Martellus filled the southern Pacific Ocean with imaginary islands, apparently sharing the common mapmakers’ aversion to empty spaces.Another quirk of Martellus’s geography helps tie his map to Columbus’s journey: the orientation of Japan. At the time the map was created, Europeans knew Japan existed, but knew very little about its geography. Marco Polo’s journals, the best available source of information about East Asia at the time, had nothing to say about the island’s orientation.Martellus’s map shows it running north-south. Correct, but almost certainly another lucky guess says Van Duzer, as no other known map of the time shows Japan unambiguously oriented this way. Columbus’s son Ferdinand later wrote that his father believed Japan to be oriented north-south, indicating that he very likely used Martellus’s map as a reference.When Columbus made landfall in the West Indies on October 12, 1492, he began looking for Japan, still believing that he’d achieved his goal of finding a route to Asia. He was likely convinced Japan must be near because he’d travelled roughly the same distance that Martellus’s map suggests lay between Europe and Japan, Van Duzer argues in a new book detailing his findings.Van Duzer says it’s reasonable to speculate that as Columbus sailed down the coast of Central and South America on later voyages, he pictured himself sailing down the coast of Asia as depicted on Martellus’s map.The map is roughly 3.5 by 6 feet. Such a large map would have been a luxury object, likely commissioned by a member of the nobility, but there’s no shield or dedication to indicate who that might have been. It was donated anonymously to Yale University in 1962 and remains in the university’s Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library.Over time, much of the text had faded to almost perfectly match the background, making it impossible to read. But in 2014 Van Duzer won a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities that allowed him and a team of collaborators to use a technique called multispectral imaging to try to uncover the hidden text.The method involved taking many hundreds of photographs of the map with different wavelengths of light and processing the images to find the combination of wavelengths that best improves legibility on each part of the map (you can play around with an interactive map created by one of Van Duzer’s colleagues here).Many of the map legends describe the regions of the world and their inhabitants. “Here are found the Hippopodes: they have a human form but the feet of horses,” reads one previously illegible text over Central Asia. Another describes “monsters similar to humans whose ears are so large that they can cover their whole body.” Many of these fantastical creatures can be traced to texts written by the ancient Greeks.The most surprising revelation, however, was in the interior of Africa, Van Duzer says. Martellus included many details and place names that appear to trace back to an Ethiopian delegation that visited Florence in 1441. Van Duzer says he knows of no other 15th-century European map that has this much information about the geography of Africa, let alone information derived from native Africans instead of European explorers. “I was blown away,” he says.The imaging also strengthens the case that Martellus’s map was a major source for two even more famous cartographic objects: the oldest surviving terrestrial globe, created by Martin Behaim in 1492, and Martin Waldseemuller’s 1507 world map, the first to apply the label “America” to the continents of the western hemisphere. (The Library of Congress purchased Waldseemuller’s map for a record $10 million in 2003.)Waldseemuller liberally copied text from Martellus, Van Duzer found after comparing the two maps. The practice was common in those days—in fact, Martellus himself apparently copied the sea monsters on his map from an encyclopedia published in 1491, an observation that helps date the map.Despite their commonalities, the maps by Martellus and Waldseemuller have one glaring difference. Martellus depicts Europe and Africa nearly at the left edge of his map, with only water beyond. Waldseemuller’s map extends further to the west and depicts new lands on the other side of the Atlantic. Only 16 years had passed between the making of the two maps, but the world had changed forever.Greg Miller and Betsy Mason are authors of the forthcoming illustrated book from National Geographic, All Over the Map.

"Returning to the Alhambra is like rereading a book. The hilltop citadel built by the Nasrid sultans above Granada, in Spain’s autonomous Andalusia region, was a masterpiece of medieval engineering, but also of literature—poetry and philosophy expressed in dream-like architecture. Verses, blessings, and ruminations were etched into its facades so the structure would seem to speak.“The perpetual bliss, the continual ecstasy…” runs one long strand around the reflecting pool of the Comares Palace. “Be sparing with your words, and you’ll go in peace” advises the inner wall above the sultan’s throne. Above, a domed roof composed of more than 8,000 pieces of wood and inlaid with a constellation of stars represents all seven heavens of Islamic cosmology.The grand, medieval Alhambra palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, sets the tone in this historic city awash with traditions—one of Nat Geo’s Best of the World destinations. But while one foot is in the past, the other is tapping out a modern beat. Besides its history of flamenco singing and dancing, Granada is a European hub for the reigning hip-hop subgenre of trap music. It’s a university town, forever replenished by students, a place where ultra-traditional tapas bars share bustling streets with contemporary fusion restaurants.Founded in the 11th century, Granada was a flourishing Moorish stronghold until it fell to Ferdinand II and Isabella I’s Catholic rule in 1492. In the ensuing years, Muslims and Jews were forced into the Albaicín, a neighborhood north of the Alhambra.In modern times, the medieval Muslim quarter has preserved its sideways maze of whitewashed houses, spilling down the hillside on zigzagging narrow lanes. Indeed, there’s an edge-of-the-world appeal to the cafes and tapas bars that hang over the switchbacks and stairways that offer breathtaking views of the Alhambra.It’s still possible to feel the passage of centuries through atavistic portals like El Bañuelo, the bunker-like remains of an 11th-century hammam bathhouse. Later Catholic monarchs saw to the destruction of many similar spas, equating them with sin. Thankfully this one survived and lives on as a small museum.The king and queen who reconquered Spain and sent Christopher Columbus to the New World are buried together in the Royal Chapel of the Cathedral of Santa María de la Encarnación. Here, one of many Catholic sanctuaries that sprouted up during the couple’s reign, a gloomy mood of gothic romance prevails around their sculpted tombs.Walking around the historic core, visitors find other famous figures, including Federico García Lorca. Born in Granada and executed with one of the first shots fired in the Spanish Civil War, the poet is still mourned like a favorite son around this city. Guided tours of his family’s summer house, Huerta de San Vicente, take visitors through his life and work. The park outside—formerly an orchard—is a fine place to read a few of his lines.(This off-the-beaten-track Belgian city is where the Big Bang theory was born.)Spain’s small-plate dining culture began in this region, and Granada’s hostelries can be absurdly generous in observing the local custom of free tapas with every alcoholic drink. The shortest glass of beer may come with a pork loin sandwich the size of your face. Hitting a few bars around Realejo or Plaza Nueva will leave you as stuffed and stunned as repeat trips to a wedding buffet.In the glut of tapas bars, La Trastienda keeps a low profile, tucked behind the counter of a butcher shop. In 1836, the owner started feeding cold cuts to hungry customers in the queue. Today’s fare is still premium-grade cured meats and smoked cheeses.A little outside the old town’s culinary comfort zone of ham, lamb, and razor clams, Restaurante Cala is where the tapas-weary go for variety. In a bright, modern dining room, French-born chef Samuel Hernández makes a broadly Mediterranean menu more cosmopolitan by way of tiger milk, aguachile verde, and hoisin sauce.Traditional carmen (traditional-style houses) scatter the Albaicín, garden vineyards and orchards growing over their high white walls. Topmost among them is Las Tomasas, which offers a triumphant view of the Alhambra. The food here is built on regional and national staples from baby squid to bull’s tail.In this Spanish town, tapas go hand in hand not only with sherry but also cocktails. A relic of the Civil War era, Bodegas Castañeda is stacked with load-bearing bottles and barrels full of local wines and sherries, but the house special is calicasas—a homemade doozy concocted from vermouth, gin, rum, soda, and spices.Tragofino-SanMatías 30 is a relatively young and cool alternative to Granada’s antique taverns. It also stands out for its superior take on the pomegranate cocktails served all over town. Here, it’s made with fresh pulp and Pama liqueur and served in a jam jar.(A new generation of pastis makers infuses France’s national aperitif with new life.)Flamenco was born in Andalusia, about a millennium ago, and has evolved into a semi-improvised art form of percussive footwork, plaintive singing, and flurries of acoustic guitar. The question of the most “authentic” venue in Granada is still the subject of furious debate among local aficionados.Popular cave bars like Cueva de la Rocío in the Sacromonte neighborhood can amplify the style’s explosive tempos, but the sounds and colors also whirl in airier settings like Jardines de Zoraya, a conjoined flamenco stage and garden restaurant forming a world-class tablao venue for dinner and a show.These days Granada’s music scene is fed by students and immigrants from across Europe, North Africa, and Latin America. As a result, you’ll hear plenty of genres just walking around—cellists from the Superior Royal Conservatory of Music Victoria Eugenia de Granada practicing in a plaza or Balkan accordion ballads bleeding into French rap battles at jam sessions outside Huerto de Carlos garden.The city’s genre-blurring club culture is further melted down at Boogaclub, a small and beloved dance venue. Hosting regular jazz, reggae, and flamenco sessions, Booga also played a key role in breaking the hip-hop splinter groups who went on to make trap music the crisp, bouncy, auto-tuned sound of the Spanish underground.Venturing outside the city center yields other wonders ripe for exploration. The suburban village of Monachil leads into the Sierra Nevada range by way of an exhilarating trail through the Los Cahorros valley. Long, high, hanging bridges sway dramatically underfoot, and looming canyon walls lean so far over the river that you can only pass by grabbing metal handholds that have been hammered into the rock.A half-hour drive outside the city limits takes travelers to a prehistoric landscape of fossil-rich clay hills. This is the “other Alhambra,” claim promoters of the scrolling geopark around Granada, newly designated by UNESCO as a heritage site.Early Moorish settlers dug subterranean dwellings in that terrain, which were later occupied by people who couldn’t afford to build or buy homes. These dwellings were recently repurposed by operators like Cuevas Almagruz, a family-owned cavern network housing an underground museum and a row of rustic-chic accommodations carved into soft red rock.Hosted in one of these chambers, visitors become a figure in a folk tale for a night. They sleep and dream in the belly of a mountain, then wake and rise from the mouth of a cave, ready to wander through history in this unique region of southern Spain.Go with Nat Geo: Discover Moorish Spain from Córdoba’s cultures to Granada’s Alhambra to Seville’s wonders on this eight-day National Geographic Expeditions journey.A version of this story first published in the March 2021 issue of National Geographic Traveller (UK).",
"Ready to travel again? Our global editors picked the planet’s 25 most exciting destinations for 2022. Five categories—Nature, Adventure, Sustainability, Culture and History, and Family—frame unforgettable journeys of discovery. This year’s list celebrates a number of World Heritage sites in honor of UNESCO’s 50 years of helping to safeguard cultural and natural treasures. Although the pandemic changed when, where, and how we travel, we are eager to unleash our wanderlust—and see what wonders we’ll uncover.Help save a natural wonder. Baikal is so vast and deep, many locals call it a sea. Covering some 12,200 square miles and with an average depth of 2,442 feet, the massive lake is a natural wonder. It’s also in serious trouble. Despite being named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996, Lake Baikal has experienced ongoing pollution, the recent weakening of government protections, and new threats, such as large-scale tourism development. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature deemed the lake’s environmental World Heritage Outlook of “significant concern” in 2020.Visitors can help safeguard the lake and its varied landscapes—including tundra, steppe, boreal forest, and virgin beaches—by volunteering with Great Baikal Trail Association, the nonprofit environmental group creating a hiking route around the lake. “Volunteering helps protect Lake Baikal nature by developing ecotourism infrastructure,” says association president Elena Chubakova.Hiking the trail is a planet-friendly way to spot some of the 1,200 Lake Baikal plant and animal species found nowhere else on Earth, such as the nerpa, the world’s only exclusively freshwater seal. —Victoria Meleshko, National Geographic Traveler RussiaDiscover the next great safari. Namibia evokes images of deserts, immense dunes, and parched mountains. But the Caprivi Strip, a narrow finger of land that juts out toward the east in the extreme north of the country, is a green, wildlife-rich territory. The presence of the Okavango, Kwando, Chobe, and Zambezi Rivers creates an ideal habitat for numerous animal species.During the second half of the 20th century, the area was the scene of intense military activity. Remote and difficult to access, it was a prime corridor for various armed groups. After Namibia gained independence in 1990, peace—and wildlife—gradually returned.In the eastern section of the region, Nkasa Rupara National Park is a secret jewel. A ranger station and tented lodge that opened in recent years have made it more accessible to tourism, but it’s still seldom visited. Encompassed by the Kwando-Linyanti River system to the south and by swamps and lagoons to the north, Nkasa Rupara is Namibia’s largest protected wetland. It’s described as a “mini Okavango,” as its floodwaters mirror Botswana’s more famous Okavango Delta. The park is home to the largest population of buffalo in Namibia. Predators include lions, leopards, and hyenas, while crocodiles and hippos abound in the river.Mahango Game Park, in the west, includes wetlands and mopane forests. Here roam large herds of elephants, hippos, crocodiles, and nearly all the antelope species of Namibia, including the elusive semiaquatic sitatunga. Go with Nat Geo: See otherworldly landscapes and seek out endangered black rhinos in Namibia. —Marco Cattaneo, National Geographic Traveler ItalyDrive the Great Ocean Road. Green shoots of regeneration are popping up across Australia, where the 2019-2020 bushfires burned some 72,000 square miles of land. The disasters led to the deaths of nearly three dozen people and more than a billion animals.Playing its own role in these rejuvenation efforts, Wildlife Wonders, in Victoria’s Otways region, is a new wildlife sanctuary tucked away off the Great Ocean Road amid lush ancient forest and waterfalls. It’s the brainchild of Brian Massey, the landscape designer of New Zealand’s Hobbiton movie set tours. Massey, along with botanists, scientists, zoologists, and environmental specialists, has crafted a sinuous wooden path that winds through the refuge and blends seamlessly into the landscape.Visitors can set off on 75-minute guided tours of the sylvan site, wandering through thickets of eucalyptus trees and admiring the koalas, wallabies, and bandicoots that now call the sanctuary home. During a stop at the Research Base, guests can learn more about how the site provides a safe space for native species like the long-nosed potoroo, a marsupial that often falls prey to invasive predators such as foxes and cats.All profits from Wildlife Wonders go toward the Conservation Ecology Centre, which helps to fund several vital conservation projects in the Otways, including one that studies the movement of potoroos before, during, and after planned forest fires. —Connor McGovern, National Geographic Traveller UKPeek at tropical wildlife. The race to preserve one of the largest remaining tropical rainforests in the Americas got a big boost recently. In April 2021, a coalition of conservation partners, led by the Nature Conservancy, purchased 236,000 acres of tropical forest in northwestern Belize to create the Belize Maya Forest Reserve. Along with saving some of the most biodiverse forests in the world from denuding and development, the new protected area—which is contiguous with the neighboring Rio Bravo Conservation Management Area (RBCMA)—closes a huge gap in a vital wildlife corridor that runs from southeast Mexico through Guatemala and into Belize.The combined reserve, which protects nearly a tenth of Belize’s land area, safeguards and connects essential habitats for an amazing variety of endemic and endangered wild things. These include the tapir, Belize’s national animal; black howler monkeys; more than 400 species of birds; and some of Central America’s largest surviving populations of jaguar. For now, ecotourism activities are based in the more established RBCMA, which has two rustic lodges and offers guided expeditions. Go with Nat Geo: Take a private tour of the Maya ruins of Tikal, Guatemala, and the cays of Belize.Turn off the lights. Thousands upon thousands of stars dazzle above northern Minnesota. This remote region bordering the Canadian province of Ontario has little to no light pollution, and residents are determined to keep it that way.The Heart of the Continent Dark Sky Initiative is a cross-border effort underway to create one of the largest dark-sky destinations on the planet. Two of its biggest pieces are in Minnesota: Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the world’s largest International Dark Sky Sanctuary at more than a million acres, and neighboring Voyageurs National Park, the state’s first International Dark Sky Park. Both wild places received dark-sky certification in 2020, and Ontario’s Quetico Provincial Park, which adjoins the wilderness area, earned International Dark Sky Park status in early 2021.(Here’s how to see auroras—from the Great Lakes.)“The preservation of darkness at places like Voyageurs National Park not only provides wondrous views and ecological benefits to wildlife,” says Christina Hausman Rhode, executive director of the nonprofit Voyageurs Conservancy. “It also allows us a window to the past; to see the skies as they were hundreds of years ago, used for navigation and storytelling by peoples like the voyageurs of the fur trade and the Indigenous Ojibwe.”Climb the Rockies. For unparalleled views of the Continental Divide, one must climb hand over foot up North America’s highest via ferrata. Arapahoe Basin’s “iron way”—a climbing route comprising metal rungs and cables—begins at the base of granite Rocky Mountain cliffs and ascends nearly 1,200 feet to a 13,000-foot summit.A glance below reveals a weathered Colorado landscape dotted with green moss and pink and purple flora, and rock gardens created by the cliffs themselves, the fallen chunks varying in size from pebbles to Volkswagens. The thin air is occasionally punctuated by the shrill peep of a marmot or pika.Even those without prior rock-climbing experience can scale the cliffs with a guide, using the metal rungs while also gripping the rock or wedging a foot into a crack for leverage. To avoid what could be a thousand-foot plunge to certain death, climbers must clip their harnesses from one cable to the next as they go. The route is entirely exposed and thunderstorms can roll in suddenly.From the cliffs above, high-alpine mountain goats are often stoic observers, but typically disappear as travelers reach the summit. This marks the halfway point. From here, climbers must also descend, which, for via ferrata first-timers like Michael Lytle, can be the most harrowing part of the journey.“You try not to look all the way down. The highway looks like a piece of thread from up there,” Lytle says. “The fear factor is real.”Swim with sharks. When you arrive here, the stamp in your passport will include the Palau Pledge, which all visitors must sign, promising that “the only footprints I shall leave are those that will wash away.” The 59-word eco-pledge was drafted by and for the children of this remote western Pacific archipelago to help protect Palau’s culture and environment from the negative impacts of tourism.Eighty percent of the nation’s waters—recognized by National Geographic’s Pristine Seas project as one of the richest marine ecosystems on the planet—is preserved as the Palau National Marine Sanctuary. At 183,000 square miles, the no-take sanctuary is one of the world’s largest protected marine areas, safeguarding some 700 species of coral and more than 1,300 species of fish, including a dazzling variety of sharks.“From the air, Palau looks like paradise on earth,” says Pristine Seas founder and National Geographic Explorer in Residence Enric Sala. “When you get underwater, you’re transported to a different world.”During the 20th annual Shark Week Palau, from February 27 to March 6, 2022, divers can observe and participate in citizen science–assisted counts of numerous shark species, such as grey reef, blacktip, blue, tiger, and hammerhead. Daily dive sites are chosen for their abundant sharks and other marine life, including large aggregations of manta rays and thousands of spawning fish.Snorkelers can join a February or November Oceanic Society tour of the UNESCO World Heritage–listed Rock Islands Southern Lagoon, home to reef sharks, dugongs, giant clams, and marine lakes teeming with millions of golden jellyfish. Go with Nat Geo: Discover the undersea wonders of Palau on this snorkel and kayak tour. —National Geographic Traveller IndiaCycle a new bike trail. La Seine à Vélo is a new cycling trail worthy of painter Claude Monet, whose house and famous water lilies in Giverny are on the route. But the 270-mile Paris-to-the-sea path, opened in October 2020, offers lesser known masterpieces too, such as the colorful street art that brightens the Canal Saint-Denis in Paris.On the trail’s 15 stages, bikers pass through protected natural areas, including Normandy’s Grande Noé Bird Reserve, located along a major migratory flyway. While rolling across Normandy, they can visit the ruins of Jumièges Abbey, founded in 654, and take a Benedictine monk–led tour of Abbaye Saint-Wandrille, a centuries-old working abbey. The tearoom and gardens of Château de Bizy, a royal residence built in 1740 and inspired by Versailles, offer a respite off two wheels.While Monet isn’t the only reason to ride the trail, pedal-pushers who love paintings should allow extra time for the Giverny Museum of Impressionism, which explores the revolutionary 19th-century art movement. —Gabriel Joseph-Dezaize, National Geographic Traveler FranceTackle a backcountry trail. A turtle-shaped rock near Nepisiguit Falls, in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, carries with it a legend told by the Mi’gmaq people (also spelled Mi’kmaq). When water levels drop, the “turtle,” named Egomoqaseg, or “rock like a moving ship,” appears to be climbing up out of the river, says trail master Jason Grant, whose father-in-law, Mi’gmaq elder Gilbert Sewell, was a keeper of the story.“Legend goes, once the turtle is completely out of the water, it will be the end of the world for the Mi’gmaq people,” says Grant. Based on his annual visits to the rock, Grant adds, Egomoqaseg has a long way to go before reaching dry ground.The falls are a stop along a millennia-old First Nations migration route that has been developed into the longest backcountry hiking trail in the Canadian Maritimes. Running 93 miles along the Nepisiguit River, the rugged Sentier Nepisiguit Mi’gmaq Trail follows ancient portage pathways used by the nomadic Mi’gmaq.The route begins at sea level at Daly Point Nature Reserve in Bathurst and ends at Bathurst Lake in Mount Carleton Provincial Park, home to 2,690-foot-tall Mount Carleton, the highest peak in the Maritimes. To promote respect for the relevance of the trail to the Mi’gmaq people, the route’s restoration, completed in 2018, included incorporating Mi’gmaq language and culture, such as teepee campsites and a turtle logo inspired by Egomoqaseg.Trek from sea to sea. Stretching across Costa Rica from the Caribbean to the Pacific, El Camino de Costa Rica is a 174-mile-long window into life far off the well-trod tourist path. The 16-stage hiking route primarily follows public roads as it passes through remote villages and towns, Indigenous Cabecar lands, and protected natural areas.It’s designed to spark economic activity in rural districts. Local families, nonprofits, and a network of micro-entrepreneurs, such as Ecomiel honey producers, the woman-owned Finca El Casquillo organic farm, and La Cabaña sustainable coffee micro-mill, provide most of the trail’s lodging, food, tours, and other hiker amenities.Due to the trail’s remoteness and its patchwork of tourism services, Mar a Mar (Sea to Sea)—the nonprofit partnership formed in 2016 to develop, promote, and help sustain El Camino—strongly recommends hiking with a guide. Ticos a Pata, UrriTrek Costa Rica, and ViaLig Journeys are among the tour operators offering guided experiences—from single-day hikes to coast-to-coast treks with multiple river crossings and rambles through ranch lands, rainforests, cloud forests, and sugarcane plantations. Multiday itineraries typically feature optional adventures, such as a white-water rafting trip on the world-class Pacuare River rapids. —National Geographic Traveler KoreaFight for the forest. In recognition of the global importance of the Amazon, France is leading the fight against deforestation in eastern Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park, designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1989. The almost 4,000-square-mile park—home to mahogany trees, sweet guabas, anthuriums, palms, and hypnotizingly green ferns—is the first of five pilot sites in the French-funded TerrAmaz program. This four-year initiative, launched in late 2020, supports sustainable development and safeguards biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.Yasuní—considered one of the most biodiverse places on Earth—shelters an astonishing assortment of creatures, such as anteaters, capybaras, sloths, spider monkeys, and about 600 species of colorful birds. In the Napo and Curaray rivers flanking the park, visitors can watch for the Amazon river dolphin, an endangered and enigmatic species.Yasuní also provides refuge for the Tagaeri and Taromenane people, Waorani Indigenous groups who live in voluntary isolation and use handcrafted canoes to travel between waterways. Tour operators such as Napo Wildlife Center offer excursions and lodging based on a sustainable ecotourism model that benefits the resident tribes. —Karen Alfaro, National Geographic Traveler Latin AmericaWitness a conservation success. “Chimanimani is a timeless place, where local rainmakers still climb peaks to summon rain,” says National Geographic Explorer and photojournalist Jen Guyton, of one of Mozambique’s newest national parks. Located on the country’s mountainous border with Zimbabwe, Chimanimani National Park, established in October 2020, is home to Mozambique’s highest peak, Mount Binga (elevation: 7,992 feet). It was once flush with elephants, lions, and other large animals whose images appear in ancient rock art created by the ancestral San people.Poaching during decades of civil unrest decimated wildlife populations, but small numbers of elephants remain, as do at least 42 other species of mammals and a dazzling variety of plant and avian life. In the two recent biodiversity surveys alone that Guyton photographed, 475 plant species and 260 bird species were identified, along with 67 amphibian and reptile species—including one frog and one lizard thought to be new to science.(How one of Africa’s great parks is rebounding from war.)Sustainable tourism activities—such as birdwatching, hiking to forest waterfalls, and overnighting at the Ndzou Camp, a small community ecolodge—provide up-close views of a captivating wild place, which Guyton particularly enjoys experiencing at sunset. “With no roads for miles around, there’s total silence except for the birds, and you get a few moments of almost transcendental peace in that warm glow.”Get creative. Mining and steel production once dominated the densely populated Ruhr Valley, located in Germany’s western state of North Rhine–Westphalia. Today, the region is repurposing former slag heaps (mounds of mining waste) and postapocalyptic-looking industrial sites as parks and open-air cultural spaces.The most famous is the World Heritage site of Zeche Zollverein (Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex), home to an outdoor swimming pool, ice rink, and walking trails. “People visiting the Ruhr area are usually impressed by the abundance of green,” says Karola Geiss-Netthöfel, director of the Ruhr Regional Association.Zollverein is part of the wider Emscher Landscape Park, an east-west system of green spaces and corridors covering nearly 175 square miles. Rent a bike in Essen for a car-free Ruhr Valley trip along cycling routes, many of which follow former railway tracks. Or explore on foot via the 96-mile-long Hohe Mark Steig, a trekking trail opened in 2021.“The trail combines nature and industrial culture in a unique way, as you pass by several industrial buildings,” says Geiss-Netthöfel. A top spot nearby: Halde Hoheward, elevation 495 feet, a mountainous slag heap made from 180 million tons of mine waste and topped with a giant sundial. —Franziska Haack, National Geographic Traveler GermanyWine and dine mindfully. The nation’s largest National Scenic Area is probably not where you think it is. It straddles the Oregon-Washington border and comprises 293,000 acres of public and private lands along the Columbia River Gorge.With Mount Hood nearby, the area attracts more than two million visitors annually. A nonprofit alliance is helping to reduce tourist impact on local nature and culture. This collaboration has become a model for other regions building a sustainable tourism economy.Columbia Gorge Tourism Alliance initiatives include the visitor education program Ready, Set, Gorge, and the East Gorge Food Trail, a network of farms, historic hotels, wineries, and other homegrown experiences. Partnering with other local organizations and educating visitors benefits everyone, says Ali McLaughlin, owner of MountNbarreL, which offers wine-tasting bike tours and other car-free experiences.“Having tourists who understand the importance of respecting the area they are traveling through has gone a long way toward mitigating concerns from local residents,” says McLaughlin. Go with Nat Geo: Retrace the path of Lewis and Clark’s trailblazing expedition through the Pacific Northwest.Spotlight a green city. Named a UNESCO City of Film in 2017 for its rich cinematic culture, Łódź, a city of nearly 700,000 in central Poland, was a major textile manufacturing center in the 19th and 20th centuries. Now Poland’s Hollywood is flipping the script on its industrial past to create a greener future.In recent years Łódź  (pronounced woodge) has embraced new ecological technologies, such as using pre-RDF (refuse-derived fuel) and biomass energy to heat homes. In 2021, the city partnered with the European e-commerce delivery platform InPost to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions and traffic in the town’s center by installing 70 parcel locker locations and electric car charging stations.Nearly a third of Łódź is green space, ranging from new pocket parks to the 2,977-acre Łagiewnicki Forest. In the city’s old industrial areas, factories are being reborn as parks, cultural centers, residences, and retail spaces. The trendiest spot on the cultural map is OFF Piotrkowska, a buzzing art, design, dining, and club district housed in a former cotton mill.Another massive factory, built by the I.K. Poznański Cotton Products Company—which employed as many as 7,000 people in 1913—was reimagined as Manufaktura, an arts center and shopping mall spread across 13 historic brick buildings. Manufaktura’s Muzeum Fabryki explores the Poznański family’s “cotton empire” and the lives of the factory workers. —Martyna Szczepanik, National Geographic Traveler PolandTaste tea. One of the oldest cultural landscapes in China is slated to become one of the country’s newest UNESCO World Heritage sites in 2022. The Ancient Tea Plantations of Jingmai Mountain in Pu’er, which collectively form the world’s largest ancient artificially cultivated tea plantation, features about 1.13 million tea trees, the oldest of which is 1,400 years old.Located in the remote southwestern corner of China’s Yunnan Province, the region was a starting point of the legendary Ancient Tea Horse Road. This 11th-century network of routes was named for its primary purpose: trading Chinese tea for Tibetan horses (130 pounds of tea equaled the value of one horse).(In search of the perfect cup of tea in China’s Yunnan Province.)Today, new highways have replaced the route, but the region’s tea plantations remain, as do the four local ethnic minority groups—the Blang, Dai, Hani, and Wa people—who retain their own languages, customs, and festivals. The remote location and limited tea-tourism offerings make a guided trip the best way to experience this enduring cultural landscape. —Yi Lu, National Geographic Traveler ChinaLearn about an island’s roots. Most visitors to Hokkaido, Japan’s wildly scenic and northernmost main island, don’t have many opportunities to learn about the Ainu, Indigenous people from the northern region of the archipelago. But the new National Ainu Museum and Park at Upopoy, which opened in 2020, hopes to change that. It joins the Kayano Shigeru Nibutani Ainu Museum, which opened in 1992, in teaching Japanese and international visitors about Ainu culture.Marginalized since the late 1800s, the Ainu were granted legal protections in Japan in 2019; the country’s new Ainu Promotion Act recognizes and bans discrimination against the Ainu.Upopoy has a pressing three-pronged mission: promote, revitalize, and expand Ainu culture before it becomes extinct. Particularly at risk is the Ainu language, which is unrelated to Japanese or any other language, and is considered critically endangered by UNESCO. Listening to conversational Ainu and playing games to learn pronunciation are part of the new museum’s permanent exhibition.Visitors can also discover the timely sustainable-living lessons of the Ainu, whose spiritual beliefs are rooted in respect and gratitude for nature. After visiting Upopoy, drive 30 minutes southwest and soak in nature at Noboribetsu Onsen, Hokkaido’s premier hot springs resort which is located in Shikotsu-Toya National Park. Go with Nat Geo: Take a voyage in the Ring of Fire aboard the National Geographic Resolution.Connect with culture. Chosen pre-pandemic, the theme of Procida’s reign as the Italian Capital of Culture 2022—La cultura non isola (Culture does not isolate)—now seems particularly on point. The island city, located 40 minutes southwest of Naples via high-speed ferry, plans to use its year in the spotlight to illustrate the importance of culture, particularly in times of uncertainty.“Today, ‘Culture does not isolate’ is an even stronger call to action because, for us, the island is a metaphor for modern people,” says Procida 2022 director Agostino Riitano. “We are all like islands, creating our own archipelagos where culture has to be the mortar that holds them together; this is even more true following the effects of the pandemic.”(The pandemic couldn’t silence this Italian city of music.)Procida 2022 plans to spread cultural programming, such as contemporary art exhibitions, festivals, and performances, over 300 days to encourage responsible travel throughout the year, and to avoid a mass influx of visitors during the summer. In the spotlight as a symbol of the inclusive theme is the island’s Palazzo d’Avalos, a Renaissance palace-turned-prison, built in 1500 and closed in 1988. Most recently associated with isolation, the former prison and its green space (where inmates raised crops, cows, and pigs) will be reborn as a cultural venue and urban park.Meet the moment. At a time when voting rights are in contention in the United States, Atlanta is flexing its cultural and political muscle through two formidable voter empowerment organizations: The New Georgia Project and Fair Fight Action, both founded by Atlanta-based political leader and activist Stacey Abrams.Being at the forefront of social change isn’t new, says city native Bem Joiner, cofounder of the creative agency Atlanta Influences Everything. “Atlanta’s ‘special sauce’ is its three C’s: civic, corporate, and cultural. We’re the cradle of the civil rights movement, the home of Coca-Cola, and our hip-hop culture shapes global culture. There’s no place else quite like Atlanta.”Georgia’s largest city is also an epicenter of Black entrepreneurship, incubating businesses such as plant-based burger chain Slutty Vegan and eco-conscious Sustainable Home Goods.Easily accessible on foot or by bike via the BeltLine’s Eastside Trail, the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood blends nightlife and dining venues, such as Biggerstaff Brewing Company and Ponce City Market, with historic highlights like the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park and the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum.Sing along. Despite pushback from punk and rock purists, the remix of Denmark Street, former hub of the British music industry, promises to hit all the right notes. Once lined with music publishers, recording studios, rehearsal rooms, and dimly lit clubs, the tiny street, nicknamed London’s Tin Pan Alley, helped launch the British punk rock movement and legends including David Bowie, Elton John, and the Rolling Stones.In recent years, the music had all but died, save for Denmark Street’s surviving guitar shops. Now this iconic slice of history is being revived as part of Outernet London, the West End’s new $1.2 billion entertainment district.The retooled street retains pieces of its storied past: restored 17th-century building facades; the heritage-protected graffiti art of Johnny Rotten, lead singer of the Sex Pistols (who lived here); the old-school music shops (thanks to affordable, long-term leases).(Learn more about the unlikely rebirth of a London legend.)It also welcomes new spaces for infusing with music. There are busker spots where street musicians can make their case for being the next Adele (who debuted at Denmark Street’s original 12 Bar Club); a free-to-use professional-quality recording studio for up-and-coming artists; and the new Chateau Denmark hotel, spread across 16 buildings steeped in music history.Learn about nomadic life. The nomadic Yörüks, originally from different Turkic groups that ranged from the Balkans to Iran, once roamed the plateaus of the Turkish riviera. Most of the Yörüks (literally “walkers”) have now settled down—but many of their thousand-year-old customs are alive and well.Located in the historical Lycia region in southwestern Anatolia, Teke Peninsula is one of the spots where Yörük culture remains strong. Teke Yörüks live a semi-nomadic life with their tents, kilim rugs, herds, shepherd dogs, and transhumant traditions, set against a mountainous, Mediterranean backdrop full of olive trees.In recent years, tour companies have started to merge the marvels of Lycia with Yörük life. Families can trek parts of the famous Lycian Way; visit ancient sites like Patara, Xanthos, or Letoon; and swim in crystal clear waters while spending nights in hotels, guesthouses, tents, or villagers’ own homes. But it’s the children who have the most fun, as they can experience Yörük culture by making syrup with pomegranates, cooking local pastries, milking goats, or taking part in the olive harvest.“History, nature, and culture, they’re all here. We wanted to turn this beautiful landscape into a learning platform, but also into a playground,” says Kerem Karaerkek, the chief guide of Middle Earth Travel. “I love how the kids get excited when they step into a Yörük kitchen or when they go on a treasure hunt in ancient Lycian ruins. You can see the sense of wonder in their eyes.” —Onur Uygun, National Geographic Traveler TurkeyMarvel at geometric beauty. Built as a palace-city by 13th-century Nasrid sultans—rulers of the longest-lasting and final Muslim dynasty on the Iberian Peninsula—the Alhambra (“red fort”) is considered the Moorish architectural jewel of Europe. The almond-shaped profile of this UNESCO World Heritage site rests on a hill above Granada, one of the most picturesque cities in Spain.But it’s the mathematical wizardry on display here that is particularly fascinating for families. Intricate mosaics, arabesques (a repetitive, stylized pattern based on a floral or vegetal design), and muqarnas (ornamental vaulting) make the Alhambra a masterpiece of geometric beauty—and a colorful classroom for age-appropriate exploration of math concepts, such as shapes, symmetry, proportion, and measurement.Math flows through the Alhambra’s other main design feature, water, which gives life and meaning to the whole. Water provides the refreshing spirit of the gardens and the murmur of its fountains, but is also an element of the architecture itself.At the Palace of the Lions, one of the Alhambra’s three original royal palaces, families will marvel at the central fountain. Its elaborate design features 12 stone lions supporting a large marble basin on their backs and—thanks to the technical wonder of complex hydraulics—spitting water from their mouths.

The history of the Underground Railroad flows through the waterways, wetlands, swamps, and tidal marshes of Dorchester County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. This is where the secret network’s most famous “conductor,” Harriet Tubman, was born enslaved, grew up, and honed the skills—such as trapping, hunting, and using stars to navigate—she used to escape to freedom in Pennsylvania. She then returned 13 times to rescue more than 70 enslaved friends and family. Her heroic story is told at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center, one of the more than 30 stops along the 125-mile Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway.To bring Tubman’s story to life for kids, Alex Green, co-owner of Harriet Tubman Tours, suggests a kayaking adventure in the byway’s Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. As a child, Tubman trapped muskrats here and worked alongside her father, a timber inspector who taught her how to move around the marshlands.“We talk to kids about how the confidence and lessons Harriet learned inside the terrible institution of slavery drove her to accomplish incredible things,” Green says. “Harriet never gave up and she never stopped learning. That’s a lesson they can take home.” Go with Nat Geo: Embark on a wild Chesapeake Bay escape to see waterways, watermen, and wildlife.Cruise storybook lands. Boating the Danube can seem like traveling through a realm of fairy tales, with its scrolling views of castles, medieval towns, and stately palaces that help to bring European history to life. The river twists through 10 European countries (Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine), and most Danube cruise itineraries include stops in at least four of those, with special family sailings featuring kid-friendly onshore activities.School lessons focusing on Middle Ages feudalism take on vivid dimensions when exploring Veste Oberhaus in Passau, Germany, one of the largest surviving castle complexes in Europe. Ages-old Hungarian equestrian traditions come alive on a southern Hungarian ranch, where fearless csikós, or mounted herdsmen, ride standing upright and balancing on the backs of two galloping horses.When off the water, look to wheels. Board Vienna’s iconic Giant Ferris Wheel, the Riesenrad, or take a bike ride among terraced vineyards in Lower Austria’s World Heritage-listed Wachau Cultural Landscape. Go with Nat Geo: Savor Christmas markets from Budapest to Nuremberg on this Danube cruise. —National Geographic Traveler RomaniaDive a longtime marine reserve. Dazzling sunlight, a turquoise sea, palm trees, white beaches, and a laid-back atmosphere: Bonaire checks all the boxes for an idyllic tropical destination. But compared to many other Caribbean islands, Bonaire (pop. 21,000) is quiet and still relatively wild and unspoiled. Off its coast lies one of the oldest marine reserves in the world.The Bonaire National Marine Park was established in 1979 and has been on the provisional UNESCO World Heritage List since 2011. The reserve encompasses 6,672 acres of coral reef, seagrass, and mangrove vegetation. Bonaire’s healthy reefs are a magnet for divers and snorkelers who can spot up to 57 species of coral and more than 350 different fish species.Several dive schools on Bonaire participate in the Reef Renewal program, in which volunteers can grow and maintain corals in underwater nurseries, then plant them into the reef. Anyone who can dive can come and help after completing the PADI Reef Renewal Diver course.(Read more about new efforts to save dying coral reefs.)Accessibility is another bonus: You don’t need a liveaboard or other boat transport to start exploring.

"Lake Baikal is so big it makes its own horizon, one not always visible in winter when the snow and clouds can blend with the lake’s ice, eliminating all perspective from the landscape.But what hope is there for proportion on a lake that holds 20 percent of the world’s (unfrozen) freshwater supply?Never mind how hard it is to see anything through all the layers of clothing you’ll need to endure winter temperatures that regularly hit 15°F (-9°C)—and well below!But winter is when you can travel Lake Baikal’s ice on a horse-drawn sleigh, hooves sure-footed and mouths steaming like trains, and best enjoy the mineral hot springs that dot parts of the lakeshore. Or you could take a hovercraft over the ice or drive out in an ice truck, with the heater on high.Dinner comes out of holes drilled deep through the ice—often as clear as a magnifying glass—as fishermen pull up some of the lake’s grayling or omul, a kind of salmon.And this is Russia, so the vodka flows easily, a useful medicine against the cold.Dark comes early to the winter lake—reason enough to wear those ten layers of clothes. Or do as the locals do—have a couple more drinks and a long stay in a traditional banya steam house.Lake Baikal is on the western edge of the Republic of Buryatia in Siberia, and for the local Buryats, the New Year celebration, Sagaalgan, is reason enough to be on the lake in the dead of winter.Held in February, it’s the perfect time to visit relatives and consume curds, cream, sheep cheese, the alcoholic kurunga—white foods to mirror the white land.Then it’s time to throw old clothes into a bonfire at Ivolginsky Datsan, the sacred Buddhist temple located here; the flames burn away sins.

"Visitors to Parliament House, in Canberra, wear face masks as smoke from bushfires blankets the Australian capital on January 5, 2020.The dawn of the new decade has been dominated by images of Australia in flames. The devastating bushfires (wildfires) have already claimed 23 lives and destroyed nearly 2,000 homes. Half a billion animals are believed to have perished—including an estimated 30 percent of koalas in New South Wales (NSW)—as the fires have scorched an area larger than the 2019 Amazon and California fires combined.Approximately 150 fires are still burning across Victoria and NSW, the country’s most populated areas, with authorities predicting that it could take months to bring the crisis under control. So should travelers stay away? Here’s everything you need to know.The good news for travelers, according to a statement released by Tourism Australia on January 3, is that many areas of Australia are unaffected, and most tourism businesses are still open. Travelers can monitor conditions via the official fire service websites and Twitter feeds for each state and territory. Updated frequently, these resources identify where fires are currently burning, and what level of action people should take in those areas.Developed by the NSW Rural Fire Service, the Fires Near Me app (available for iOS and Android) tracks fires around the country, and identifies areas that have been burned this season. These areas aren’t necessarily off-limits, but tourists are urged to seek the most up-to-date information prior to departure, and remain informed about changing conditions while on the ground.Fires have not ravaged major cities, but smoke has caused the air quality to decline in Canberra, Melbourne, and Sydney in particular. Concerned travelers can monitor real-time updates on global website Aqicn.org. And with P2 and N95 respirator masks in high demand, consider bringing your own.Related: Why are Australia’s flying foxes perishing in the heat?With NSW and Victoria currently in states of emergency, would-be visitors may be wise to hold off on booking a trip to at-risk and affected regions until local authorities give the all-clear. But don’t be too quick to strike Australia off your bucket list. With operators predicting the bushfire season to cost the tourism industry hundreds of millions of dollars, arguably the best thing travelers can do to help it recover is visit.The NSW south coast and the East Gippsland area of northeast Victoria, both popular for their beach towns and wineries, have been the worst hit. Drinking water in several towns has been affected; check local council websites for more information.Around a third of South Australia’s Kangaroo Island has been decimated by fires. On the island’s west coast, leading Australian eco-hotel Southern Ocean Lodge didn’t survive the inferno.All national parks including campgrounds on the NSW south coast and Kosciuszko National Park (which lost Selwyn Snow Resort to fires) are closed until further notice. Several parks and campgrounds in Greater Sydney are also closed including Blue Mountains National Park, with Blue Mountains train lines expected to be down for months. Parks Victoria has also closed nine national parks.Blazes in other states including Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania are reportedly under control, with no major tourism destinations—such as Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef and Tasmania’s classic hiking trails—off-limits. Even in NSW and Victoria, it’s business as usual in many areas, such as the northern NSW surf town of Byron Bay and Victoria’s Great Ocean Road.Related: What do the wildfires mean for Australia’s drinking water?While most climate scientists are reluctant to attribute climate change impacts to a specific weather event, all agree climate change exacerbates the conditions in which bushfires occur. A combination of a record-breaking drought; Australia’s hottest year on record; dry, windy weather; and plenty of fuel on the ground created the perfect conditions for Australia’s summer of hell.In the wake of the crisis, Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has received international criticism for downplaying the role of global warming, opposing measures to combat climate change (Australia is one of the world’s highest per-capita carbon emitters), and rejecting additional funding for firefighters.Related: Why are the Australian wildfires causing firestorms?Dozens of disaster appeals have been launched to support firefighters as well as people and wildlife affected by Australia’s bushfire crisis. Initially designed to support the NSW Rural Fire Service, Australian celebrity comedian Celeste Barber’s Facebook fundraiser has been so successful (raising $28 million U.S. dollars and counting) that the funds will now be distributed to fire services in all states. You can also donate directly to state fire services.To help people affected, the Australian Red Cross has called for donations to assist in providing thousands of Australians with emergency assistance. The Victorian Government has also partnered with Bendigo Bank and the Salvation Army to establish the Victorian Bushfire Appeal, with a hundred percent of donated funds going directly to communities in need. Multiple fundraisers have also been launched via GoFundMe.In addition, the NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service (WIRES), World Wildlife Fund Australia, and the RSPCA have all launched appeals to help care for fire-affected wildlife. Donations the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital collects are being shared with other wildlife organizations.",
"Dozens of panting, suffocating gray-headed flying foxes clump together in an attempt to survive 110-degree heat in Yarra Bend Park, outside of Melbourne, in late December. Some 4,500 foxes, including many of these seen here, died over three days in the park.The 30,000 gray-headed flying foxes in Yarra Bend Park, just outside the heart of Melbourne, Australia, were having a fairly normal early spring.In September and October—springtime in Australia and prime birthing season for the 11-inch long megabats—many of the flying foxes had returned to the park from their winter migration up the coast. Females were birthing pups as normal, says biologist Stephen Brend, who is in charge of monitoring gray-headed flying foxes in Victoria province, including at Yarra Bend Park, which is home to a significant colony of the bats. All was routine.Bat rescuer Tamsyn Hogarth cradles a young rescued gray-headed flying fox in Yarra Bend Park. Hogarth runs Fly By Night, a flying fox rescue and rehabilitation clinic. She and other volunteers rescued 255 baby flying foxes from the park in December.“And then the horror started,” Brend says. “It got too hot, too quickly.”Incapable of surviving the extreme, relentless heat that gripped Melbourne in December, the flying foxes were dying. Across three days just before Christmas, when temperatues exceeded 110 degrees Fahrenehit, 4,500 of the park’s gray-headed flying foxes perished—15 percent of the colony’s population.Firefighters from Melbourne's Metropolitan Fire Brigade spray water on the bats clumping on tree trunks in Yarra Bend Park in an attempt to cool them down in late December.The tragedy for flying foxes in the park echoes scenes of wildlife suffering across the country and puts a spotlight on the perils of extreme heat, which for some species can be just as deadly as fire. Great and small, fast and slow, Australia’s endemic animals are falling victim to the heatwaves and fires that are ravaging the country at an unprecedented scale. It’s the hottest and driest summer in Australia in recorded history. As the planet warms, large-scale fires are becoming more frequent, and bushfire seasons are getting longer.For gray-headed flying foxes, which are classified as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Yarra Bend event is not isolated. “The colony in Adelaide suffered even worse,” says Brend. Several thousand flying fox babies died there from extreme heat between November and January, says Justin Welbergen, associate professor of animal ecology at Western Sydney University and president of the Australasian Bat Society. On January 4, many thousands of flying fox babies died across multiple roosts in and around the Sydney region in New South Wales, where the temperature reached a record-breaking 121 degrees Fahrenheit. Welbergen’s team, which monitors flying fox heat stress conditions, is calculating a final death toll.Kate Chamberlain, a wildlife rescuer, gives fluids to a dehydrated gray-headed flying fox in Yarra Bend Park.This summer’s extreme heat and extreme fires, which have imperiled Australia’s entire eastern coast—prime flying-fox habitat—“risk wiping out the 2019 generation” of newborn bats, Brend says. Some 80 percent of flying fox pups are born in October. They were young and vulnerable when heat waves and wildfires broke out late last year.A day in the life of a flying fox in a heatwave is unforgiving. By 5:30 a.m., as dawn breaks, the bats have returned to their trees after spending the night feeding on nectar and fruit. By 8 a.m., Brend says, it’s getting hot in their roosts. The bats fan their wings to keep cool, but they can only do it for so long before they start to get tired, he says. By noon, they’re getting exhausted, and temperatures continue to climb. The bats start to pant, which accelerates dehydration.At that point, they could fly into the river to get a drink (the Yarra River runs through the middle of the 640-acre park), “but it’s like us running to the shop in the middle of a heat wave,” Brend says. Flying takes energy, and when they’re exhausted and dehydrated, they’ll simply stay put.Distressed and starting to panic, the bats try to find a cool spot. Mothers will deposit their babies on branches and separate, Brend says, searching for a tree trunk that might be cooler. The bats follow each other—spotting one on a trunk seems to signal to the rest that it’s a refuge. They start to clump together. “It’s like a football scrum of bats,” Brend says. “To the observer, it looks mindless.” The ones who got there first are now surrounded and smothered by dozens of others.Yarra Bend Park ranger Stephen Brend passes a wheelbarrow filled with dead flying foxes that he and volunteers collected from the ground. Brend, Victoria province's grey-headed flying fox project officer, describes the three-day death event in the park as "carnage."“At that point in time everything has gone wrong,” Brend says. That’s when his team, made up of park staff and volunteers, will step in to try to break up the clumps by spraying them with water, which cools them down and slakes their thirst.On December 20th, at the height of the three-day heat event that killed 4,500 flying foxes, “it never got cool,” Brend says. At 9 p.m., the team was out spraying. But it was pitch black, tree limbs were falling, and there are venomous snakes in the brush. “We had to call it off. We couldn’t see. It was 38 degrees [100 degrees Fahrenheit]. It was deeply distressing,” he says. “It was carnage.”“One falls, and the rest cascade on the ground, crushing and suffocating each other. Dozens if not hundreds of dead or dying bats are at the bottom of the tree,” says Melbourne-based photojournalist Douglas Gimesy, who documented the December rescue efforts. “You’re looking down at them and they’re looking up at you gasping. They’re smothering and heating up. Volunteers will go in and separate out bodies and find some that are still alive. But you’ve got 20 to 30 rescuers and 4,500 bats. It’s like a war zone. It’s sad and distressing and heartbreaking, and you know it will happen again and again and again.”Wildlife rescuers Kate Chamberlain and Treycee Baker examine the body of a dead gray-headed flying fox they recovered from Yarra Bend Park in early January. The bat's wings were ripped from trauma.“Some we get to in time,” says Tamsyn Hogarth, one of the rescuers. “Others die in your hand.” By the third day, on December 20th, the air was thick with “the smell of death,” she says. Hogarth runs Fly By Night, a wildlife shelter in Melbourne dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and releasing gray-headed flying foxes. She and other volunteers rescued 255 babies during the extreme heat events in December in Yarra Bend Park. Two dozen volunteers across Victoria province are currently caring for the bats, which range in age from two to 12 weeks old.Hot days causing bat deaths are normal in Yarra Bend Park. “We’re always worried about heat events. You’re not going to get through summer without having really hot days,” says Brend. Last summer, for example, a few hundred bats died, he says. One study found that between 1994 and 2007, approximately 30,000 gray-headed flying foxes died in extreme heat events in Australia.But the timing of this year’s extreme heat—right after birthing season—contributed to unusually high mortality. Because the young were still nursing, their mothers’ energy levels were depleted, and all of them—parents and new babies—are more vulnerable, Brend says. The first weekend in December was extremely hot, and it was followed by a succession of hot days all month, culminating in the three-day death event, reaching a peak of 110 degrees Fahrenheit in Yarra Bend on December 20.A mother gray-headed flying fox hangs from a branch in Yarra Bend Park as her baby clings to her chest. About 80 percent of flying fox pups are born in October. The timing of the extreme heat in December meant that a whole generation of newborn bats, still dependent on their mothers, were hit hard.This close-up photo shows the fragile, membranous wing of a gray-headed flying fox. The bats will flap their wings, which can span more than three feet wide, in an attempt to cool down. This repeated flapping can lead to exhaustion.“It’s emotional and frightening for the species. And this is happening across their entire range,” Brend says. While Yarra Bend Park hasn’t been hit by fires, much of the flying foxes' habitat lies directly in the fire zones along Australia’s east coast.A May 2019 national survey estimated that there are around 589,000 gray-headed flying foxes in Australia. Although their numbers are robust now, they face a host of threats, from routine extreme heat events to entanglement in urban infrastructure, such as nets and barbed wire, as well as harassment from residents who see them as pests.The bats are nomadic. Much of their range is currently in the fire zones. Many travel north in winter, roosting in forests along the coast, which they may find scorched. The “bushfires have destroyed essential foraging resources on unprecedented scales,” says Welbergen. “There is no refuge for them,” says Brend. “It’s not like it’s bad in Melbourne but will be OK in northern New South Wales—it’s not OK anywhere.”“That can’t go on for too many cycles before the population declines,” Brend says. “I don’t want to be alarmist or dramatic—there are still thousands of these bats—but there’s no reason to be confident anymore.”Gray-headed flying foxes hang in trees in Yarra Bend Park. About 30,000 of the bats lived in the colony here before December 2019. The bats are vital to their forest ecosystem: They carry seeds and pollinate trees, gardening the forest by night.“Our worry is we’ll have the new passenger pigeon,” he says, referring to what was once the most abundant bird in North America before being hunted to extinction in the 19th century.Flying foxes play a vital role in the forest. “Their ecological role is as big, nocturnal bees,” Brend says. They carry seeds and pollinate trees, gardening the forest by night. “Bats need the forest and the forest needs the bats,” says Brend.And it’s still the middle of summer in Australia. “We’ll battle on for our upside down friends,” says Lawrence Pope, a rescuer caring for five orphaned baby bats at home, “but things look very grim.”“In this horror year, all species are suffering. It’s really frightening,” Brend says. “We’re hot, and they’re hot, and it’s a nightmare.”",
"On December 30, 2019, wildfires raged under plumes of smoke in Bairnsdale, Australia. Thousands of tourists fled Australia's wildfire-ravaged eastern coast ahead of worsening conditions.They start from the smoky tendrils of wildfires trailing into the atmosphere. Forming first as small, white clumps of clouds, in as little as 30 minutes they can become imposing thunderstorms.“It’s hard to overstate how dark they become,” says Nicholas McCarthy, a wildfire scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, of the pyrocumulonimbus clouds that grow from intense wildfires.Called pyroCbs for short, or often just fire storms, the dangerous atmospheric phenomena can worsen fires by generating intense winds, transporting embers, and striking lightning in yet- untouched regions.During California’s infamous Carr fire in 2018, pyroCbs grew from three to seven miles across in just 15 minutes and spawned a fiery tornado. These fire storms have been seen in places plagued by deadly wildfires like Portugal, Texas, and Arizona.A NASA satellite image shows smoke and clouds trailing from Australia's massive fires.As the planet warms, large-scale fires are becoming more frequent, and wildfire seasons are getting longer. Australia, which this year experienced its driest spring and hottest year, has experienced increasingly dangerous wildfires. Scientists say the fire storms there may increase as well, creating a dangerous positive feedback loop that scorches already-dry land.Exactly when and how fire storms spring to life can be difficult to predict, says Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta.“They are incredibly intense and erratic,” he notes.“Everything that goes into these phenomena are at their worst when these fires are occurring,” says Mike Fromm, an expert on pyroCbs at the U.S. Naval Research Lab.The same conditions that can lead to devastating wildfires—hot, dry air and intense wind—are also the most likely to produce fire-borne storms.As the air over a fire becomes intensely hot, it creates an upward-moving rush of wind called an updraft that funnels smoke into the atmosphere like a smokestack. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. The higher it lifts, the more likely it is to form a thunderstorm, says Flannigan.“These storms create their own wind field because they have such a violent updraft. It’s a very turbulent environment,” he says.Once formed, pyroCbs can look similar to intense thunderstorms, but they have key differences. They tend to produce lightning with positive, rather than negative charges, which lasts longer and allows the strikes of lightning more time to set the ground aflame. Fire storms also tend to stagnate, staying parked over the fires that create them. And perhaps most notably, fire storms rarely produce the precipitation desperately needed to squelch massive fires.“They produce almost no precipitation whatsoever,” says Fromm. “One of the ironies of the pyroCb is that because it’s generated by fire, the smoke seeding changes the microphysics to the point where precipitation doesn’t form.”Australia is particularly at risk of feeling the direct impacts of climate change. Since 2005, the country has experienced its 10 hottest years on record.Whether it be a single hurricane, flood, or fire, scientists can’t attribute any one single weather event to climate change, and instead look for trends showing how weather patterns have changed over time. Fromm says his research hasn’t definitely shown such a trend yet, but their research remains ongoing.Over the past year, Australia has had more fire-generated storms than it has in the past 20 years. As hot, dry conditions persist in the country, scientists expect pyroCbs to continue forming.“With climate change, we should see higher-intensity fires, and with higher-intensity fires, one would expect to see more of these storms,” says Flannigan. “I expect more in the future.”In a paper publish in July of last year, McCarthy and his study co-authors found that Australia’s changing climate could put more people and habitat at risk of seeing fire storms.What’s still unclear is the long-term effects of the storms. Scientists know they’re capable of spreading fires and worsening wildfire conditions, but Fromm says the pyroCbs may block out the sun in localized areas, creating a cooling effect.Australia is still in the beginning of its wildfire season, and meteorologists say the fires could continue for months.",
"The deadly Carr Fire burns through forests west of Redding, California, on July 30, 2018. The massive wildfire gave rise to a fire vortex as strong as an EF-3 tornado.This year, California has been no stranger to highly destructive wildfires. One such conflagration was this summer’s Carr Fire, which burned through nearly 230,000 acres, destroyed 1,079 homes, and killed at least seven people.The Carr Fire also engaged in some meteorological sorcery on July 26, as it conjured up an intense fire vortex: a blazing funnel with winds reaching 143 miles an hour and temperatures up to 2,700°F. The spinning blaze was about as intense as an EF-3 tornado, and it sent meteorologists scrambling to try and understand whether it was an oddly strong fire whirl—more akin to a dust devil—or a bona fide fire tornado.It’s possible that true fire tornadoes are exceptionally rare. To date, only one other potential occurrence, during the 2003 firestorm around Canberra in Australia, has been scientifically documented. Several other large fire-generated vortices have been observed that might have been fire tornadoes, but they weren’t systematically recorded and studied.The dangers posed by wildfires make these furious phenomena not just “hazardous to observe, but perhaps also sometimes inappropriate in the context of the more immediate concerns of protecting lives,” notes Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Nevada, Reno. With that in mind, some mysteries will likely linger.Now, though, Lareau and his colleagues have used cutting-edge satellite and radar data to reveal how the California fire vortex became a tornado-strength beast, offering critical new clues to our understanding of these potentially deadly events.Per the American Meteorological Society, a tornado is a rotating column of air hanging off a cumuliform cloud, which is the flat-bottomed, puffy variety often associated with thunderstorms. Tornadoes are tall structures that spin violently, and they are usually measured on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, which ranges from zero to five according to wind strength estimates based on the damage caused.By contrast, fire whirls commonly appear during wildfires, and they are not technically tornadoes. These ephemeral events last only a few minutes, spin weakly, and reach no more than 150 feet tall. They form when an updraft caused by the flames twists and vertically stretches the wind rushing inward.A fire whirl rises from the Sherpa Fire near Santa Barbara, California, in the early morning hours of June 18, 2016.Fire vortices are larger and more intense than fire whirls. So where does the notably intense July 26 vortex fit in this family of spinning spectacles? That depends on how it formed, and serendipitously, the vortex that day was caught by several fixed radar stations.The data confirm that a pyrocumulonimbus cloud was present above the fire vortex that day. These billowing, thunderstorm-capable clouds are generated by a wildfire’s intense, thermally driven updraft. During the Carr Fire, the pyrocumulonimbus cloud that formed stretched in size from 3.7 to 7.5 miles in just 15 minutes.As it did so, the fire vortex went from its infancy to a monstrosity, with its winds rapidly intensifying as it reached more than 3.2 miles into the air. This dangerous dance meant that what was happening was more tornado-like than a regular fire vortex.However, as the team reports in a November issue of Geophysical Research Letters, the data don’t show the fire vortex physically connecting with the cloud’s underbelly, so it’s still unclear whether it was a true fire tornado, or “pyrotornado.”The fire vortex wouldn’t have become the colossus it was without that cloud, says study coauthor Nick Nauslar, a fire weather forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center. One lingering question is why pyrocumulonimbus clouds regularly form over wildfires but only rarely trigger fire tornadoes.The Carr Fire event also behaved very differently from its cousin in Canberra. For one thing, it had a short damage path of around 3,300 feet, compared to the Canberra event’s damage track that was 12.4 miles long.Also, unlike its Australian relative, the Carr Fire vortex seemed to be highly dependent on the wildfire’s fury, while the Canberra version broke free a few times, repeatedly lifting up from the ground.The study is a nice analysis that links pyrocumulonimbus formation and vortex intensification, says Craig Clements, the director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, who wasn’t involved in the study. “However,” he adds, “it does not advance our understanding on what caused the vorticity to form in the first place.”That means we can’t yet forecast these events, but if more meteorological observations with cutting-edge technology are made on the fire line, we might be able to detect concerning circulations in advance. Even with just a few minutes of warning, Clements says, this could “really help save lives.”Unfortunately for us, opportunities to gather more data on fire vortices may be easier to come by than we would like. Wildfires are unquestionably exacerbated by our continued predilection for fossil fuels, and according to Lareau, the drier conditions brought on by the shifting climate may contribute to the development of both tornado-strength vortices as well as genuine fire tornadoes.In essence, he says, “longer fire seasons equate to more opportunities for extreme outcomes.”",
"When the speeding BMW emerged out of the smoke of burning eucalyptus trees, heading straight for her firetruck, Filipa Rodrigues had no time to react. “I had time only to think, ‘We’re going to crash,’” she says, massaging the burn marks on her arms, and then the car plowed into them, and the five volunteer firefighters stumbled out from their ruined truck into an inferno.It was high summer in 2017, and they had just crossed into the outer bands of the worst firestorm to ever hit Portugal, a presage for a new age of mega-fire that would soon stalk across landscapes from Spain to Australia. Rodrigues, then 24, stepped outside and her safety goggles immediately melted to her face; as she ripped them off, skin came with them. She blinked through the smoke at eucalyptus trees flying by, burning, in the winds of the biggest flames she had ever seen.Rodrigues was not a professional—like three generations of her male relatives, she was a member of the bombeiros, the volunteer firefighting corps that since the 1950s has served as first line of fire defense for the towns of the rugged, hardscrabble, limestone hills of the Portuguese interior. Every summer all types—doctors, teachers, mail carriers, college students—take their vacations at the local fire station, where they wait round the clock for word of fire.It was far from Rodrigues’s first wildfire. But she had never seen any like it: As the flames bore down on them faster than they could run, with their truck on fire and their radios melted, she immediately understood that she was going to die. The bombeiros tried to pull the BMW’s passengers out of the car—“We were screaming, screaming, but they didn’t respond”—but the heat forced them back, and they watched the flame take the BMW and its occupants. The twisting column of flame coming for her seemed unstoppable.“It seemed,” she says, “like the fire would take the entire world.”In a sense she was right. The new kind of mega-fire that broke out in the highlands of central Portugal on June 17, 2017, was the perfect firestorm brewed when an increasingly unstable atmosphere meets a landscape poised to burn. It’s also a warning of what the future holds for Mediterranean-style ecosystems from Turkey and Spain to Greece and California as climate change drives increasingly longer dry periods.“Portugal is the canary in the mine,” says Tiago Oliveira. Today he is director of AGIF, the Portuguese national fire control agency, but back in 2017 he was a corporate fire scientist, managing fire control for Navigator, the $1.5-billion Portuguese pulp company that grows eucalyptus in enormous plantation tracts for pulp and paper.After nearly being killed in a plantation fire in 1998—two comrades had broken and run before the fire, which caught them—Oliveira had turned himself to the question of why Portugal’s fires seemed to be getting worse. That question would drive him on to a doctorate and a series of papers on fire science with researchers at universities like MIT.His conclusion: Portugal, like the wider Mediterranean, was suffering from the confluence of two long-term trends: a sweeping abandonment of a rural landscape that had become economically irrelevant, coupled with a widespread governmental unwillingness to live with fire.“And if your aim is to exclude fire from this ecosystem,” he says, “you are doomed to fail.”It is a truism of the relationship between civilization and forests that where one rises, the other will fall back. From the Bronze Age up until the 1950s, Oliveira notes, civilization and industry rested on the resources provided by forests.“Peasants used pine straw to mix with manure for compost; firewood for the hearth; forest pastures for livestock; resins and wax for home industry,” he says.The Phoenecian traders and artisans who sailed up the Ebro River at the end of the Bronze Age found stands of primeval hardwoods perfect for making the charcoal needed to forge high-quality swords, as well as the axes that fed the forges. Their Carthaginian descendants lopped off Roman spear-points with razor sharp falcata, swords made with charcoal from upland oaks. The Romans who laboriously defeated them cleared the remaining Iberian forests for new industry: vineyards, goats, and sheep—wine, dairy, wool—and for the scaffolding and smelters of their gigantic silver mines worked by the enslaved.“By (Roman) antiquity,” says Pedro Bingre do Amaral, a professor of land use at the University of Coimbra, “the Portuguese landscape was almost treeless,” cut back by a series of advancing civilizations.By the 1300s, the uplands had become so deforested that the kings began to plant pine trees to control erosion. When the Portuguese burst outward in the early modern area, every single wooden ship sailing back and forth between Lisbon and the Estado da India or Captaincy of Bahia, carrying the wealth, slaves, and soldiers of the Portuguese Empire, required 2,000 oaks and an equivalent number of pines.Then, starting in the early 20th century with a spike that began in the 1950s, the pattern flipped. At the turn of the century Portugal had 2 percent tree cover; by the late 20th century it had shot up to nearly a third. The reason, Oliveira says, was this: In the 1950s, synthetic materials made from petroleum replaced plant and animal fiber, and chemical solvents and fertilizers made from petroleum and inorganic chemicals replaced forest products like pitch, peat, or pine needles, Factory farming replaced meat from hunting or domestic animals— cows, sheep, pigs goats—pastured in the forest. As rural people withdrew from the land that once filled their basic needs, the trees returned, and with them came fire.For bombeira Filipa Rodrigues, that pattern, which geographers call the “forest transition”—the return of forests to abandoned cropland – could be laid out in one statistic: When her father volunteered at the station in the 1980s, “we could count on 20 professionals.” Now they had seven. For more than a century, the highlands had been emptying out. Sons, sisters, cousins made their way down the mountain to Lisbon and onward to Canada, South Africa, or Brazil.“We have a problem in the highlands, and that problem is people,” says volunteer firefighter Hugo Carvalho, who worked as a mail carrier in the nearby town of Proença-a-Nova, watching as the elderly died or moved and the lights went dark.Trees came up in abandoned yards and fields, crowding against the tall grass and fire-loving shrubs that dried into fuel in the summer heat. They came down the new greenways of vacant houses, pointed like daggers into the hearts of towns, their seeds spreading on the fierce winds that blew in from the Atlantic.Yet unlike the primeval forests that Phoenecian sailors found 3,000 years ago, these new forests were feral, the half-wild, escaped offspring of the tracts of Atlantic pine and imported Australian acacia and eucalyptus.Which is to say: three fast-growing tree species, packed with essential oils, each of which had evolved to spread with wildfire.As increasingly serious fires burned through larger and larger swaths of the interior, the Portuguese government, Oliveira says, “got stuck in a firefighting trap.” Faced with a public outcry to do something, the Portuguese legislature passed new laws, bought new hardware, and moved quickly to “kill” the small blazes that could become large ones.Meanwhile the core problems—the abandoned countryside, the seasonal, volunteer firefighters, and the land base filling up with fire-loving trees—continued to fester, and by the summer of 2017, after more than a decade of aggressive termination of small fires by the bombeiros, the interior was stocked with fuel, waiting for a spark.On June 17, 2017, it came. A series of fires ignited in the valleys around the town of Pedrógão Grande, fueled by winds that blew down off a strange and unseasonal thunderstorm like a bellows, fanning the flames into three separate, enormous flame fronts.That June afternoon, Rodrigues and the rest of her crew of bombeiros had just killed a small blaze with their high-pressure hoses. As they headed up the mountain toward Pedrógão Grande, Rodrigues realized that night was falling early: There was so much soot in the air that the sky had gone dark.They did not know it yet, but they were driving into the teeth of something few in Europe had ever seen before. One of the few who had was fire scientist Marc Castellnou, in Catalunya, an autonomous region in neighboring Spain. As the chief fire scientist for Catalunya’s force of 5,000 professional firefighters, Castellnou had, like Portuguese fire chief Oliveira, become disturbed by the appearance of fires of unprecedented fury and destructive power.A fire’s power, he explains as we drive through the sun-baked pines near his hometown of Tivissa, toward where a fire ripped through the previous month, comes down to fuel and its ability to supply itself with oxygen, both of which had been steadily growing along with the increasingly unruly forests. In teaching his firefighters, Castellnou had used the metaphor of “five generations” of wildland fire from the first, when trees began to cover whole Iberian landscapes in the early 1900s, leading to fires of unprecedented size; to the fourth, when the inrush of trees and outgrowth of suburbs conspired to place ever more people in the “wildland urban interface,” complicating any firefighting plans that had previously relied on allowing land to be triaged; to the fifth, in which simultaneous big fires strained the resources of firefighting crews.By the fifth generation, Castellnou says, “we began to lose” to fires that outflanked and outmatched them. Then in January 2017, the European Commission sent him to Chile, where Castellnou saw something categorically worse than he had ever seen before: the overture to the new age of megafire. A forest fire is the product of a powerful, nonlinear chemical reaction, the release of energy trapped in the carbon bonds of trees. Its ability to spread is directly, even exponentially, proportional to the fuel available to it, and to how energized and reactive the atmosphere is.Sufficiently powerful fires have always been able to create their own weather. Iberian firefighters I spoke to describe facing fire tornadoes, or the dreaded mushroom of the pyrocumulus, in which a plume of hot air rises into the atmosphere and collapses back down, feeding the fire that started it.What came in Chile, Castellnou says, was far worse: a pyrocumulonimbus cloud, a fire system that reached the border of space.“We have never seen something of this size, never in Chile's history,” President Michele Bachelet said, visiting the ashes of a territory about the size of Delaware that within two days had been reduced to a moonscape—killing 11 people and creating thousands of refugees. In the town of Santa Olga alone, a thousand houses burned.The new instability in the atmosphere and the unprecedented fuel stocks of the unmanaged forests had come together, Castellnou says. Later, fire scientists like Craig Clements, of San Jose State University, would hypothesize that the plume had become so big that it reached the troposphere; on the ground, theory gave way to practicality.“We could not fight them,” Castellnou said. “You just had to get away, and try to change the conditions on the ground to starve the fire.”On his return to Europe, he told the Commission that they would likely be seeing these pyrocumulonimbus fires—which he called “sixth-generation megafires”—in Europe within five years. “Today’s conditions in the Mediterranean,” he told them, “are tomorrow’s in Central Europe.”But he had underestimated how quickly things were changing. Barely five months later, he watched on a live feed from the Pedrógão Grande fire station as the flames rose above the forest that Filipa Rodrigues’s crew was driving into.It was, he would say later, a repeat of Chile, a replay of the “nightmare scenario” that unfolds when cold Atlantic winds meet a hot Mediterranean summer. In the Portuguese highlands, the wildfires burned through the dense, abandoned forests below an atmosphere vibrating with sustained heat, as a column of unstable, superheated air streamed upward as through a chimney above the highlands. Hundreds of panicked weekenders and tourists, unaccustomed to the regular fires of the backcountry, fled down narrow, overgrown roads, heading for the safety of the coast.Many drove directly into a death trap. Usually night offers a respite from fire. In the Mediterranean, Proença-a-Nova fire chief Tiago Marques told me, firefighters besiege a fire by day and kill it by night, when falling temperatures and rising humidity undermine its power.Not now. This fire, as fire scientist Craig Clements would later conclude, had grown too hot. Instead of slowing the fire, the oncoming dew boiled off the flame front like water off the rocks of a sauna, sending a pulse of superheated steam almost to the borders of space. As it pillowed up against the frigid edge of the earth’s atmosphere, the steam condensed and fell as hail, pushing a mass of frigid air down on top of the wildfire.In any combustion reaction, more compression means more heat and power: The downrushing front made the difference between wildfire and blast furnace. On the video feed from Pedrógão Grande, Castellnou watched the collapsing downburst depress the fire column horizontally toward the trees, now clogged with cars. At around nightfall they caught, and within minutes 8 square kilometers of woodland, packed with fleeing vacationers, burst into flame.Lost in the dense smoke, cars swerved into trees, guardrails, and each other, creating deadly pileups and road blockages as the fire came on faster than anyone thought possible.It was that inferno that the terrified couple in the BMW had been fleeing—and that Rodrigues and her companions were now trapped in. They staggered toward the BMW, just a few meters away, but were forced back by a heat that scorched their skin through their fireproof clothes. They watched as the flames swallowed the car.The firefighters fell back to a crossroads, skin bubbling and lungs blistered, their truck and radios destroyed, the fire approaching at a fast jog. One would die from lungs blistered by superheated air; the others would have as well -- had fate not intervened in the form of a pickup truck that had been forced to turn back in the face of the flames.They were exceedingly lucky. The fate of those trapped inside the flames would spread trauma across the highlands and the wider Portuguese consciousness, particularly the stories and forensic evidence from the deadly roadblocks on National Highway 236, quickly dubbed The Highway of Death.“They died if they ran, and they died if they stayed in their cars,” says Nadia Araceli Piazza, a lawyer who lost her son and ex-husband to the fires.Their cause of death, like 65 others trapped and killed that June day—the bulk of them on roads like Highway 236—was “carbonization.” Many were found, she notes, wrapped around their loved ones, their muscles tightened in their last moments by the heat of the flame.These dynamics, Castellnou and Oliveira say, have been seen across the world in the past three years, as sixth-generation fires have shown up in Mediterranean climates everywhere—meaning ecosystems from the Americas to Australia—wherever cold ocean winds blow across sun-kissed, dry mountains bursting with fire-loving plants.In 2018, 83 died in Greek fires whipped up by a similar long downburst during a summer when forest fires burned, for the first time in history, in every European country. The following year, a pyrocumulonimbus like Portugal’s October 2017 fires collapsed in a long waterfall over flames spreading from an electrical leak in Southern California—where unchecked suburban development has crowded into the traditional fire lanes of the chaparral—killing 90 and nearly wiping the town of Paradise, California off the map.Castellnou and Tiago Oliveira, the Portuguese national fire chief, are part of a new wave of wildland firefighters who believe that the solution is a new way of living with fire.Both fire scientists believe that the best strategy lies in a full-time approach to fire defense—unlike the bombeiros’ seasonal approach—with firefighters building and maintaining fire lines throughout the year so they will be prepared to battle fires when they break out, as well as keeping development out of established fire lanes.But the fire problem will not be solved, Oliveira says, without the evolution of a new kind of rural landscape, where people value the forest once again and defend the land from fire, because they use it again, be it for pasturing sheep and goats, or beekeeping, tourism, or small-scale biomass energy generation.This is not as sexy as buying new helicopters, he admits ruefully, and lacks the rural romance of the bombeiros. “No one was ever called a hero,” Oliveira says ruefully, “for averting a crisis before it happened.”Still, he believes the model of so-called polycentric governance, poli-sci speak for giving local people the authority and resources to solve their fire problems locally, combined with a revitalized rural economy, are the only long-term way for the Portuguese interior, or other Mediterranean ecosystems like California, Chile, Greece, or Spain, to manage their overwhelming fire risk—a risk that is moving north into the unprepared lands of the rest of Europe.This is happening in a few settlements. In Proença-a-Nova, tech company Novatech has moved in from Lisbon, and dozens of young workers are now getting married and moving back onto country houses where they mow grass and tend orchards. In the nearby village of Ferraria de São João, hotelier Pedro Pedrosa led his neighbors in uprooting the eucalyptus that crowded their village, building terraces that they planted with native cork oaks, whose thick cambium serves as a fire retardant—to the north of town, Pedrosa says, a 200-year-old stand of oaks had broken the wave of fire before it could consume the town.“We need to step away from a top-down approach,” Portuguese fire chief Oliveira says. For too long, the people of the countryside had relied on centralized state authority, and on the beloved volunteer firefighters, to stop the wildfire problem. If it can use the fire danger to inspire a recolonization of its rural hinterlands, Oliveira says, “Portugal can be the case study for the rest of Europe.”But he knows a bomb is ticking in the background. The changes in Lisbon have not yet penetrated to most of the backcountry, where burnt-out pines still stick from denuded hills like worn-out toothbrushes, stubby, oil-packed eucalyptus already springing up beneath them. One surreal impact of the generations of neglect of the highlands by the central government is that Lisbon doesn’t know who owns the bulk of the land in the interior, which makes establishing land policy virtually impossible, though a federal survey is ongoing.And the rural population, says Filipa Rodrigues, the former bombeira, is weaker and more demoralized than it has ever been. Two years after the 2017 fires, the experience of the firestorm has left her mind and extremities scarred.“We had never failed before,” she says in her home in Castanheira do Pera. “Now I see fire,” she says, gesturing at her fireplace, “and I start to tremble. We live with the consequences of what happened—the people we lost—every day.”It becomes easy, she says, to abandon land that others are already abandoning. She does not want to leave, but with a limited local economy, a young daughter, and a great risk of fire, she is not sure how she can stay. Most of her friends live in Lisbon, their family lands growing over behind them. Every day she watches the eucalyptus grow, unchecked and illegal, bare meters from the house where they sleep.She does not know who owns the plot, or when the next spark will come.",
"The Parthenon, the ancient Acropolis temple in Athens, Greece, stands as smoke billows in the background amid a wildfire in Kineta, near Athens.In Greece, the fires came fast and hard, sweeping through towns so quickly that residents were trapped in clouds of smoke. Some people ran toward the ocean, plunging into the water to save themselves from the flames onshore. Others tried to shelter in buildings or cars. But the fires, which raged through several towns on the outskirts of Athens, have claimed 91 lives, making it the most deadly wildfire season in Europe since 1900.In Sweden, more than 80 fires across 100 square miles spread through the thick, normally damp northern forests. Finland and Latvia battle their own blazes.Europe sets on fire each summer, especially around the Mediterranean. On average, about 1500 square miles of the E.U. burn every year. But last year fires burned nearly three times that much, killing 66 people in Portugal and Spain and stretching the firefighting efforts and budgets thin across the continent. “In 2018, we are observing an expansion of the areas that are at risk, with fires occurring in countries where wildfires were not so common in the past,” says Jesús San-Miguel, a researcher at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre.These fires across the continent have something in common: they were more likely to happen, and to burn more destructively, because of human-caused climate change. While scientists can’t attribute any single fire solely to climate change, they can say that warming conditions on the Earth—and the ways that warming affects drives more extreme weather, faster-growing, more flammable plants, and more lightning storms—set the stage for more fires and more destructive ones in the future.Fire is both deeply simple and incredibly complex, with origins hundreds of millions of years ago. A fire requires only three things: something to burn; oxygen to fuel the combustion; and a spark to set it all off.For the first few billion years of Earth’s history, there was no fire. Bolts of lightning or molten volcanic particles (i.e. sparks) spewed into the air. But this early Earth atmosphere, dense with methane and ammonia (and later, carbon dioxide) and devoid of gaseous oxygen, squelched any proto-flames. And until a few hundred million years ago, there was nothing around to burn.But once early plants and other photosynthezisers evolved, they transformed the atmosphere, turning carbon dioxide into drafts of oxygen. As a result, by about 500 million years ago, the second ingredient for fire was prepared. The third ingredient came about 30 million years later when plants made it out of the ocean and began creeping over the surface of the land. Not long after, Earth saw its first fires.Fires have swept across Earth ever since. Despite their destruction, the planet’s ecosystems have evolved to tolerate it, or in some cases, they require fire to renew nutrients.But the frequency, intensity, and extent of those fires have changed dramatically. Those changes have been closely tied to climate shifts in the past. When the planet warms up—leading the dry parts of the planet to dry out further—fires happen more frequently and burn bigger.“When you see fire frequencies increasing in the past, there’s always evidence telling you there’s drier climate, “says Graciela Gil-Romera, a paleoecologist at Aberystwyth University in Wales who studies the history of fire. “That’s always related to enhanced fire activity.”Over the past 400 million years, oxygen concentrations have stayed high enough to fuel fires. So the other ingredients—the amount of burnable material and the number of ways to light it aflame—are the main controls on modern fire.And the sparks seem to be increasing. Not only are humans causing more fires, both intentionally and unintentionally, but lightning strikes are expected to increase as the climate warms. Warmer, more turbulent air leads to more thunderstorms, which in turn leads to more lightning. And a recent study found that lightning-induced fires were becoming more and more common across the northern reaches of the American continent, increasing on average by two to five percent each year since 1975.A wildfire rages near the town of Rafina, near Athens, Greece, on July 23, 2018. At least 20 people have died and more have been injured as wild fires tore through woodland and villages around Athens, while blazes caused widespread damage in Sweden and other northern European nations.But the biggest effect on how, where, and how intensely fires burn is the fuel load of burnable material. This has led Juli Pausas, an ecologist who focuses on fire at the Universitat de Valencia in Spain, to add a fourth ingredient to the fire recipe: a dry season.“The drought is key for predicting whether the fires will happen,” says Marco Turco, a climate scientist at the University of Barcelona who is working to develop a tool to predict where and when fires might break out in coming months. In his view, climate is the most important ingredient, because it influences the flammability, type, and availability of combustible material.The worst fire years tend to appear amid seasonal extremes, when a wet season that fuels exuberant plant growth is followed by an extremely dry season that sucks the water out of the plants and the soil.These conditions are exactly what caused the fires in northern Europe this year. A wet winter fattened plants across the continent, and then the heat set in. A historic heat wave—which scientists say was about twice as likely to occur because of human-caused climate change—settled in over the continent.Bill DeGroot, a scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, explains that the fire “season” has extended over the past few decades in many parts of the world, largely because warmer temperatures dry out plants more thoroughly and sooner in the year. In the western U.S., the length of time between the first and last fires of the year stretched by nearly 80 days since 1980. In Canada, where he works, the season is about a month longer.“A fire regime is something that's changing, shifting all the time,” says DeGroot. “But this change with climate change is going to make a very significant shift in a relatively short period of time. The forest is going to look different in the future than it looks now.”Climate change accelerates this process, as dry places tend to get drier. When the European Joint Research Centre analyzed models of present and future fire likelihood across Europe, it found that the parts of Europe that are already dry, like Spain, Greece, Turkey, will dry out further and be more susceptible to burning. Already, an average of over 3500 square miles—an area more than three times the size of Rhode Island-- burn each year across Europe. By the end of the century, that number could double.In the western U.S., climate change has warmed and dried out the plants that blanket mountains, valleys, and plains. That extra dryness, says Park Williams, a scientist who studies the relationship between climate change and fire at Columbia University, made about twice as much area of the western U.S. ripe for catching on fire than would have been expected without climate change.“Fire is changing right before our eyes,” Williams says.There’s one other way climate change is influencing the number and frequency of fires, and it has to do with the jet stream, the atmospheric highway high up in the sky that carries weather from west to east.The shape of the jet stream, and how fast weather travels along it, is controlled by the temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator. When the temperature difference is small, weather patterns move more slowly. But climate change is causing the Arctic to warm fast, making that temperature difference smaller. As a result, weather events in the northern hemisphere stay in place for longer. When it’s wet, it stays wet, feeding and plumping plant growth. And when it’s hot, it stays hot, sucking more and more moisture out of those same plants.The heat wave that settled in over Europe this summer is a good example of these dynamics in play, says the University of Arizona’s Valerie Trouet. “The fires in Sweden, I would say, are directly linked to the heat wave going on there and the concurrent drought,” she says.The jet stream moves north and south all the time—but its movements have recently become more extreme. Trouet and her colleagues looked a 300-year long record of the jet stream's position over Europe, and found that in the last three decades, since the planet started warming as a result of humans, the jet stream was more likely to sit near one of its extremes. Either it's very far south, letting icy arctic air sweep over Europe. Or, like now, it's very far north, letting hot southern air come far up into Northern Europe. And with more heatwaves and droughts, come more fires.",
"What a difference a leaf makes! Well, not one leaf. We have 3.1 trillion trees on our planet—that’s 422 trees per person. If we count all the leaves on all those trees and take a look at what they do collectively to the air around us, the effect—and I do not exaggerate—is stunning. I’ve got a video from NASA. When you see it, I think your jaw is going to drop—just a little.It tracks the flow of carbon dioxide across the planet over 12 months, starting in January. Most of the action takes place in the Northern Hemisphere because that’s where most of the land is, and so that’s where most of the trees are. The biggest temperate forests are in Canada, Siberia, and Scandinavia.Here’s the thing about trees …We know they absorb air. Their leaves gobble carbon dioxide, and then, with help from the sun, the carbon stays in the tree (as branches, trunks). Oxygen gets released.Come winter, the leaves fall off, trees go bare. Without leaves, trees go quiet. Any extra CO2 is more likely to hang in the atmosphere—until June.That’s the month when trillions upon trillions of leaves are opening, growing, and starting to breathe, and what you will see in the video is their collective breath literally cleaning the sky. This video begins in January, but keep watching till we hit June (then July, then August). It’s like the world’s northern forests become a giant vacuum cleaner, scouring the air, sucking down the CO2 till around November.When leaves fall, the situation reverses … and it feels a little scary. Take a look:Consider the fantastic scale of this global dance. It starts, as I said, with 3.1 trillion trees. That’s the latest census, published a few months ago in the science journal Nature (see page 201) by Yale’s Thomas Crowther, a Climate and Energy Institute postdoctoral fellow. If he’s right, there are more trees on Earth than there are stars in the Milky Way.Now imagine how many leaves might be on all those trees. It’s a very big number. The University of Washington tried to come up with a leaf count for a “mature oak,” but oaks are so variable that they could only give us a range: 200,000 to half a million leaves per tree.Next, look closely at any oak leaf or any leaf (or, for that matter, the surface of any green plant, even a blade of grass) with a magnifying glass. You’ll find little breathing tubes called stomata. That’s “mouth” in Greek, because, like mouths, they’re openings that allow outside air in.I think of them more like lungs, often with squeezable openings. That’s where the carbon dioxide gets in and the oxygen slips out. Photographer Robert Dash used a scanning electron microscope to magnify the surface of an actual oak leaf 150 times, and all those little cheerio-like openings you see here? We’re going to point a few out …… There are so, so many of them! On, say, a square millimeter of leaf—that’s one thousandth of a square inch—you might find a hundred to a thousand little lungs.So consider:If we multiply all those leafy lungs times all those leaves times all those trees and add grasses into the bargain, we’re talking about an unimaginably vast planetary breathing system—a giant green machine that pulls enormous quantities of carbon dioxide out of the air, especially in the warmer months.That’s what the NASA video shows us: We can see the Green Machine turning on, then, a few months later, turning off. When it’s on, when the leaves are out, those ugly, poisonous-looking swirls of orange and red vanish from the sky. The machine works. And this happens every year. It’s as though the Earth itself has lungs.But for all of its lung power, CO2 concentrations keep building in our atmosphere. We’re apparently pouring so much CO2 into the sky that the trees can’t keep up.Twelve thousand years ago, the Yale study says, there were twice as many trees on Earth. Apparently, we need their help. We need more trees.We really do.To see who’s pouring the most carbon dioxide into the sky, take a look at this graphic from George Washington University. It shows that China, the U.S., India, and Russia are the biggest offenders, but every nation is listed in descending order of, um, villainy, so you can see how your favorite nation is doing.Trees, meanwhile, aren’t the only CO2 removers on the planet. Oceans suck carbon dioxide as well. Animals eat carbon, die, and sink to the bottom of the sea. The White Cliffs of Dover are made from the skeletons of carbon-rich animals. Chalk is basically carbon storage.So yes, plants aren’t the only ones cleaning the air—but it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have more of them.",
"Growing up in California, photographer Stuart Palley has spent a lifetime both fascinated by and well-accustomed to wildfires—a captivation that he has kindled through his career.Based in Southern California, Palley has spent the past five years photographing wildland fires in the state, capturing a vast array of stunning images from Orange County to Yosemite. (Learn wildfire safety tips.)This year, with raging wildfires throughout California burning hundreds of thousands of acres, Palley has had no shortage of opportunities to continue his ongoing project. “I thought since we had a wet winter the fire activity would be mitigated,” Palley says, “but grasses and dead trees impacted by the bark beetle have caught fire.”Up-close photographic access to these fires can be hard to come by; only specially credentialed media are allowed in the fire zones. But Palley says that even this access can be insufficient: "The opportunity to hike around with the crew, though—that takes time and experience.”As it happens, Palley is uniquely suited to enter the blazes. Not only is he a photographer interested in fire, he is also a qualified base-level wildland firefighter. Because of this, the firefighters aren’t as worried about Palley's safety when he is right alongside them.Beyond expertise, photographing fires requires a steady resupply of equipment, as evidenced by Palley's melted lenses and broken camera parts. “Normal weather sealing is not preventive against fire damage,” he says.Despite his personal relationship with California wildfires, Palley prefers viewing these natural disasters from a distance, as emblems of humans' fraught relationship with the environment.“Fire is critical to the health and maintenance of the ecosystem," says Palley. "However, we’ve suppressed these fires so much there is now a massive fuel overgrowth.”  But even as the flames remind Palley of humans' toll on the environment, he remains painfully aware that wildfires pose their own devastating toll as well.“I see people who don’t know whether their house has burnt down, and they are in limbo," he says. "It’s hard to watch.”See more of Stuart Palley's work on his website and follow him on Instagram.",
"Orphaned and rescued gray-headed flying foxes feed on the pollen 
of native eucalyptus flowers that have been brought in as a treat. Their
 love of flowering plants is what makes them such important pollinators 
for native Australian forests.It’s best to keep your voice down when strolling through Melbourne’s Yarra Bend Golf Course. The sport requires peace and quiet—as do the 30,000 bats sleeping in the trees that dot the green.Such large groups of gray-headed flying foxes, a species of fruit-eating megabat that measures 11 inches tall, are no longer uncommon sights in several Australian cities, including Melbourne. Over the past few decades, the expansion of new urban food sources and development in the bats’ rural homes have made cities their main residence.A rescued gray-headed flying fox pup is looked after by wildlife caretaker Bev Brown. The bats are extremely intelligent, Brown says, and call out to their caretakers when they see them coming.This migration has been a mixed blessing for flying foxes, which face threats from urban infrastructure such as nets and barbed wire, as well as harassment from residents. But some local advocates, are fighting to help this threatened species.“We want the bats to be here forever, or however long they choose to be here,” says Stephen Brend, the state park officer in charge of monitoring the Yarra Bend roost. The population is doing well this year, and for that to continue in an increasingly urbanized Australia, both the flying residents and their human neighbors will have to adapt.Julie and Graeme, two wildlife caretakers, prepare a meal for several recently orphaned gray-headed flying fox pups. In the wild the young would be hanging on their mother, but under care, they direct their affection and clinginess toward humans.Hot summers—which could become more common due to global warming—can cause lethal heat stress among bats. This gray-headed flying fox was found exhausted and dehydrated on one such day, and it is hand-fed fruit in an incubator at a wildlife caretaker’s home.An orphaned baby gray-headed flying fox holds onto the finger of a caretaker. Orphans appear September through November, when they’ve lost their mothers before they were old enough to fend for themselves.Gray-headed flying foxes have a taste for a range of different pollens and nectars—a trait that makes them essential forest pollinators. But some of their favorite plant species have recently become popular ornamentals in yards and gardens in Australian cities. More and more bats are shifting their roosts from rural areas to cities. Justin Welbergen, an ecologist at Western Sydney University and the president of the Australasian Bat Society, thinks these urban smorgasbords are the main cause.For wildlife photographer and Melbourne resident Doug Gimesy, who is documenting how the species navigates the city, this migration of bats has essentially eliminated his commute. But most Australians don’t share Gimesy’s excitement. “Having 50,000 flying foxes in your backyard is difficult to deal with,” Welbergen says. They smell, they make noise, and they poop. Their public image is made worse by unfounded fears about the diseases they are thought to spread.After two months of care, a rescued and rehabilitated gray-headed flying fox, released just seconds earlier, takes to the skies to head back home to his colony.So almost no matter where the bats settle, local residents want them gone. For example, the Melbourne contingent of flying foxes originally chose to roost in the Royal Botanic Gardens in the 1980s. By the 2000s, public animosity towards the bats, combined with the damage they caused to the gardens, forced park employees to usher the bats into Yarra Bend Park instead, where the department could watch over them more closely, Brend says.Park employees can’t protect the bats when they fly off in search of food, however, which is when they really get into trouble. Residents often try to protect the fruit trees in their yards by surrounding them with barbed wire or nets, both of which can have lethal consequences for bats.A gray-headed flying fox hangs entangled in barbed wire that surrounds a factory in a Melbourne suburb. It was rescued by the photographer and his partner and was successfully released several months later. Since starting to photograph the bats, Gimesy has learned of their struggle and has become a rescue volunteer himself.Bev Brown has been nursing sick and injured gray-headed flying foxes back to health ever since someone dropped a baby bat off at her house 16 years ago. In 2018, she earned the Order of Australia Medal for her volunteer work. During that time, she’s seen all kinds of bat encounters.In the summer, she says, eight to 10 bats a day are brought in suffering net-related wounds. Entangled mothers will try and chew off their own wings to get back to their babies. And strings wound too tightly around blood vessels for too long can damage the tissue in a bat’s wing. Brown often tries to help these bats, but sometimes their wing tissue spontaneously declines, and the animal has to be put down. “The worst thing is, those big brown eyes look up at you, and you have to have it euthanized,” Brown says. “I still cry every time.”A gray-headed flying fox is caught under netting in a person’s yard in inner Melbourne. The nets are meant to keep the bats from eating the fruit on trees, but if the weave is too big—as is the case with this net—the bats can get trapped. Luckily, this bat was only caught under the mesh, not in it. He was successfully rescued and released into the wild 10 days later.Even with these challenges, the Melbourne bats are more fortunate than some. Yarra Bend is a sanctioned home. Elsewhere in Australia, residents can chase the bats from their roosts whenever they like—it’s even legal to shoot them in some areas, like orchards. Still, the bats continue to migrate into cities, attracted by the fruity feasts.Outside city limits, developers are clearing the plants the bats feed on, as rural areas are increasingly converted into farmland and housing developments, or cut down for wood pulp. Welbergen argues that if the destruction continues, there will be fewer and fewer food options for the population, which makes habitat destruction the species’ primary threat.Global warming puts additional pressure on the flying fox population. During extremely hot days, which are on the rise, the bats can die from heat stress, a condition they signal by clumping together and slowly sliding down tree trunks in a furry mass. If heat waves occur in the spring, while babies are still completely dependent on their mothers, Brend says that could kill almost an entire year’s worth of offspring.With so many factors working against the bats, its seems the only way to ensure they continue filling the night sky is to better understand their inner workings. More researchers are focusing on flying foxes than ever before, says Welbergen, and their collective results should help craft more evidence-based rescue efforts.A mother gray-headed flying fox in full flight and can reach speeds of up to 25 miles per hour, even while her pup breastfeeds.In the meantime, the bats have taught Gimesy, who often travels around the world for work, the value of staying local. As a photographer, he says, “I think we should focus on issues closer to home, because those can have the most impact.”Brend and Brown, too, will continue caring for the bats and educating the public to help them accept their nocturnal neighbors. One local department store, for example, has agreed to only sell small-weave tree netting that bats can’t get caught in. And Brown visits homes surrounding new roosts to answer residents’ questions and ease their concerns.“People think they’re flying vermin, but I’ve raised my children with these flying mammals,” Brown says. Brend feels similarly. “People have such negative opinions about bats, and we’re trying to overcome that,” he says.Gray-headed flying foxes fly  over Melbourne during a warm summer’s sunset looking for food. The nightly exodus can include up to 50,000 bats. At daybreak, the flying foxes return to the trees of Yarra Bend Park, where the park's department monitors the population and makes sure the bats are healthy. In Australian cities that don’t provide the bats with a guaranteed home, residents often force them to resettling elsewhere.",
"For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened vegetation produced by raging bushfires have collected along the shorelines of New South Wales in Australia, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide.Sydney, New South WalesIn the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus. (Australia's flying foxes are already dying en mass due to the extreme heat.)“Disturbance on this scale is almost certainly going to impact biodiversity. I’m remarkably worried about the effects on freshwater ecosystems,” says Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra.“Given the severity of the fires, pretty much everything [in burned landscapes] is gone, so one of the big issues is that when we do get some rain, a lot of that ash and crap, nothing is going to stop it running in our catchments,” adds Ricky Spencer, a conservationist and ecologist at the University of Western Sydney in New South Wales (NSW).One of the biggest worries is that the sudden influx of nutrients into waterways may lead to “blackwater events” caused by blooms of blue-green algae, also called cyanobacteria. Oxygen can subsequently drop to dangerously low levels for other aquatic life, potentially leading to mass fish kills and affecting species such as freshwater turtles.Blooms caused by agricultural run-off and the ongoing drought led to the death of millions of fish—mostly golden perch and Murray cod, which are important recreational Australian fish species—in the rivers of western NSW last summer. Algal blooms were likely this year anyway in drought-afflicted waterways, but Spencer fears they will be exacerbated by the bushfires.“These [blooms] could be ongoing until we start to see some growth along the river systems, or have a really good flush of rain,” he says.Some research has also shown that fire mobilizes mercury in runoff, adds Katherine Dafforn, an environmental scientist at both Macquarie University in Sydney and the Sydney Institute of Marine Science.“Higher concentrations of mercury have been found in fish from lakes in burned catchments compared to reference catchments,” she says, with potential impacts for human health if fish at the top of the food chain are eaten.This mass fish kill at Darling River in New South Wales was linked to drought and is one of the largest for this region in living memory.Algal blooms in dams could lead to significant problems for the water supply of major cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne. Warragamba Dam, to the west of Sydney, provides drinking water for 3.7 million people. But vast bushfires in and around its catchment area have so far burned more than 148,000 acres of forest.Forests have burned across “80 to 90 percent of the significant parts of the catchment,” says Stuart Khan, an engineer at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney who studies contaminants in water treatment processes.A bushfire in the catchment in 2006 was the likely cause of an algal bloom that lasted several months in the dam in 2007, and the current bushfires are far more extensive.Algal blooms in the drinking supply are problematic for several reasons. The resultant deoxygenation can cause fish kills, but it also makes iron and manganese soluble, which can give water a poor taste, odor, and color. Cyanobacteria can also produce chemicals that give water a musty or earthy flavor.In rare cases, blooms produce dangerous cyanotoxins, which “will require a lot of attention to find out and be looking closely at what’s growing in these reservoirs,” adds Khan. While he thinks public health problems are unlikely in Sydney, he does worry about the challenge of keeping treatment plants running.“We are not accustomed to having massive amounts of cyanobacteria and ash coming through our plants … and the treatment processes might be slowed down significantly,” he says.With the current drought, Sydney’s water supplies are already overstretched, necessitating the use of a desalination plant. If the rate of production of treated water from Warragamba slows, it might lead to temporary but significant shortages and severe drought restrictions. Forested areas that make up water catchments have been incinerated throughout southeast Australia, and the fire crisis is likely to continue for several months, so it’s possible the drinking supply of many urban centers across the southeast could be affected by the end of the summer.The bushfires will likely have further serious effects on Australia’s river systems, which could exacerbate the dangers to the duck-billed platypus. Loss of shady vegetation around the small streams and pools it inhabits may raise water temperatures to levels it finds intolerable—typically anything above 83 degrees Fahrenheit.“Platypus are weird little creatures, in that they don’t have any way of getting rid of heat. Their only response to warm water is to just sit in their burrow and hope it goes away,” says Thompson. During the terrible Millennium Drought 20 years ago, many platypuses simply retreated into their burrows and died there, he adds. (Find out more about the silent decline of the platypus.)This year’s drought is even worse, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology last week reporting 2019 was the both the driest and hottest year in 120 years of record taking. It’s possible the platypus could become locally extinct in parts of the north and west of its eastern Australian range, something that Thompson’s research suggested was already on the cards with climate change.“It’s becoming a death by a thousand cuts,” he says. “The Millennium Drought knocked back a lot of our freshwater biota. They’ve never quite recovered in many cases, and now we have these big landscape-scale fires… . It’s a real concern, and we could certainly lose species.”Eventually the ash, soot, and sediment that runs into the rivers will wash out to sea, but the effects of bushfires on marine life have been little studied and are much less certain.“The scale of these fires are unprecedented, and the images we are seeing of ash- and soot-laden waves along our beaches indicate that there is a very high density in the water column, so that is likely to have localized effects in those areas,” says Emma Johnston, a marine ecologist at UNSW.Detritus doesn’t necessarily have to be toxic to cause problems, as tiny particles can clog the gills of fish and the foraging apparatus of filter feeders such as mussels, sponges, and corals.While few studies have looked at the impact of charcoal and ash on marine organisms and possible toxins generated by bushfires, it’s certainly possible they could be detrimental, adds Johnston, and the influx of nutrients into the ocean may also cause algal blooms there.Thankfully, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has not yet been affected, as the focus of the fires have so far been further south, and the ocean currents carries water in a southerly direction, away from the reef.While very little is yet known about the effects of soot and ash on marine life, there could be an array of impacts if the levels of exposure are high enough, says Andrew Negri at the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville, Queensland, who has studied the negative effects of coal dust from mining on the Great Barrier Reef.For instance, shading limits the light that can reach marine plants, hindering growth. Or particles might contain metals, sulfur, and chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can dissolve in seawater and become toxic to marine species.However great the damage to Australia’s marine and freshwater ecosystems eventually is, it may be decades before it can be rectified.“The striking thing is just how long the effects of these fires persist,” says Thompson. “The time it takes these systems to recover, particularly in terms of providing a water supply, is in the order of a decade. That’s important because both Sydney and Melbourne’s catchments have been reasonably badly affected by recent fire events.”",
"A platypus is released into Little Yarra River in Victoria, Australia, in 2018.The platypus is one of Australia’s most beloved species—and, seemingly, one of its most resilient. Even as many of the continent’s native fauna declined or disappeared throughout the 20th century, the quirky duck-billed mammal with webbed feet was seen regularly enough that there was little urgency to monitor the animal’s populations. That is, until biologists began to realize the freshwater dwellers weren’t ok, and they probably weren’t all along.“The platypus has declined right in front of our noses,” says Tahneal Hawke, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of New South Wales and a researcher with the Platypus Conservation Initiative.“We have a huge area across the range of the platypus where we literally don't know if they're even there or in what numbers if they are.”Hawke co-authored a new study that surveyed centuries of historical data and suggests the platypus—found in rivers and streams throughout eastern Australia and Tasmania—has been plummeting in number, due to hunting, habitat loss, and climate change.Some scientists started sounding alarms of the platypus’ decline as early as the 1980s, but their warnings fell on deaf ears. Then, as more and more data from long-term monitoring programs set up in the 1980s and ‘90s trickled in, the perception of the ever-stalwart platypus began to dim. (Read more about how the venomous, egg-laying platypus evolved.)“We’ve been monitoring platypus since 1995,” explains Tiana Preston, an environmental water resources planner for the Victoria state agency Melbourne Water, “and the decline is certainly evident.”When the IUCN reassessed the platypus in 2016, the group estimated that populations have dropped by about 30 percent on average overall since Europeans arrived—enough to elevate the animal’s status to “near threatened.”Now, some scientists think that’s an understatement. “There isn't a ton of great data, but the data we have suggests that our estimate of where that baseline is wrong,” says co-author Gilad Bino, a research fellow at the University of New South Wales. “I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers have halved or even more.”Platypus researchers take bill measurements from a platypus captured as part of a study by the agency Melbourne Water in Healesville, Australia.Platypus researcher Joshua Griffiths (left), assisted by Samuel Bell, retrieves a platypus from a net in McMahons Creek, Australia. The animal was measured, checked for a microchip, and promptly returned to the water.Gilad Bino (left) and Tahneal Hawke, both of the University of New South Wales' Platypus Conservation Initiative, examine an anesthetized platypus, which was fitted with a temporary radio transponder to track its movements.How did such losses slip below the radar? Part of the reason is platypuses are shy, nocturnal creatures that are difficult to find and count, so not seeing them doesn’t stand out as strange. But mostly, declines seem to have missed because the animals were considered common enough that no one kept tabs on them. Over time, everyone forgot how many there used to be, so they just assumed the numbers hadn’t changed much—a phenomenon known in ecology as a shifting baseline.Not only is the platypus an important freshwater carnivore, it is an evolutionary gem, one of the last remaining monotremes—or egg-laying mammals—left on Earth. And we’ve only begun to discover its wealth of secrets, from life-saving antibiotics in its milk to potential diabetes cures in its venom.When Europeans came to Australia in the 17th century, platypuses became a favorite of fur traders for their soft, waterproof skins, and business boomed for centuries until hunting was outlawed in the early 20th century.“There was one particular record that we found that suggested a single furrier had sold 29,000 platypus skins,” Hawke says.The animals continued to be seen in the same watersheds, with the exception of severe losses in South Australia. That’s why, in that state, the platypus is listed as endangered, but it’s not covered under any federal threatened species legislation.Though it may seem surprising that such intense hunting didn’t seem to lead to drastic declines, Hawke says we weren’t getting the full picture.For one, it’s hard to say how much a species has declined without a solid idea of how many animals there used to be. And rigorous research into platypus populations is spotty both geographically and historically. (Related: "Platypus genome reveals secrets of mammalian evolution.")Part of that is logistical. “Platypus are notoriously difficult to study,” says Preston. They’re shy and nocturnal, so daytime surveys tend to miss them. And other methods for tracking species—like track or scat examination—don’t work because the animals spend most of their time in the water. (Explore the overlooked world of freshwater animals.)Now, researchers are tapping into technologies like environmental DNA testing to pick up their presence in the water and acoustic tagging to follow their movements. There’s even an app called PlatypusSpot that allows citizen scientists to record sightings. But none of that can tell researchers what their populations were like before 1980—or 1780, for that matter.For the study, Hawke and colleagues dug through 258 years’ worth of historical documents—over 11,000 records in all—to piece together what she could about the animals’ past numbers and distribution, and then compared that with all the modern data they could find, including reports of sightings through PlatypusSPOT.Though she couldn’t calculate firm numbers from such variable data, the trend was clear—there are a lot fewer platypuses now than there once were. Places where, a century ago, a dozen or two of the animals could be caught in a day now yield less than a handful after exhaustive nighttime surveying, if researchers are lucky.“For species like platypus, whose population declines happened before ecologists started studying them, these types of historical observations are extremely valuable,” says Loren McClenachan, a historical ecologist with Maine's Colby College who was not involved in the study. “It is an excellent use of historical data to understand the population dynamics of an iconic species.”But not everyone agrees. Peter Temple-Smith and Frank Carrick are among a group of platypus researchers who think the historical sources are just too unreliable to make claims about past populations. They say more robust surveys are needed to determine if areas with fewer reported sightings really have fewer animals.“Historical reports can be very important to understanding current ecology, but do require considerable care in interpretation,” says Carrick.Bino agrees that it’s tough to reconcile such disparate types of data, but says the team’s goal was never to put some exact number on how much the animals have declined.“There's value and merit in reporting old observations, even if they didn't follow any systematic surveys,” he says, and in this case especially, such work “highlights significant knowledge gaps.”In general, though, experts are on the same page that platypuses are struggling and will continue to decline if nothing changes.For instance, Hawke and colleagues are researching how large dams impact platypuses; if managed poorly, a single dam can essentially wipe out the platypuses living above and below it, according to their preliminary data.Understanding the nuances of threats like this will help researchers determine the best ways to protect the animals. (Read more about threats to freshwater wildlife.)“We are all concerned that it continues to be conserved as a flagship species for eastern Australian waterways after 160 million years of evolution—especially since it is the last extant species of its evolutionary line,” says Temple-Smith.And the odd-looking creatures aren’t just loved by scientists.“Everyone that you meet, they have this story about when they've seen a platypus in the wild,” says Preston. “And when they tell the story, they light up…[but] it’s becoming rarer and rarer for kids to have that.”",
"A wealth of water—up to 1.6 million gallons a second—pours over Iguaçu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina.We keep an eye out for wonders, my daughter and I, every morning as we walk down our farm lane to meet the school bus. And wherever we find them, they reflect the magic of water: a spider web drooping with dew like a rhinestone necklace. A rain-colored heron rising from the creek bank. One astonishing morning, we had a visitation of frogs. Dozens of them hurtled up from the grass ahead of our feet, launching themselves, white-bellied, in bouncing arcs, as if we'd been caught in a downpour of amphibians. It seemed to mark the dawning of some new aqueous age. On another day we met a snapping turtle in his primordial olive drab armor. Normally this is a pond-locked creature, but some murky ambition had moved him onto our gravel lane, using the rainy week as a passport from our farm to somewhere else.The little, nameless creek tumbling through our hollow holds us in thrall. Before we came to southern Appalachia, we lived for years in Arizona, where a permanent runnel of that size would merit a nature preserve. In the Grand Canyon State, every license plate reminded us that water changes the face of the land, splitting open rock desert like a peach, leaving mile-deep gashes of infinite hue. Cities there function like space stations, importing every ounce of fresh water from distant rivers or fossil aquifers. But such is the human inclination to take water as a birthright that public fountains still may bubble in Arizona's town squares and farmers there raise thirsty crops. Retirees from rainier climes irrigate green lawns that impersonate the grasslands they left behind. The truth encroaches on all the fantasies, though, when desert residents wait months between rains, watching cacti tighten their belts and roadrunners skirmish over precious beads from a dripping garden faucet. Water is life. It's the briny broth of our origins, the pounding circulatory system of the world, a precarious molecular edge on which we survive. It makes up two-thirds of our bodies, just like the map of the world; our vital fluids are saline, like the ocean. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.Even while we take Mother Water for granted, humans understand in our bones that she is the boss. We stake our civilizations on the coasts and mighty rivers. Our deepest dread is the threat of having too little moisture—or too much. We've lately raised the Earth's average temperature by .74°C (1.3°F), a number that sounds inconsequential. But these words do not: flood, drought, hurricane, rising sea levels, bursting levees. Water is the visible face of climate and, therefore, climate change. Shifting rain patterns flood some regions and dry up others as nature demonstrates a grave physics lesson: Hot air holds more water molecules than cold.The results are in plain sight along pummeled coasts from Louisiana to the Philippines as super­warmed air above the ocean brews superstorms, the likes of which we have never known. In arid places the same physics amplify evaporation and drought, visible in the dust-dry farms of the Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia. On top of the Himalaya, glaciers whose meltwater sustains vast populations are dwindling. The snapping turtle I met on my lane may have been looking for higher ground. Last summer brought us a string of floods that left tomatoes blighted on the vine and our farmers needing disaster relief for the third consecutive year. The past decade has brought us more extreme storms than ever before, of the kind that dump many inches in a day, laying down crops and utility poles and great sodden oaks whose roots cannot find purchase in the saturated ground. The word "disaster" seems to mock us. After enough repetitions of shocking weather, we can't remain indefinitely shocked.How can the world shift beneath our feet? All we know is founded on its rhythms: Water will flow from the snowcapped mountains, rain and sun will arrive in their proper seasons. Humans first formed our tongues around language, surely, for the purpose of explaining these constants to our children. What should we tell them now? That "reliable" has been rained out, or died of thirst? When the Earth seems to raise its own voice to the pitch of a gale, have we the ears to listen?A world away from my damp hollow, the Bajo Piura Valley is a great bowl of the driest Holocene sands I've ever gotten in my shoes. Stretching from coastal, northwestern Peru into southern Ecuador, the 14,000-square-mile Piura Desert is home to many endemic forms of thorny life. Profiles of this eco-region describe it as dry to drier, and Bajo Piura on its southern edge is what anyone would call driest. Between January and March it might get close to an inch of rain, depending on the whims of El Nino, my driver explained as we bumped over the dry bed of the Ro Piura, "but in some years, nothing at all." For hours we passed through white-crusted fields ruined by years of irrigation and then into eye-burning valleys beyond the limits of endurance for anything but sparse stands of the deep-rooted Prosopis pallida,arguably nature's most arid-adapted tree. And remarkably, some scattered families of Homo sapiens.They are economic refugees, looking for land that costs nothing. In Bajo Piura they find it, although living there has other costs, and fragile drylands pay their own price too, as people exacerbate desertification by cutting anything living for firewood. What brought me there, as a journalist, was an innovative reforestation project. Peruvian conservationists, partnered with the NGO Heifer International, were guiding the population into herding goats, which eat the protein-rich pods of the native mesquite and disperse its seeds over the desert. In the shade of a stick shelter, a young mother set her dented pot on a dung-fed fire and showed how she curdles goat's milk into white cheese. But milking goats is hard to work into her schedule when she, and every other woman she knows, must walk about eight hours a day to collect water.Their husbands were digging a well nearby. They worked with hand trowels, a plywood form for lining the shaft with concrete, inch by inch, and a sturdy hand-built crank for lowering a man to the bottom and sending up buckets of sand. A dozen hopeful men in stained straw hats stood back to let me inspect their work, which so far had yielded only a mountain of exhumed sand, dry as dust. I looked down that black hole, then turned and climbed the sand mound to hide my unprofessional tears. I could not fathom this kind of perseverance and wondered how long these beleaguered people would last before they'd had enough of their water woes and moved somewhere else.Five years later they are still bringing up dry sand, scratching out their fate as a microcosm of life on this planet. There is nowhere else. Forty percent of the households in sub-Saharan Africa are more than a half hour from the nearest water, and that distance is growing. Australian farmers can't follow the rainfall patterns that have shifted south to fall on the sea. A salmon that runs into a dam when homing in on her natal stream cannot make other plans. Together we dig in, for all we're worth.Since childhood I've heard it's possible to look up from the bottom of a well and see stars, even in daylight. Aristotle wrote about this, and so did Charles Dickens. On many a dark night the vision of that round slip of sky with stars has comforted me. Here's the only problem: It's not true. Western civilization was in no great hurry to give up this folklore; astronomers believed it for centuries, but a few of them eventually thought to test it and had their illusions dashed by simple observation.Civilization has been similarly slow to give up on our myth of the Earth's infinite generosity. Declining to look for evidence to the contrary, we just knew it was there. We pumped aquifers and diverted rivers, trusting the twin lucky stars of unrestrained human expansion and endless supply. Now water tables plummet in countries harboring half the world's population. Rather grandly, we have overdrawn our accounts.In 1968 the ecologist Garrett Hardin wrote a paper called "The Tragedy of the Commons," required reading for biology students ever since. It addresses the problems that can be solved only by "a change in human values or ideas of morality" in situations where rational pursuit of individual self-interest leads to collective ruin. Cattle farmers who share a common pasture, for example, will increase their herds one by one until they destroy the pasture by overgrazing. Agreeing to self-imposed limits instead, unthinkable at first, will become the right thing to do. While our laws imply that morality is fixed, Hardin made the point that "the morality of an act is a function of the state of the system at the time it is performed." Surely it was no sin, once upon a time, to shoot and make pies of passenger pigeons.Water is the ultimate commons. Watercourses once seemed as boundless as those pigeons that darkened the sky overhead, and the notion of protecting water was as silly as bottling it. But rules change. Time and again, from New Mexico's antique irrigation codes to the UN Convention on International Watercourses, communities have studied water systems and redefined wise use. Now Ecuador has become the first nation on Earth to put the rights of nature in its constitution so that rivers and forests are not simply property but maintain their own right to flourish. Under these laws a citizen might file suit on behalf of an injured watershed, recognizing that its health is crucial to the common good. Other nations may follow Ecuador's lead. Just as legal systems once reeled to comprehend women or former slaves as fully entitled, law schools in the U.S. are now reforming their curricula with an eye to understanding and acknowledging nature's rights.On my desk, a glass of water has caught the afternoon light, and I'm still looking for wonders. Who owns this water? How can I call it mine when its fate is to run through rivers and living bodies, so many already and so many more to come? It is an ancient, dazzling relic, temporarily quarantined here in my glass, waiting to return to its kind, waiting to move a mountain. It is the gold standard of biological currency, and the good news is that we can conserve it in countless ways. Also, unlike petroleum, water will always be with us. Our trust in Earth's infinite generosity was half right, as every raindrop will run to the ocean, and the ocean will rise into the firmament. And half wrong, because we are not important to water. It's the other way around. Our task is to work out reasonable ways to survive inside its boundaries. We'd be wise to fix our sights on some new stars. The gentle nudge of evidence, the guidance of science, and a heart for protecting the commons: These are the tools of a new century. Taking a wide-eyed look at a watery planet is our way of knowing the stakes, the better to know our place.",
"Platypuses hunt underwater, where they swim gracefully by paddling with their front webbed feet and steering with their hind feet and beaverlike tail.If there was a poster animal for diversification, it would have to be the platypus. It looks like an otter that’s gone trick-or-treating as a duck.It’s a mashup that inspired Mark Anthony Libre to ask Weird Animal Question of the Week: "How did [the platypus] evolve in this unlikely fashion?”The platypus is an Australian mammal with some weirdly reptilian traits, like egg laying.While we think of mammals and reptiles as very different, at one time they shared a common ancestor, says Wes Warren of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.Warren led the 2008 study that found that the platypus has a "fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters." (Related: "Platypus Genome Reveals Secrets of Mammalian Evolution.")Mammal-like reptiles diverged from the lineage they shared with birds and reptiles about 280 million years ago.Around 80 million years later, the monotremes—or egg-laying mammals—split off from the mammalian lineage, says Rebecca Young, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin.Venomous males have sharp stingers on the heels of their rear feet and can use them to deliver a strong blow.All that remains of that branch of the family tree is the platypus and four species of echidna. (Related: "Which Animals Have Barely Evolved?")This split happened before the evolution of the placenta, Young says, “so in that sense they are somewhere between a lizard and what we think of as a human-like placental mammal,” retaining some reptilian and mammalian features.Though monotremes' fossil record is limited, some skulls have been found, such as the extinct Obdurodon dicksoni. The creature, which lived during the Miocene period (about 23.3 million to 5.3 million years ago), has a similar snout to the modern-day platypus, but is likely not close kin.While modern platypuses are down under, fossil evidence also shows that an ancient platypus lived in South America.A zookeeper cradles rare twin platypus babies, which are known as puggles, at Healesville Sanctuary in Australia.But why platypuses “stopped evolving and losing these components that make a mammal a mammal,” remains a mystery, says Warren.The platypus's milk seeps through pores in its abdomen, not through teats as in all other mammals. Another incredible adaptation is how they forage for food. Platypuses close their eyes, ears, and noses underwater and find prey by sensing electric currents with their ducklike bills.Their venom is located in a spur in the males' heels—a unique method of delivery among venomous creatures. (Also see "Venomous Primate Discovered in Borneo.")These bottom feeders scoop up insects, larvae, shellfish, and worms in their bill along with bits of gravel and mud. Platypuses do not have teeth, so the bits of gravel help them to "chew" their meal.Warren led a 2010 study that found 83 toxins in platypus venom, which contains genes that resemble the venom genes of other animals, including snakes, starfish, and spiders. It's likely an example of convergent evolution, in which unrelated species evolve similar traits.So while many things about the platypus remain mysterious. Young notes that there is "some randomness to how we acquire things over time," plus mutations and adaptations that happen more quickly.Weird Animal Question of the Week answers your questions every Saturday.

"“From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders,” said the pioneering undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau. “He is bolted to earth. But man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free.”Source of both much of our food and some of our fears, the sea has forever sustained and threatened humans. Since the dawn of the industrial era, it has also increasingly been a site of exploration. Advances in technology have helped us better understand what lies below, and, in the 1940s, the advent of Cousteau and Émile Gagnan’s Aqua-Lung forever changed our relationship with the sea. Now, free to experience that sense of liberation described by Cousteau, humans feel more at home submerged—we are, after all, more than 50 percent water.But for underwater photographers, that sense of freedom comes with challenges. They must quickly get comfortable with uncomfortable situations requiring working with little light and limited air. The reward is pictures like those in this gallery, which appear like postcards from another world.Members of our Your Shot photography community take us on a trip underwater through their camera lenses, not only into the world’s oceans but also to cenotes in Mexico, a river in Switzerland, and an Austrian lake. Along the way, we meet creatures both great and small, from humpback whales to a skeleton shrimp. The photographers let us peek into a different world but, as witnesses to climate change's affects on the oceans, also provide us with a glimpse into an uncertain future.Join the Your Shot community, and share a photo of somewhere that's meaningful to you.",
"A swimmer floats through sun-streaked water in one of the Yucatán Peninsula's many limestone sinkholes.Beneath lush greenery, Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula is like Swiss cheese. The bedrock is pocked with thousands of sinkholes, formed when limestone collapses and cool groundwater seeps in.In centuries past, the Maya relied on cenotes for freshwater and believed they were portals to the gods. Now divers explore the depths, but you don’t need special certifications to enjoy the pools at the surface.Down a dirt road fringed by jungle, Dos Ojos Cenote was almost ready to close by the time we got there. Divers in wet suits and kids in swimsuits trundled out into the parking lot, but—happily—the clerk let us in. Down the creaky wooden steps that led into the pool, we discovered we were completely alone.We sank into the 76°F water, illuminated in gem-tone shades of blue and green by the late afternoon light. Our hushed voices echoed against the cave ceiling, which swept over our heads like a grand opera house.Below, rock formations sank away into a 30-foot-deep pool, while passages led much deeper. We floated and breast stroked until our fingers were wrinkly, taking in the delicate stillness of this singular window into the Earth.A couple of days later, we visited Gran Cenote and found a very different experience: a lively party. Families and couples picnicked on a small lawn as we descended stairs to the sunlit pool, teeming with snorkelers. Through our masks, we watched fish and turtles circle stalactites and stalagmites. About 30 feet below, divers’ headlamps lit the craggy depths.We finned back and forth then warmed up aboveground with others who had come to delight in the luminous pleasures and wild wonders of this stone-rimmed pool in the jungle.",
"A government official adjusts an irrigation door in southeastern Australia.In the developed world there is really nothing natural about the way we get our water. Dams produce hydroelectric power and the reservoirs behind dams store water supplies for the long haul. Infrastructure, such as levees and canals, channel water to our homes and fields, and keep rivers running the course we want them to.Dams, levees, and canals dot the developing world too. In some areas communities still use ancient water storage infrastructures and rely on centuries-old canals for irrigation.While most agree that water infrastructure—either large- or small-scale—is critical to human civilization, there is also a theory that much of our large-scale water-related infrastructure—such as dams and levees—is not worth the environmental costs, which include fish kills, altered floodplains, increased flooding, and degraded water quality.Dam building has experienced a resurgence, while at the same time a dam removal movement is gaining momentum in some areas. Over the last decade, some 430 dams have been removed from U.S. rivers, opening up habitat for fisheries, restoring healthier flows, improving water quality, and returning life to rivers.Infrastructure may help us deal with the effects of climate change—rainstorms becoming more intense, but less frequent—by providing increased storage capacity and flood control, but we need to find ways to use dams, canals, and levees, that don’t harm aquatic species and ecosystems, and jeopardize our long-term safety.",
"The world's largest freshwater fish, the Arapima gigas, swims in its natural habitat in the Amazon Rainforest. The fish is endangered due to overfishing.Freshwater ecosystems are essential for human survival, providing the majority of people's drinking water. The ecosystems are home to more than 40 percent of the world's fish species. Despite their value and importance, many lakes, rivers, and wetlands around the world are being severely damaged by human activities and are declining at a much faster rate than terrestrial ecosystems.More than 20 percent of the 10,000 known freshwater fish species have become extinct or imperiled in recent decades. Watersheds, which catch precipitation and channel it to streams and lakes, are highly vulnerable to pollution. Programs to protect freshwater habitats include planning, stewardship, education, and regulation.",
"A handmade wood canvas canoe glides into a secret bay lined with golden tamaracks in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.With a million acres of woods and a thousand lakes, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota’s Superior National Forest is one of America’s most iconic natural preserves.Each year, the BWCAW attracts 155,000 visitors, with many reserving passes years in advance. The appeal? Going completely off grid to camp and canoe along wildlife-rich shores.But the wilderness is now facing challenges that threaten to erode the reasons people come here in the first place. Long an existential threat, a controversial copper-nickel mine with the potential to cause irreparable environmental harm is poised to become a reality. The mine, coupled with pandemic crowds leaving a trail of damage, are raising concerns over the Boundary Waters’s future as a sanctuary for visitors and a vital economic engine for locals.(Related: Avoid the crowds at these 10 least-visited national parks.)The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness looking north along the border with Canada’s companion Quetico Provincial Park. The well-known Prairie Portage is in the upper left.“Fifty years ago, I made my first photograph of gray wolves here,” says photographer and Minnesota native Jim Brandenburg. “Today I still feel the same humbled thrill when that rare opportunity arises.”The BWCAW isn’t just a haven for nature lovers; it’s a trove of precious metals used to make a wide range of products, from electronics to roof gutters and aircraft engines. One of the richest loads—four billion tons of copper and nickel—is buried deep within the Duluth Complex, an ancient rock formation along Lake Superior that extends from the city of Duluth to the northeastern tip of Minnesota. It’s an area that Twin Metals, a subsidiary of Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, has spent years trying to tap via a proposed underground sulfide-ore copper mine.If approved, the mine would be located a few miles from the southern edge of the Boundary Waters, not far from Ely, a town of 3,356 people filled with outfitters and key entry points to the wilderness. Another company, PolyMet, has secured permits to build a mine near Lake Superior, outside of the BWCAW watershed. But that project has stalled for now due to scrutiny over how regulators handled the process.Opponents say that the type of mining Twin Metals wants to do results in heavy metal runoff that would cause irreparable damage to the BWCAW’s lakes and rivers. Led by Northeastern Minnesotans for Wilderness (NMW), the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters has filed several lawsuits to stop the mine.The area is “critical habitat” for endangered animals including the Canadian lynx, gray wolf, and moose, notes Marc Fink, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is part of the coalition. “We definitely feel that the proposal for a copper mine outside the BWCAW is [the wilderness’s] biggest threat in a number of ways,” he adds.(Related: A proposed copper mine in Alaska puts a pristine wilderness at risk.)Before the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act was passed in 1978, the Bureau of Land Management issued two 20-year mineral leases with the option for three 10-year renewals related to the Rainy River Watershed, which houses the BWCAW. Twin Metals acquired those leases in 2012 and applied to renew them a few years later. But President Barack Obama rejected the application in 2016. That was reversed after President Donald Trump came into office. He granted the renewal in 2017, a move that’s part of his administration’s efforts to roll back a slew of environmental laws.Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul says the company’s proposal, which is currently under environmental review, includes advanced technologies like the dry stack method “to protect the environment and minimize the project’s impact.” The method removes most of the water content from waste rock pulled from the ground. The resulting sand-like “tailings” are then piled into a lined storage facility.While some environmentalists say dry stack storing is safer than the traditional method of storing tailings in a pond with a dam, Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness, isn’t convinced. “This specific type of copper-nickel mining has never been done [here] before, so there are a lot of reasons why we oppose these mines,” says Pete Marshall, a spokesperson for the organization, which is a co-plaintiff with Save the Boundary Waters on two lawsuits against Twin Metals.The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness brings visitors up close to nature. Here, common loons start the day with a stretch.The town of Ely was built on mining, but residents today are split on the proposed mine, which would be Ely’s first in 50 years. Some say the potential environmental damage is too great a risk for tourism businesses. Others welcome additional jobs that wouldn’t depend on the seasons. Graul says Twin Metals “expects to directly employ more than 750 people long term in northeastern Minnesota and to create an estimated 1,500 spinoff jobs in other industries.”But even if the project did create that many additional jobs, they would be short lived. A study by a Harvard economist determined that “the economic benefits of mining would be outweighed by the negative impact of mining on the recreational industry and on in-migration,” considering the boom-bust nature of mining jobs.Though the Trump Administration’s decision to renew the leases is helping to push Twin Metals’ project along, the regulatory review process and lawsuits puts the mine several years out at best. In the meantime, opponents like Marshall continue to add hurdles with plans like “prove-it-first” legislation, modeled after a similar Wisconsin law that was repealed in 2017. This January, Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum introduced H.R. 5598, which aims to permanently protect 234,328 acres within the Boundary Waters watershed from copper mining. The bill is currently in subcommittee, but Rebecca Rom, national chair of NMW, says she believes it will pass the House this year.Although Marshall believes that organizations like his will succeed in stopping Twin Metals, he says it would be a temporary victory. “The challenge with any kind of environmental battle is that the copper is still going to be there. It will always be that valuable resource that will attract powerful companies and powerful interests,” he says. “We’ll have to be on guard indefinitely.”“A wolf is fed by its feet,” says Brandenburg. Wolves can easily travel 30 miles in a day. The BWCAW is considered critical habitat for endangered gray wolves, says Marc Fink, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.Sunrise on a still autumn morning reveals a field of marsh grass touched by frost.Brandenburg’s birchbark canoe rests by the water before the last paddle of the season. Native Americans devised this near-perfect form of lake transportation.A white-tailed deer buck is always on the lookout for packs of hungry and clever wolves.While the controversy over the mine continues, the Boundary Waters area faces a more immediate problem. A rise in visitation is leading to destruction, which has become all too familiar in public lands as visitors look for wide open spaces in the midst of COVID-19.Forest service officers report visitors are cutting down trees to get better views of lakes, washing with soap in rivers, not using latrines, leaving trash, and failing to store food properly—a dangerous practice that can have tragic consequences for the area’s black bears as well as visitors.(Related: Pandemic crowds are straining this national park.)Ann Schwaller, Boundary Waters program manager for the Superior National Forest, suspects the damage is being caused by an influx of new visitors unfamiliar with the unique qualities of backcountry camping, an issue made worse by enhanced safety measures.Before the pandemic, visitors were exposed to multiple “touch points.” During these face-to-face moments a forest service worker or an outfitter informed and reinforced the “Leave No Trace” ethic for mitigating human impact on natural lands that is essential to visiting the backcountry. Now those moments are mostly gone, replaced by physical distance and contactless processes. Before, visitors were required to pick up entrance passes in person, where they watched videos explaining the rules and then took a quiz. Now those videos come as attachments to emails confirming reservations. Schwaller suspects first-timers are ignoring the videos.A traditional birchbark canoe emerges from the fog.“Perhaps some are more used to developed campgrounds or resorts, so they just aren’t aware,” says Schwaller. “But that’s what the videos are there for and that’s what our trip planning guide is for—to learn before you come. There seems to be a disconnect between the place they’re going to visit and protecting it while they’re there.”Schwaller says staff are doing what they can by responding immediately to damage reports and working closely with outfitters who do come into contact with visitors. But the BWCAW is vast, making it difficult to police. For the most part, Schwaller says prevention is the service’s best option.“We’re talking education and prevention because we’re assuming a lot of these new users are going to come back,” she says, adding that the forest service isn’t planning to pull back permits just yet.For the time being, visitors—both repeat and new—continue to arrive, immersing in what Sigurd Olson, one of the Boundary Waters’s founders, sought to preserve: “an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.”",
"Just north of Amakdedori Beach, cliffs tower over Kamishak Bay, notorious for bad weather and shallow reefs. The beach is the proposed site for Pebble Mine's industrial port, where concentrated minerals would be loaded onto barges and dumped into a ship anchored in the bay.Amakdedori Beach, on the wild western coast of Alaska’s Cook Inlet, is regularly whipped by strong winds, waves, and extreme tides. These forces have amassed an impressive pile of driftwood along the beach, as tall as a cabin in some spots.But on an August afternoon the weather is sunny and calm enough for Kirk Johnson, an accomplished bush pilot and recently retired dentist, to land his Piper PA-12 on a stretch of tundra a couple miles from the shore. His daughter, photographer Acacia Johnson, and I exit and secure the plane to an alder stand to prevent the wind from taking hold of it.Few people have been to remote Amakdedori; its main denizens are bears and wolves, and we thread our way through their tracks on a hike to the shore, past tundra heavy with crowberry and speckled with flowers. On the rocky beach, lapped by the cold Pacific, curious harbor seals approach us. Dominating the horizon 25 miles offshore is Augustine Volcano, which last erupted in 2006.This land has long been used by the Yupik people for subsistence hunting and fishing, which still takes place. “It's one of the most beautiful places in the world,” Kirk says.But if a Canadian mining company gets its way, Amakdedori Beach will become home to a large port at the terminus of a transportation corridor for the proposed Pebble Mine, where containers full of concentrated copper and gold will be barged to a tanker anchored in Kamishak Bay.Amakdedori Beach at low tide. Just to the right of the spot where Amakdedori creek flows into Kamishak Bay, Pebble plans to build a port, which would connect to a road. Extreme tides and waves are frequent at Amakdedori, explaining the driftwood berm visible on the shore.The proposed Pebble Mine has made international headlines for years, in part due to the heated opposition it has ignited in the Bristol Bay region. The area is home to the largest sockeye salmon fishery left in the world, employing more than 14,000 people and generating around $1.5 billion each year in revenue. Opponents fear that mining the Pebble deposit, which sits at the headwaters of two of the most important salmon-producing rivers in the region, would pollute the waters and destroy the species' habitat. Pebble officials maintain it would not have a significant impact on the fish.But while those potential effects have been widely reported, less attention has been paid to the plan to physically get the material from mine to market. The company, Pebble Partnership, has only one viable path. It involves constructing a large, complex transportation corridor, including a natural gas pipeline and 80 miles of roads, in a largely uninhabited and roadless wilderness area.It would also necessitate the construction of two ferry terminals, an ice-breaking boat to carry mineral concentrate across Lake Iliamna, Alaska’s largest, and a third port facility at Amakdedori on Cook Inlet.Opponents argue that the corridor would cause environmental problems—such as disrupting wildlife habitat and migration corridors between two nearby national parks, Katmai and Lake Clark—and present a risk for accidents like spills of toxic metals and other substances such as oil. Copper, for example, is highly toxic to salmon. By increasing accessibility, it could also make it easier to mine in the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposit, which surrounds the Pebble site. Pebble Partnership says impacts on wildlife would be minor, spills could be cleaned up, and long-term effects of the road are not relevant to the current permitting process.This general area is one of the United State’s richest and most unique remaining stretches of wilderness, home to the best bear-viewing spots on Earth, as well as one of the world’s largest and most pristine habitats for all five Pacific salmon species and other sportfish. Many are afraid that such a corridor would seriously degrade the area. (Learn more: Alaska is the best place to see wild bears. A new mine could change that.)“I think it’s vitally important for the planet to have places like this where people can come and experience wilderness,” says Kirk. “Or even just to know such places exist,” says Leslie, his wife. The two were once bear-viewing guides at a camp just south of Amakdedori.Pebble says it’s confident the plan wouldn’t present major environmental risks. “I think we’ve done everything we can to minimize its impact,” says Tom Collier, CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership. “I pushed this corridor because of my belief that it reduced the environmental impact of what had been proposed earlier.”“It’s preposterous,” says Joel Reynolds, an attorney specializing in environmental issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The corridor “resembles a Rube Goldberg machine, fraught with peril, from start to finish.”If the mine is approved, this is roughly what a day in its life would look like. At the mine, about 180,000 tons of rock per day would be blasted out of the ground, crushed, and mixed with various chemicals to create a much smaller amount of concentrated minerals. This concoction, a mixture of crushed rock, concentrated metals, and residual water, would be loaded into containers. The concentrate would be placed on trucks and driven over 29 miles of roads to a port on the northern side of Lake Iliamna, then loaded onto a huge ice-breaking ferry. The ship would make one round trip daily to the port on the other side, 18 miles distant, near the town of Kokhanok, population 170.There, containers would be unloaded onto trucks traveling 37 miles to a port at Amakdedori, then packed onto sea-going barges bound for a large tanker moored more than 10 miles offshore, into which the minerals would be dumped. The containers would then be returned, empty, to the mine.The transportation corridor and some of its potential impacts have been described in the Army Corps of Engineers' draft environmental impact statement, which was published in February. A final statement is expected in summer 2020, and the company hopes to soon thereafter receive a permit signifying compliance with the Clean Water Act, the final major approval the company needs to move forward. Various parts of the project would require further permits from the state, a process that would take about three to four years.However, the Corps' draft statement has been criticized as being scant on details, including on the corridor. “It doesn’t meet standard industry practice,” says Rich Borden, a mining and environmental consultant who worked for Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining companies, for 23 years. That’s shocking, he says, considering, “it’s in the most challenging environmental setting of any mine I’ve ever seen proposed.”The land between Kokhanok and Amakdedori Beach is a vast, undeveloped wilderness. The land is filled with streams and lakes, like this one. Here, Pebble hopes to build a road transporting concentrated metals, which would interfere with wildlife migration, scientists argue.The Department of the Interior, in its official comments on the statement, said, “Based on [several] identified deficiencies, the DEIS is so inadequate that it precludes meaningful analysis.”Collier says federal agencies often have harsh criticism early in such processes to ensure their concerns are taken seriously. Having overseen permitting processes before when he worked with the Department of the Interior, Collier says this statement adequately lays out the company’s steps to minimize impacts.One of the most pointed critiques is that the statement does not address the possibility of a catastrophic release of tailings, a watery mixture of mine waste. Similar mines and tailings dams have given way before. For example, in 2014 the tailings pond at Mount Polley mine in British Columbia breached, sending billions of gallons of toxic wastewater containing lead and arsenic into nearby lakes and streams. Any kind of mass release of tailings from Pebble would be absolutely devastating to the salmon downstream, which form the backbone of the region’s ecology and economy, Reynold says.However, Collier says the mine plan averts the possibility for such a release because most of the tailings would be placed in a dam that would drain through, after which the water would be treated to reduce levels of toxic metals. That would avoid a build up of water, he says, though some scientific experts, including Borden, have disputed whether the design would work as advertised. The water would also have to be managed in perpetuity, which many view as unrealistic. Acidic, watery waste material will be put in a separate smaller, lined earthen dam, Collier says.The area is also geologically active, and geologist Bretwood Higman says Pebble has done “virtually nothing” to document the faults in the area. The nearby, little-studied Lake Clark Fault could run near or even under the project site, and could plausibly produce large earthquakes over the long-term, he added in comments on the impact statement. Those “tailings will continue to pose a danger to downstream waterways long after mining is complete. It is unacceptable to permit any facility that will require any form of perpetual maintenance, including treatment of water, or maintenance of dams,” he says.While the planned size of the mine is scaled down from failed proposals of the past, the corridor is more ambitious, because the company will not be able to pursue the more direct route, along the north of Lake Iliamna. In the past few years the town of Pedro Bay, which would have to consent to such a corridor, has decisively turned against the project, says Jerry Jacques, a bear-viewing company owner and bush pilot who was based in the town for many years. Townspeople fear that the corridor and mine would “destroy their way of life,” he says.Likewise, the Igiugig Native Corporation, which owns the development rights to Diamond Point, the previously-preferred port location, has decided not to allow Pebble to proceed. “They did approach us for a port, but our council said no,” says AlexAnna Salmon, president of the village council of Igiugig, population 69, at the western edge of Lake Iliamna, which controls the corporation.At the same time, the Alaska Peninsula Corporation has tentatively agreed to give Pebble the rights to construct a corridor along its land, including much of the stretch between Kokhanok and Amakdedori. Vice President Brad Angasan says the corporation’s board members have been “forced” into this, due to a lack of jobs and business opportunities, as well as a falling population in the area.Unlike most here, who seem to have a strong position one way or the other, Angasan is more on the fence. “If Pebble passes, fantastic. If not, equally fantastic.” He says he hopes—and is choosing to have faith—that the federal government and the state will help prevent significant negative impacts from the project.Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) school near a bridge at Brooks Camp, in Katmai National Park. The region is the world’s largest nursery for these salmon, and it forms the basis of the area’s ecology and economy. It remains relatively pristine—for now.Environmentalists and locals are worried that spills could happen on the ferry across Lake Iliamna, the world’s single largest contiguous nursery for red salmon and home to a rare population of freshwater seals. Like Amakdedori, high winds roar across the lake and it often freezes in the winter, potentially make a crossing difficult. There’s also a risk for accidents along the roads, certain to become icy during much of the year. The trucks and boats will be hauling highly concentrated metals, like copper, which is toxic to salmon, as well as other unknown chemicals used in the mining process, fuel, and the like.The company says the steel containers will be sealed, and use a state-of-the art design that “minimizes the potential for spills during concentrate transportation,” says Mike Heatwole, Pebble vice president of public affairs. They’ll only be opened once aboard the bulk carrier in Cook Inlet, he adds.But Dennis McLerran, former head of EPA Region 10, which includes Alaska, says, “Even with modern mining technology, accidents and spills happen.”“Things can always breach, depending on the accident scenario,” Borden says.Heatwole insists that the company is doing “everything we can to ensure safe and environmentally responsible operations,” and that “we will have contingencies in place should accidents happen.”“Shipping accidents and oil spills are possible here,” on Lake Iliamna, Higman says, "but [thorough] cleanup would be nearly impossible, given the necessity of bringing resources over land or in an airplane.”Further south, the road between Kokhanok and Amakdedori Beach would carry an average of 35 trucks per day, with one passing every 18 minutes.That could interfere with subsistence activities, says Christina Salmon, AlexAnna’s sister, also an Igiugig Village Council board member. “We don’t feel they have the right to build a road through our traditional hunting and fishing grounds.”But as Collier reiterates, development rights to much of the land are controlled by the cooperative Alaska Peninsula Corporation.The road would pass through an important wildlife corridor between Katmai National Park in the south and Lake Clark National Park in the north. Dave Crowley, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who oversees the region, says this area is prime bear-denning territory. (Read more: Alaska is the best place to see wild bears. A new mine could change that.)Every summer, millions of people around the world watch a webcam broadcasting from Brooks Falls, in Katmai, where dozens of brown bears congregate. The peninsula itself is home to around 10,000 brown bears, the densest grouping of bears on Earth.The pristine coastline of Lake Iliamna, Alaska's largest lake, which Pebble’s proposed ferry would cross. At over a thousand square miles, this wild ecosystem is home to numerous tribal groups and one of the world's only freshwater seal species. It’s the largest contiguous nursery for red salmon in the world.Bear researchers fear a road could disrupt the movement of the animals, especially those that show up at McNeil River Falls 13 miles south of Amakdedori, widely considered to be one of the best bear-viewing spots in the world. The road would come within less than a mile of the McNeil River State Game Refuge at its closest. Bears range many miles throughout the course of their lives. They can cover 20 miles in a week, and straight-line travels of 80 miles or more over the course of a year are not uncommon, says Grant Hilderbrand, a large-mammal ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who has studied bears for 25 years.They’re also worried that interactions with bears could change their nature, teaching the animals to associate people with food. Heatwole says Pebble is actively working with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to address the concerns, to prevent road collisions and the bears from getting access to food.This section of road passes many streams—more than 200, according to Rachel James, an organizer with the environmental group Salmon State who walked the route of the proposed corridor last fall between Amakdedori and Kokhanok, taking pictures and notes on her travels.“I cannot emphasize enough how many streams it crosses,” James says. “The impacts to salmon would be incredible. Everywhere you step it’s headwater streams, salmon-bearing streams.”A flight over the proposed route reveals that it would be a massive undertaking. The land is wet, rocky, and mostly uninhabited, except for isolated cabins and the towns of Kokhanok, on the south side of the lake, and Newhalen and Iliamna on the north side, with a combined population of under 300.Borden says the corridor would add to costs that already make the project unfeasible, suggesting that the company would have to enlarge the mine to be profitable. Pebble has admitted that they would like to—the current plan is to leave more than 80 percent of the ore in the ground—but says they’d have to go through a whole new permitting process if that were to take place.The last time the company provided estimates for the costs of infrastructure was in 2011 with the release of the Wardrop Report. At that time, the company suggested that a different version of the infrastructure corridor would cost around $700 million in today’s dollars to construct, with annual transportation costs of $50 million per year, Borden says.Pebble has not released an economic feasibility study, or an estimate for how much the corridor would cost.Another worry is that a transportation corridor would open up the whole region to mining; the mineral vein in the Pebble deposit is part of is the largest such deposit in the world. The land is riddled with mining claims, which are worth very little if the material cannot be physically removed, Reynolds says.“If you were to develop all of those (additional claims), the risk would expand exponentially,” says Dennis McLerran.He oversaw EPA Region 10 when the department issued a 2014 ruling that effectively halted Pebble’s continuation, because the agency concluded the project presented an unacceptable level of risk to salmon in the Bristol Bay watershed. That ruling was overturned by the EPA in July, which was announced internally shortly after President Trump met with governor Mike Dunleavy, who supports the project.McLerran fears that a corridor could open the land to subsequent mining and developments that could cause “death by a thousand cuts,” as has happened in other formerly robust salmon fisheries in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.“Yes we need mining and mining has hazards, but you pick your locations where you decide the risk is acceptable,” McLerran says. “This is one of those locations where we shouldn’t be taking that risk with what we know.”The Pebble permitting process has so far had its fair share of oversights, says attorney Roger Flynn, part of a larger pattern.“Like other large mining projects, such as the Rosemont open-pit copper mine in Arizona, the Corps continues to take a ‘blinders on’ approach to its review of the Pebble Project, and its massive potential impacts to the Alaskan environment,” says Flynn, director of the Western Mining Action Project, a legal center focused on mining in the western states, and an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado School of Law.Back at Amakdedori, Kirk Johnson recalls one sunny day in the 1980s when, as a bear guide, he anchored a boat at the beach. After leaving to explore nearby, a storm blew up without warning, with winds going from virtually nonexistent to 80 miles per hour in 20 minutes, he says. Before he could get back to the vessel, the storm wrecked it on the shore.Amakdedori’s location exposes it to so-called gap winds, where pressure differentials on either side of the Aleutian Range can cause fierce gales, especially in winter.At the port, barges would bring material to and from tankers anchored in Kamishak Bay, which has a series of reefs and shallows. Bob Shavelson, who runs the environmental organization Cook Inletkeeper, says, “It’s one of the nastiest places for running a boat. It’s one of the most unforgiving navigational settings in the world.”Shavelson and others worry that high winds, waves, and extreme tides, which can fluctuate as much as 30 feet, could cause barges to run aground in the reef-ridden bay.“It’s a lousy, awful place to put a port,” says Rick Halford, a long-time Republican politician and former state Senate president who has become an open critic of the mine. “It won’t work.”Pebble strenuously disagrees, pointing out that it has an alternative location for loading tankers, “should the weather prevent loading at our primary site,” Heatwole says, although both are 12 miles or more from the port site. “Should operations preclude loading at both sites we have sufficient storage space and containers in the project plan to account for weather disruptions.”“It’s going to work,” Collier says. “Why would it not work?”Abe Williams, a commercial fisherman who’s also Pebble’s director of regional affairs, makes a comparison to Saint Paul Island, in the middle of the Bering Sea, where crab boats regularly dock even in extreme weather and cold. If it can be done there, it can be done here, he says. But accidents at Saint Paul are not unheard of, and those boats don’t carry large quantities of potentially toxic material in a rich wilderness.“The notion that weather and topography could hinder your ability to design something that would accommodate your needs is, to me, absurd,” he says.The Johnsons disagree. “A mine here just doesn’t make sense,” says Leslie.“We need to protect the planet from further loss of beautiful places,” Kirk says.",
"Sockeye salmon return from the ocean to their natal stream near Iliamna Lake, downstream from the proposed Pebble mine site.On a Thursday in October, dozens of Alaskans piled into a cavernous airplane hangar in the remote village of Iliamna to discuss — yet again — the fate of the proposed Pebble Mine. Seventeen miles to the northwest, underneath snaking rivers and spongy bogs, lies one of the largest undeveloped deposits of copper and gold in North America. Mining companies have been exploring it for decades. But many fear that an open pit mine here, at the headwaters of two of the last great salmon rivers on Earth, will harm fish — and the people who depend on them.In 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency moved to impose restrictions that would have blocked plans for a large mine, citing the impacts on fish-bearing streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. But the mine’s backers sued, putting the restrictions on hold. Now, Northern Dynasty Minerals, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnerships, may get another shot under the Trump administration. Following a meeting between Pebble executives and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt in May, the agency settled the lawsuit and announced plans to abandon the Obama-era restrictions.EPA officials were in Iliamna to hear what the public thought of the reversal. According to local news reports, a few attendees spoke up in favor of the mine, but many residents of the region — including more than 80 percent of its Native Alaskan population — are strongly against it. “It’s not acceptable in any form,” says Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay. Native Alaskans depend on salmon and other wild foods for both physical and spiritual sustenance, she says. “If the environment is harmed, therefore our people are harmed.”Many commercial fishers in Bristol Bay, which boasts the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world, also oppose the mine, along with environmental groups and even some of Alaska’s normally pro-resource political figures. “Their problem is one of location, and that’s never going to change,” says Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They are just sitting at the headwaters of this incredibly productive ecosystem.”Yet an uncomfortable truth underpins this debate: America — and the world — has a voracious appetite for minerals, including copper and gold. And that appetite is projected to grow. A recent study found that global copper demand could increase by as much as 350 percent by 2050, exhausting current reserves sometime between 2035 and 2045.Keeping pace will almost certainly require opening new mines, says Thomas Graedel, a retired industrial ecologist at Yale University and an author of the study. He understands why many people take a skeptical view of mining; the industry has a long history of abusing workers and the environment. But he doesn’t see an alternative. “We can’t imagine a world that we would like that doesn’t have active mining,” Graedel says.The question, then, isn’t whether to mine. It’s where to mine — and how to do it better.Economic geologists are fond of pointing out that if you can’t grow it, you have to mine it. And indeed, mined products are everywhere in modern life — in tin cans, smart phones, and even toothpaste (which contains crushed up minerals like calcite and mica). The USGS estimates that, in a lifetime, the average American will use more than 5,600 pounds of aluminum, almost 20,000 pounds of phosphate rock (mostly as crop fertilizer) and nearly 30,000 pounds of iron ore, to say nothing of all the plastics made from oil that had to be extracted from the ground.The metals in question at Pebble include gold and molybdenum, but the biggest product would be copper. Today, humans consume more than 20 million metric tons of copper per year, making it one of the most widely used metals. Most copper goes into wiring, plumbing, and infrastructure, including bridges, water treatment plants, and the electrical grid. Copper is also used in building construction, appliances, and electronic equipment, among other applications.Unless scientists come up with a suitable replacement, demand for copper will grow as the world’s population increases and more people attain higher standards of living, Graedel says. “There is very good evidence that affluent people go out and buy stuff, and that stuff takes resources,” he says. The more equitably the word develops, the more copper we will need, his study found.Green technologies, from solar panels to wind turbines, also require a lot of copper. Every electric car contains more than 150 pounds of it. As a result, a recent World Bank report concluded that limiting climate change to 2 degrees Celsius would increase copper demand by roughly 150 percent.Recycling could help meet some of this increased demand, but the potential is limited, Graedel says. The problem is that copper often goes into products that last a long time. When they do reach the end of their useful lives, about half of that copper is already reclaimed, but that satisfies less than a fifth of current demand. “Even if we are 100 percent efficient on what comes out of use,” Graedel says, “we will never have enough solely from that source to meet demand.”Unfortunately, the troubling environmental legacy of metal mines is also long-lasting. Sediments in Lake Superior hint at pollution from 6,000-year-old Native American copper mines on Isle Royale. In the Sierra Nevada, some fish still contain unsafe levels of the mercury used to extract gold during the California Gold Rush. And across the American West, abandoned mines continue to leach acid and heavy metals from waste rock and tailings — the crushed material left over after the metals have been extracted from ore.Mining has gotten cleaner in recent decades, says Robert Seal, a geologist with the US Geological Survey. Companies have come up with new ways to process ore and extract metals. They sometimes neutralize rock waste containing sulfide minerals, which are usually the culprit behind acid mine drainage, and they regularly treat wastewater before it flows into the environment. “There have been improvements all across the board,” Seal says. But there’s still a lot of room for improvement.Storing tailings as a wet slurry in contained ponds, as Pebble has proposed to do, helps reduce acid drainage. But it’s also the most common source of modern mining accidents. In August 2014, in the mountains of British Columbia, a dam burst at the Mount Polley mine, releasing muddy water contaminated with mine waste into rivers and lakes inhabited by Chinook salmon and rainbow trout. And in 2015, a dam failure at an iron ore mine in Brazil flooded entire villages and killed at least 11 people.Nushagak Bay, downstream from the proposed mine at the mouth of the Nushagak River, is the site of a rich salmon fishery.The root cause of such disasters is often more political than technical, says Erica Schoenberger, a geographer at Johns Hopkins University. In a 2016 study, Schoenberger analyzed three different mines — including Mount Polley — to understand why some fail while others succeed. “It seemed to me that what was standing between the engineers and safe mining, if not beautiful mining, was the regulatory structure and the corporate structure,” she says. In other words, engineers know how to manage tailings safely, but their advice often goes unheeded.Under the right conditions, though, mines can work well. The McLaughlin gold mine in California, which Schoenberger cites as a model, was bound by the state’s stringent laws, but even more by the high stakes of operating near Napa County’s wine country. To reduce the chances of an accident, the Homestake mining company built its tailings dam to standards that far exceeded state regulations. It also converted the mine to a nature reserve after it closed in 2002.Schoenberger says that engineers now have even better options, albeit more expensive ones, for storing tailings safely, like drying and stacking them into stable, covered piles. A post-mortem of the Mount Polley accident concluded that subjecting tailings facility plans to review by outside experts and adopting new storage methods are key to reducing the risk of future failures.Does that mean that any mine can be safe? Payal Sampat of Earthworks, a nonprofit, says no. Sampat serves on the steering committee of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance. IRMA grew from the belief that mining can be done better, and it’s developing criteria to certify environmentally and socially responsible mines. But, Sampat says, “any conversation about how mining can be done more responsibly would have to start with the premise that there are some places that are too precious to mine.”She thinks Pebble is one of them.Pebble does have its supporters, including Graedel. The US is currently a net importer of the minerals that would be mined at Pebble, he says. If we choose not to develop it, he says, “then I think that means we are saying that we would like those sorts of mines to be developed somewhere else, probably where the controls would be less stringent than they would be if a mine were developed in the US.” Graedel would like to see the mine opened, but with the strongest possible protections in place.Seal is less certain. Mines are unique, he says, because “you are kind of stuck with building it wherever you find the ore deposit, and they are very rare, globally speaking.” But that often brings mines in conflict with other valuable resources, like world-class fisheries, he says. “The question is, can we have both?” At Pebble, Seal says, the answer requires carefully analyzing the environmental impacts of the mine’s proposal — and potential alternatives — which won’t be possible until Pebble formalizes its plan. “I don’t know what the right answer is at this point,” Seal says.In 2014 a dam burst at the Mount Polley mine in British Columbia, releasing millions of tons of water contaminated by mine tailings into Polley Lake.Speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Resource Development Council for Alaska last month, Pebble CEO Tom Collier announced preliminary plans for what he said would be a smaller, safer mine. Collier said that the company had made numerous changes in response to concerns, including abandoning the use of cyanide to recover a portion of the gold and building a sturdier tailings dam.Collier also announced that the mine would scale back dramatically, targeting just a fraction of the deposit. The new plan calls for a 5.4-square-mile footprint, down from an estimated 13 square miles, and requires just one of three proposed tailings facilities, limiting its impact to a single tributary of one of nine major rivers that drain into Bristol Bay. (The company has decided not to pursue dry stacking, because it would increase the mine’s footprint, according to a spokesperson.)But the mine’s opponents remain unconvinced. According to the EPA’s 2014 assessment, which formed the basis for its restrictions, even a small mine would have significant and irreversible impacts on wetlands, rivers, and fish, says Heimer of the NRDC. And she suspects that the new plan is just a foot in the door—a first step toward exploiting the larger potential of the deposit, which Pebble’s backers continue to tout to investors.Any day now, the EPA will announce whether or not it will lift its restrictions. Pebble will have 30 months to submit an application for a permit and begin seeking regulatory approval—but the fight won’t be over. Alaska voters are pushing a ballot initiative that would require the state department of fish and game to grant permits for any project that could affect salmon habitat. And the mine has amassed many high-profile critics over the years. Dozens of jewelers — including Tiffany and Co. — have signed a pledge not to buy gold from Pebble.Front and center are the voices of Native Alaskans, who — like many indigenous people living on resource-rich land — have the most at stake. Hurley says she understands the need to mine. But there has to be a limit to the sacrifice, she says: “If this place is not worth saving, what is?”Follow Julia Rosen on Twitter.",
"The Newhalen River is one of numerous waterways that would be affected by the proposed Pebble Mine.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials on Friday put on hold plans for a massive open-pit copper mine in Alaska, invoking Clean Water Act rules. (Related: "Alaska's Clash Over Salmon and Gold Goes National.")Requested by EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, the delay aims "to protect the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska," the agency said in a statement.Such a Clean Water Act hold on mining, invoked only 13 times previously by the agency, means the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cannot approve a permit for the proposed Pebble Mine, which the agency says would foul streams feeding into the bay, the fishery for half the world's wild salmon."Extensive scientific study has given us ample reason to believe that the Pebble Mine would likely have significant and irreversible negative impacts on the Bristol Bay watershed and its abundant salmon fisheries," McCarthy said.Unspoiled BayBristol Bay is located about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, home to the world's largest population of wild salmon. (See pictures of Pacific salmon in National Geographic magazine.)In the upper streams of their spawning grounds, near Iliamna Lake (map), are ore deposits containing about 80 billion pounds (36 billion kilograms) of copper and 110 million ounces (3 million kilograms) of gold where the mine would be located.Tom Collier, the head of the Pebble Limited Partnership—a combination of Northern Dynasty Minerals, of British Columbia, and Anglo American, an international conglomerate headquartered in London—released a statement on the Friday decision, saying "The EPA's actions today are an unprecedented federal action and reflect a major overreach onto an asset of the State of Alaska.""The steps taken by the EPA to date have gone well outside of its normal practice, have been biased throughout, and have been unduly influenced by environmental advocacy organizations," Collier added, in the statement.Proposed MineThe proposed mine would include a pit up to 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) wide and 1,700 feet (520 meters) deep, mines, a mill, and tailings ponds. The Partnership had promised that serious environmental effects would not result from the mine.In the January assessment, however, the EPA had concluded it "would likely cause irreversible destruction of streams that support salmon and other important fish species, as well as extensive areas of wetlands, ponds and lakes."Several Native American tribes had requested the EPA halt permits for the mine, warning of danger to the bay."This is one of the few places left on Earth where nature works as it should, and it's a breadbasket for the world, supplying literally hundreds of thousands of people with wild salmon," said Chris Wood, head of the Trout Unlimited sportsman's organization."If the EPA follows the science and follows through on this, it will rank as one of the most significant conservation achievements of the past 50 years," Wood said in a statement.Clean Water Act regulations mean the decision kicks off a review process, conducted in consultation with the Corps of Engineers, aimed at eventually restricting mining activities that might impair the water quality of Bristol Bay.Follow Dan Vergano on Twitter.",
"The proposed Rosemont copper mine site, pictured, in Arizona's Santa Rita Mountains, would include a pit a mile wide and 2,900 feet deep—and thousands of acres of waste rock piled several hundred feet high.Tucson, ArizonaI’m perched on a ridge in the northern Santa Rita mountains, nearly 30 miles southeast of downtown Tucson. Rounded grassy hills speckled with mesquite rise to oak woodlands and rugged limestone peaks, and I can see for many miles in all directions.The landscape is beautiful, but what’s most special doesn’t immediately announce itself. I am, for example, walking in the footsteps of the country's rarest wild cats. In the gulch just to my southwest, a jaguar roamed during his three-year stay in the range, and an ocelot was recently spotted bounding through this spot.To the east, miles in the distance, lays a broad valley, and within it a streak of dark green—the willows and cottonwoods of Cienega Creek, which flows all year. This network of waters, at Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, provides a home to scarce animals including the Gila topminnow, a sparkly-silver, inch-long fish, and Gila chub, which are larger and more rotund. Yellow-billed cuckoos also roost here. These species, all endangered or threatened, thrive in this precious bit of desert water.Above the valley loom the distant Whetstone mountains—where, until as recently as the 1870s, Apache warriors hid out between raids on ranches in the Cienega Valley; that era of bloodshed ended only when Geronimo and his renegades finally surrendered in 1886, forced onto reservations.Skirmishes over the land, and way of life, persist. In this landscape, competing factions wage an escalating war over the proposed Rosemont copper mine. About a mile to the northeast, a Canadian mining company called Hudbay Minerals plans to dig a large open pit for extracting copper. Like some other big mines, this project has picked up momentum since Donald Trump was elected president. In March, the Army Corps of Engineers approved Rosemont’s crucial Clean Water Act permit, after initially recommending its denial more than two years prior. The project is “shovel-ready,” Hudbay says—but several ongoing lawsuits may stand in the way, with a cadre of environmentalists, local leaders, and indigenous people in opposition.I’m exploring the Rosemont region with biologist Chris Bugbee, who captures wild cat photos with trail cameras. Wearing cargo pants and a T-shirt, Bugbee talks with his mouth nearly closed like he’s trying to keep out flies. He exudes a deep calm peculiar to people who spend time in nature, but he speaks with soft urgency. He clearly loves animals, including the former resident jaguar—locally known as El Jefe—and his Belgian malinois, Mayke, who’s running about intently smelling the earth. The dog was trained to sniff out the scat of jaguars. Bugbee marvels that these felines’ closest living relatives are lions and leopards.“You don’t have to go to Africa to see a big cat,” says Bugbee, who kept tabs on El Jefe during much of the jaguar’s stay in this range, from 2012 to 2015.Puzzling over the land, I’m reminded of a quote by the writer Edward Abbey, famously poignant and prickly, who said that the desert has no heart—no center, no main thing to behold. “It presents a riddle which has no answer,” he wrote in Desert Solitaire. As somebody who loves the desert, like Abbey, I feel I know what he means, without really understanding. The way I appreciate the landscape without comprehending all of it.That being said, this region does have a heart of sorts: the Cienega Aquifer, below us, where water has collected for millennia. It flows through dozens of springs and into Cienega Creek, supporting a rich abundance of wildlife like deer and javelina, which attract the aforementioned jaguars and ocelots, as well as mountain lions and bobcats. It’s one of only two mountain ranges in the United States where four wild cat species have been spotted recently.The curved spine of the Santa Ritas moves south from here, connecting with the Patagonia Mountains and Mexican ranges south of that, forming a continuous rise of highlands. This connectivity allows mammals like jaguars—which have a breeding population in northwest Mexico—and birds like elegant trogons to trek up from Central America. Many tropical species are thus found in southeastern Arizona and nowhere else in the U.S. This specific spot in the northern Santa Ritas also provides wildlife corridors to the Empire Mountains, Whetstones, and Rincons to the east and north.Perhaps even Abbey might say this area has soul, and many agree: The Tohono O’odham, Pascua Yaqui, and Hopi tribes consider this land sacred. Here they honor their ancestors, some of whom are buried in the area, and gather medicinal plants.But a battle for the land is on.A couple miles to the northeast, Hudbay plans to dig a conical pit in the Earth measuring a mile wide and up to 2,900 feet deep—deep enough to fit two Empire State Buildings, one atop the other. The plan entails blasting out and excavating 660 million tons of ore containing copper, and molybdenum, and dumping 1.2 billion tons of waste rock over more than 1,460 acres—nearly twice the size of Central Park—in a heap several hundred feet tall. In all, the mine would take up 4,000 acres of public land, administered by the Forest Service, and its borders would stretch within hurling distance from where I stand.These tailings would cover miles of streams that lead into Davison Canyon, to the northeast. Runoff from the mine would run down the canyon, which eventually joins with Cienega Creek to flow into Pantano wash—a seasonal stream I’ve explored since childhood—that cuts straight through Tucson.After excavation, the ore would be crushed and washed with water and reagents to concentrate the copper and molybdenum. Next it would be trucked out to a smelter, likely in another country. Trucks would haul an estimated 50 daily shipments of copper concentrate down the adjacent two-lane highway, scenic state route 83.Much of the water for this process would be pumped from another aquifer, to the west of the Santa Ritas. Starting near the town of Sahuarita, Hudbay would build a pipeline to stretch over the mountains, along with eight miles of access roads, lights, and electrical lines.To operate, the mine would use around 5 million gallons of water per day, and somewhere around 5,000 acre-feet of water per year, equivalent to the water usage of 25,000 Tucson residents, says Thomas Meixner, a hydrology professor at the University of Arizona and chair of the Cienega Watershed Partnership, a non-partisan non-profit that seeks to conserve the area’s resources and landscapes.The pit would puncture the aquifer and drain water into it, creating a pit lake (reversing the normal flow from the aquifer to springs and creeks.) But the lake wouldn't remain static: It would evaporate water quickly, at a rate up to 240 gallons per minute, according to the U.S. Forest Service’s final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the mine. "That's a lot of water," Meixner says—about as much as 3,000 people in the area use daily.After the life of the mine, estimated at 19 years, the pit lake would form, enlarge, and keep evaporating groundwater in perpetuity. “In the human time frame, it’s forever,” says Julia Fonseca, environmental planning manager with Pima County.The lake would eventually grow to a surface area of 213 acres (three-times the size of the Superdome), containing about as much water as Tucson uses each year. But continual evaporation and refill would concentrate metals and other chemicals. Years in the future this would create a toxic environment for many animals, exceeding chronic exposure standards for cadmium, copper, zinc, and selenium, the EIS notes.Tests are conducted near the site of the planned Rosemont copper mine in the Santa Rita Mountains.The Cienega Aquifer flows into the Tucson basin underground and above, through the Pantano wash, contributing to the city’s groundwater and drinking water—and provides as much as 20 percent of its natural annual recharge. Rosemont’s evaporative pit lake would reduce this flow. That could pinch Tucson, which currently gets its water from the Colorado River, though that resource is politically fraught and unstable. Mine runoff would impact water quality downstream, although models differ as to how much, Meixner says.The pit lake would lower the area’s water table, though it’s unknown to what degree and how quickly. The area remains geologically complex, struck through with various faults and rock formations that aren’t completely understood. But a lower water table could cause some springs and creeks to dry, rare trees and plants to die, and wildlife that depend on them to move or perish.The Bureau of Land Management, which is in charge of the 42,000-acre Las Cienegas National Conservation Area east of the mine site, has repeatedly warned the Forest Service that Rosemont would likely cause parts of the area to go dry part of the year. The mine represents “a clear and present threat” to the area’s waters, the bureau has written.Even a few dry days in Cienega Creek could be disastrous for wildlife like the topminnow. “This is really the only watershed where they are found in great numbers,” Fonseca says.Ditto for the Chiricahua leopard frog. The population at Las Cienegas seems to have a tolerance to chytrid, the fungus that is devastating amphibians worldwide, says Randy Serraglio, a conservation advocate for the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity.Pima County wanted Hudbay to fill in the pit, says the administrator, Chuck Huckelberry, but the mine wouldn’t comply. But that’s because backfilling would “cause more environmental degradation and safety concerns than leaving the pit open,” says Hudbay director of corporate communications Scott Brubacher. According to the final EIS, it would also require 16 years of around-the-clock work, and cost as much as $1 billion. A partial fill would take about three years, and cost up to $112 million.Thanks to the 1872 General Mining Act, it’s easy and cheap to make mineral claims on federal property, and companies pay no royalities for the precious metals they dig up. The land containing the bulk of the Rosemont ore body (and its billions of dollars’ worth of copper) was bought from the government for $5 an acre—about the same rate it would’ve cost when the act was first signed, when Apaches and cowboys were still shooting each other in the Cienega valley.Hudbay owns the rights to Rosemont’s copper because in 2014 it acquired Augusta Resources, a smaller company that proposed building a mine more than a decade ago. Hudbay says that constructing the $1.9 billion mine over three years would employ 2,500 people. During its planned 19-year life, it would provide jobs for an average of about 500 people, Brubacher says, paying wages twice the median in Pima County. It would inject billions into the local economy, he adds.The mine is supported by Republican governor Doug Ducey, and the mining industry remains powerful in Arizona, which produces more copper than any other state. (There’s a copper star on Arizona’s flag for a reason.) Rosemont would be one of the biggest in the U.S., where there are currently 24 copper mines. Though none of these mines have come online since 2014, two are planned to begin construction later this year: One in Nevada, and another, the Gunnison mine, about 45 miles to the northeast near the Dragoon Mountains—where another Apache chief, Cochise, surrendered to the U.S. Army nearly 150 years ago.The natural beauty and relatively pristine landscapes of the Santa Ritas are a major draw for locals, tourists, birders, and hikers. Elephant Head is one such attraction, situated a little over 10 miles southwest of the proposed mine site, and not far from Madera Canyon, one of the country's best birding sites.The leadership of Pima County strongly opposes Rosemont, as do the two members of Congress whose districts the site straddles, Raúl Grijalva and Ann Kirkpatrick. Many in the area take issue with a foreign company digging up American resources, using scarce desert water, and leaving behind a mess, Serraglio says.The mine would, of course, drastically change the landscape. What is now a series of green hills would become a pit lake and a vast mound of waste rock. Besides the impacts on animals and water, it would also produce near-constant noise and light while the mine operates, in an area famous for nights both quiet (minus the howling of coyotes and the hooting of owls) and dark, which makes it a prime spot for astronomy.Pima County commissioned research showing that Rosemont could reduce tourism enough to eclipse the mine’s local economic benefit, Huckelberry says.In July 2016 it seemed like the winds had shifted against Hudbay, when the Army Corps of Engineers’ regional office in Los Angeles recommended denying the mine’s crucial 404 permit. This permitting process, which is overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency, is meant to make large projects like mines comply with the Clean Water Act. The EPA has multiple times—including in a widely circulated 2013 letter—urged the Corps to deny the permit out of concern it’d violate this act.“The mine will irreparably undo decades of public efforts to protect drinking water supplies, biological resources and sensitive aquatic ecosystems within the Cienega Creek watershed,” the EPA wrote in another such letter to the Corps, in November 2017.Because Ducey (and his predecessor) objected to the LA office’s ruling, the case was forwarded to the regional headquarters in San Francisco to be finalized, a process that was supposed to take six months. But in November 2016, Donald Trump was elected president. In April 2017, Trump nominated David Bernhardt to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Bernhardt, now Interior secretary, was a lobbyist for Hudbay from 2011 through 2015, and a consultant to them for more than a year thereafter.The final decision was delayed for two years. Finally, in early March 2019, the Army Corps approved the mine’s 404 Clean Water Act permit. The agency didn’t explain why they reversed their decision, and didn’t respond to request for comment.The only major necessary permit remaining, from the Forest Service, came through weeks later, in late March. The service administers the public land where much of the mine would sit.Several groups have sued both agencies, arguing that they are violating a suite of federal laws.One lawsuit, against the Forest Service, combines legal cases by disparate organizations including environmentalists and Native Americans, who say that the mining will violate their sacred land and destroy cultural artifacts like tomb sites. The environmental faction, which includes the Center for Biological Diversity, says the Forest Service has violated the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and other laws. Another recent suit, just filed in late March, argues that the Army Corps approval violates the Clean Water Act.The Forest Service’s approval rests largely on the notion that they are obligated to allow mining and dumping of waste rock on federal land, because of how they interpret the 1872 Mining Act, says Roger Flynn, an environmental lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Colorado School of Law, and founder of a public interest law firm called the Western Mining Action Project.“They assume that Rosemont has the rights to permanent dumping without any evidence that those rights exist,” Flynn says.According to the act, those who wish to develop mineral claims have the right to occupy land upon which valuable minerals are found. Hudbay hasn’t shown that the large tracts of federal land where they plan to dump waste rock contain such deposits, Flynn says.U.S. District Judge James Soto essentially agreed with that logic in a groundbreaking ruling on July 31, writing that the Forest Service inappropriately approved the mine, by failing to determine whether or not Hudbay had valid mining claims on the 2,447 acres of public land where it proposed dumping tailings and mine waste. That decision has, for now, halted further work and construction on the mine—though Hudbay said in a statement that it plans to appeal—and could have wider implications for how the Forest Service deals with mining claims elsewhere. Hudbay had lined up contractors for construction and had hoped to begin work in August.In addition, the Forest Service has argued that it is only bound to consider impacts on land that it is responsible for, and not adjoining areas or their water, he adds. Both of these arguments are critical legal errors, Flynn says, that run afoul of federal public land laws, such as the 1897 Organic Act. Brubacher disagrees, emphasizing that the mine has been in review and permitting procedures for more than a decade and conforms to all applicable laws.Like the Forest Service, the Army Corps is only considering an inappropriately narrow set of impacts from the mine, Flynn says, examining only the impacts from the initial filling of nearby washes with earth. But the agency didn’t consider the effects of the mine’s construction and operation on the surrounding water table, water quality, wildlife, or cultural resources like burial sites, he says. The Corps, which rarely denies mining permits, got it right the first time. And its “flip-flop” could be precedent-setting, he adds.“This is a new and very troubling position from the Corps,” Flynn says.The Forest Service didn’t respond to questions about these points, instead referring to the agency’s voluminous EIS and record of decision. But the service added, through a spokesperson, that the agency “continues to be committed to an open and transparent process.”A similar change in legal interpretation may be at play with the massive Pebble Mine in Alaska, which looked likely to be denied but may be on again, and the PolyMet project in Minnesota.Serraglio and others vow to fight it to the end; while Hudbay claims that it will continue consulting with all the necessary authorities and local groups."Economic opportunity and environmental responsibility can co-exist," Brubacher says. He cites as an example Coleman's coralroot, a unique orchid that grows beneath oak trees. "As a result of studies sponsored by Rosemont, the known distribution of the species has been proven to expand now to over 22 locations." Mining activities might impact five of these populations, and wipe out two of them, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.Rosemont plans to mitigate the impact of the mine by remediation work in places including Sonoita Creek, miles to the south, in a different watershed. Many scientists and environmental groups have criticized these plans as inadequate. The Nature Conservancy, which owns a high-quality preserve downstream, has objected to the plans because the activity—which includes moving a stream a few hundred feet away from a highway—could flood their property in sediment. Work that went into mitigation plans was flawed as well, according to two biologists once employed by Westland Resources, a contractor hired by Hudbay to provide data on some of the mine sites’ plants and animals.Jan Fox, a plant biologist who worked for the company for more than eight years, says that some rare and important species were present in the Rosemont site but not recorded. This includes a small flowering vine called Thurber’s morning glory. She and others found this plant—which is listed as critically imperiled by the Coronado National Forest—within the Rosemont site, but it was not reported, she says.Moreover, workers spent many hours looking for plants and animals that would be unlikely to be found, according to another biologist who worked for the company, Aaron Chambers. For example, his team canvassed the site for a rare butterfly called the cestus skipper (Atrytonopsis cestus), which reproduces on a plant that is not present in the Santa Ritas.This gives the appearance of due diligence, while actually being a ruse, Chambers says. “Even a partially competent biologist would know that the habitat was poor [for it.] This was all greenwashing.”David Cerasale, Westland’s director of natural resources, disputes these claims, saying that the rare plants Fox mentioned were “made note of” in reports prepared for Hudbay. The company didn’t decide which plants to look for—rather they were following instructions from the Forest Service, which created the list of 11 sensitive species, he adds. The Forest Service didn’t respond to questions about the list or what was reported.Cerasale also said the company’s surveys turned up important new findings, such as populations of threatened Chiricahua leopard frogs and yellow-billed cuckoos within the perimeter of the Rosemont site.After surveying on the ridge, Bugbee and I drive through the planned mine site, past Forest Service signs saying “land of many uses,” and bullet-pecked Hudbay placards saying “no photos allowed.” Test-drilling sites have scarred the earth red, and at a guard shack that blocks a route through public land, a Hudbay security guard exits and says there’s nothing to see on the road beyond.“They’re not doing anything yet.”But with construction planned to begin in June, the opposition has stiffened—and there is no end in sight to the pending lawsuits. “There has been passionate feeling on both sides of the question,” Brubacher says.Serraglio agrees. “This mine will happen over my dead body,” he says. “I can’t let myself believe they’re going to be able to do this.”",
"A young visitor enjoys the beach at sunset at Indiana Dunes National Park. Within a hundred miles of about 8 million people, Indiana Dunes is one of the most accessible parks for urbanites.A sandy crescent of Lake Michigan shoreline, Indiana Dunes National Park is a 15,000-acre stretch that feels a world apart from the steel mills that loom on its horizon. Less than an hour from the third-largest city in the United States, the park presents an easy escape into nature—and not just for Chicagoans. Last year, some 3.6 million people visited Indiana Dunes and its adjoining state park; a combined figure that would place this landscape among the top seven most visited national parks in the country.This popularity is partly due to Indiana Dunes’ recent redesignation: In February 2019, it became the nation’s 61st national park. Park staff were already expecting a record-breaking 2020. And then the coronavirus pandemic hit, unexpectedly bringing in even greater crowds.With Chicago’s closure of its beaches in late March (followed by nearby Michigan City’s coastal closure in July), the Indiana Dunes staff has been braced for visitation to continue breaking records. The crisis they face: How to enforce social distancing at a national park that draws Yellowstone-size crowds—but with only one percent of Yellowstone’s acreage?“National park attendance rose 21 percent in 2019,” says Lorelei Weimer, executive director of Indiana Dunes Tourism, which runs the visitor center shared with the National Park Service. The national designation immediately attracted a new demographic, she says. “Before then, people came for the beaches. Now, they’re die-hard national park visitors.”Chicago’s skyline, just over 50 miles away, stretches above Lake Michigan. The park’s horizon also includes the Port of Indiana—a looming reminder that the dunes barely escaped industrialization.Weimer reports that the visitor center usually sees just under 100,000 walk-ins a year; in 2019, that number increased 83 percent, thanks to tourists from a record 64 different countries. “We had no way of being prepared,” Weimer says. “The real heroes are our staff and rangers. There were almost 2,000 visitors a day for Fourth of July weekend [in 2019].”Now, largely thanks to COVID-19, every day at Indiana Dunes National Park is like the Fourth of July.Approach the rangers in the COVID-distanced tent outside the visitor center—they’ll be there through Labor Day—and you’ll hear a chorus of comments on “holiday crowds.” Visitors are flocking to the Dunes in record numbers to combat cabin fever, despite summer’s aching heat and high humidity. Even mid-week, parking lots buzz by 10 a.m.“Most of our beach sites fill up early in the morning and stay full for the entire day, every day,” explains Shelby Hoyert, park ranger and life-long area resident. “Before COVID, we would only fill up on weekends.” Even the Cowles Bog Trail—a previous “hidden gem” of the park, Hoyert notes—has become a major destination.(Related: Summer has brought hectic crowds to U.S. national parks.)Fortunately, the staff isn’t entirely in new territory.“2019 turned into a very exciting and wonderful visitor season,” writes Park Superintendent Paul Labovitz in an email. “It jazzed up our staff [to have] new visitors from all over.” Thanks to last year’s boom, Labovitz says, staff can better predict visitor needs and questions during the coronavirus boom—a skill needed now more than ever.Being a tiny, fee-free national park within a few hours of some 8 million urbanites, Indiana Dunes seems primed to become a pandemic petri dish akin to Florida’s swarming spring-break beaches. Even without famous lodges, cramped shuttles, or hands-on museums, crowds still need to be managed.(Related: Is it safe—or ethical—to go hiking during the pandemic?)Indiana Dunes’s staff hasn’t increased. Instead, rangers and officers from various other parks and police departments supplement park law enforcement. With public programming canceled, these staff now patrol beach parking lots to promote social distancing—as much as they can.“Folks seem to think just being outside gives them a chance to ignore social distancing,” writes Labovitz. “Smarter folks who are concerned can find a secluded spot just by walking east and west of the crowds.” The popular state park—home to even higher dunes—is only accessible by driving through the national park, which often takes up to an hour.“We can only control our own behavior,” Labovitz says. “Our staff works hard at providing a place for visitors to experience this national park, and we will continue to place our health and safety as the highest priority.”Following the Chicago beach closures, park rangers and visitor center staff are urging beachgoers to stick to the West Beach area, which has more parking than the entire east section of the park combined. Visitors seem to be listening, Hoyert says: attendance there has doubled compared to 2019.(Related: Here’s why some people can’t resist crowds despite the pandemic.)But listening seems to be selective. Mask recommendations and social distancing guidelines are going largely unheeded, especially on the sand. This reality—combined with local mandates and increased visitation projections—puts the park in a unique position. If area beaches are shuttering in the interest of public health, should Indiana Dunes follow suit?  “Closure is an option,” Labovitz says, though more stringent protocols would likely be a sooner step. “Stay tuned.”  For now, throngs of visitors will descend upon this tiny swath of Lake Michigan, likely unaware that experiencing it now may mean losing it later—a truth hardly unique to this brand-new national park.",
"The frozen expanse of Lake Michigan crowds against shoreline dunes at Indiana Dunes National Park.After 53 years as Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, the southern shores of Lake Michigan were renamed the United States’ 61st national park. Fifteen miles of beaches give way not only to impressive sand dunes and blowouts, but marshes, wetlands, groves of black oak savanna and maple sugar trees, and fields of wildflowers that come and go with the seasons.Don’t let its small size and recently upgraded designation deceive you: Indiana Dunes National Park’s biodiversity ranks seventh out of all 400-plus National Park Service units—and the nation’s newest park sees nearly as many visitors a year as Mount Rushmore. Here’s how to make the most of your trip.Indiana Dunes National Park sandwiches Indiana Dunes State Park, where you can find the area’s three tallest dunes: Mount Tom (192 ft), Mount Holden (184 ft), and Mount Jackson (176 ft). Trails 8, 9, and 10 are arguably the definitive trails of the area, showcasing dune blowouts, “tree graveyards,” and forests of white pine rising above Lake Michigan. Trail 8 is the shortest route to summit each dune, otherwise known as the Three Dune Challenge.The national park, however, lays claim to the most dynamic dune: Mount Baldy. It’s slowly eroding, or “starving,” moving roughly four feet a year. The trail to its top is regularly closed; if it’s open during your visit, go. Similarly impressive is the nearby Dune Ridge Trail—a route that takes you up above Kemil Beach and the Great Marsh—and the West Beach 3-Loop Trail, a 3.4-mile loop that displays all stages of dune development, with views that often extend to the Chicago skyline.Most trails can be tackled on snowshoes or cross-country skis come winter, and they’re usually well-marked with wildlife tracks after any recent snowfall. Bikers should note the Calumet Bike Trail, running all the way from Mineral Springs Road to Mount Baldy.The majority of the park’s annual visitors come for the swimming and beachcombing. Lake View, Kemil, Dunbar, and Porter beaches are all swim at your own risk, with smaller parking lots that fill up quickly in summer. West Beach (the only lot that charges, at $6 per car) has showers and lifeguards. On any beach day, consider scoping out the Portage Lakefront & Riverwalk, an impressive, eco-friendly pavilion with basic amenities and water access.For paddlers, there’s also the 35-mile Lake Michigan Water Trail. Bring your own kayak, hug the water’s edge, and camp at designated sites as you progress along the lake. For greater nature immersion, consider the Little Calumet River or Burns Waterway.Over a thousand native plant species and 370 bird species make this one of the most biodiverse swaths of land in the U.S. The Great Marsh Trail and the Heron Rookery are excellent places to birdwatch for tree swallows, rusty blackbirds, kingfishers, egrets, and green herons.In the warmer months, check out the 4.7-mile Cowles Bog Trail—plant diversity is so outstanding here the area was designated a National Natural Landmark. The Tolleston Dunes Trail, another good option, winds 2.9 miles from oak savanna and wetlands into prickly pear cactus country.The Port of Indiana looms on the horizon, a reminder that this area barely escaped industrialization. In fact, the once-largest dune, the Hoosier Slide, was carried off in boxcars as early as 1916. Activists fought to preserve the dunes; their eventual success resulted in today’s landscape, a study in contrasts.Accessible by a 3.7-mile trail system, the Chellburg Farmhouse and Bailly Homestead provide vestiges of this pre-industrial past. Here, your path follows the Little Calumet River, skirting these two pioneer remnants (and a crumbling cemetery), passing through a forested ravine, and emptying into the oak savanna.One of the most photographed views in Zion National Park, and perhaps all of the parks, is the view of the Watchman from the Canyon Junction Bridge. Although it has been shot endless times, and you are sure to be shoulder to shoulder with other photographers during sunset, it is still something everyone must do when visiting the park. My favorite spot is right at the center of the bridge where the river leads the eye to the Watchman in the background.Just east of the border between the national and state parks, you’ll find something closer to modernity: five homes from the 1933 Century of Progress World’s Fair. You can spot them on a beach stroll or cruising down Lakefront Drive—tours are held annually, usually in fall. The Florida Tropical House, in its bubblegum-pink grandeur, is hard to miss.In the warmer months, come early. It’s not uncommon for cars to line up outside the entrance gates before they’re even open. Most parking lots fill by mid-morning, though West Beach rarely fills to its 600-space capacity.Crowds dwindle with temperatures, and winter can mean you’re alone with the birds and the beavers. Watch the ice shelf float in and out as you stroll along an empty beach. For an off-season bonus, the state park regularly lifts its $12 entrance fee.The 1.1-mile Trail 7 in the state park division—next to the Nature Center—is the most direct route combining dune hikes with beach access. Time permitting, it crosses the longer Trail 8, which takes you to the top of the park’s tallest dunes.Spend the next few hours inland and explore the Paul H. Douglas Trail, the Little Calumet River Trail, or the Great Marsh Trail, watching for wildlife and scouting for rare plants, like the gaywing or the carnivorous purple pitcher plant. Catch sunset at a larger beach, like Kemil, Dunbar, or West, and get your feet wet in the giant puddle known as Lake Michigan, left behind by the long-gone Wisconsin Glacier.",
"A state project that became a masterpiece, Mount Rushmore was conceived in the early 1920s by state historian Doane Robinson to draw tourists to South Dakota.After hearing about a project to chisel the Confederate leaders on the face of Stone Mountain in Georgia, Robinson wrote the sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, and invited him to the Black Hills.It was Borglum who picked the four presidents and the granite expanse, and in 1925, Congress agreed to fund the idea. Borglum and hundreds of workers spent the next 14 years and a million dollars creating the monument.Today, nearly three million visitors come each year to ogle the massive busts, each as tall as a six-story building.This piece, written by National Geographic Traveler contributing editor Andrew Nelson, appeared in the magazine’s June/July 2013 issue.

"The White Mountains, in New Hampshire, attract thousands of tourists to the hiking trails and beautiful views.Summer is officially here, and that means millions of people nervous about flying in the age of coronavirus will likely hit the road in a car. As America’s national parks and forests start to reopen, many vacationers are looking to stretch their legs out on the trails, from Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve to Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park.In ordinary times, a surge of hikers would be a boon for the picturesque gateway towns near these popular outdoor destinations. But during a pandemic, locals whose livelihoods are largely built on seasonal tourism are forced to reconsider the cost-benefit ratio of welcoming hordes of out-of-towners searching for that perfect waterfall picture or alpine vista.That’s especially true in native lands, like Navajo Nation, situated near popular recreation areas like Grand Canyon National Park. With 5,250 cases to date, Navajo Nation has one of America’s highest coronavirus infection rates, making it particularly vulnerable to an influx of tourists.Some backcountry communities have avoided disaster. The small and often underfunded regional hospitals that serve these areas haven’t been pushed to their breaking points yet. And the grocery stores are fully stocked, saved for the time being from visitors clearing shelves and leaving residents with a shortage of supplies.Part of the low infection numbers may be due to these towns’ geographic isolation offering something of a social distancing buffer. But that could change as summer gets underway, bringing with it urbanites seeking to escape their COVID-stricken environs.North Conway, New Hampshire, is a prime example of a backcountry recreation village. It rests in the shadow of White Mountain National Forest, a half hour’s drive from popular trailheads. The central strip offers brewpubs, burger joints, and hotels with names like Eastern Slope Inn and the Swiss Chalets Village Inn. From a grassy rest stop on the north edge of town, you can gaze out at the pinnacle of Mount Washington.It's an ideal place to hang your hat—or trekking poles—after a lung-buster of a hike. As such, seasonal tourism is a pillar of North Conway’s economy. In some years, the year-round population of 2,000 swells with an additional 17,000 visitors flocking here from nearby Boston and New York City on weekends alone to put their feet up in the rental cottages and second homes nestled in the hills and hollows.Masked hikers share a narrow path at Eaton Canyon Natural Area and Nature Center, in Pasadena, California. COVID-19 has changed how people enjoy outdoor activities, like hiking.To date, Carroll County, which includes North Conway, has confirmed 37 COVID-19 cases. The actual number could be higher, given the shortage of test kits in New Hampshire and the role that asymptomatic carriers might be playing in spreading the virus. The “outbreak” here isn’t remotely comparable to what’s happening in large American cities and suburbs. But locals are preparing for the worst as temperatures rise and city folk get tired of baking bread.(Related: Read about crowds slamming national parks, as summer gets underway.)“We’ve been a little worried about an influx of people from out of state because in this particular instance, the prevalence [of COVID-19 infections] has been much greater outside of our border,” says Dr. Antonia Altomare, an infectious disease and international health specialist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,in Lebanon, New Hampshire, about two hours by car from North Conway. “We just started antibody testing in New Hampshire and we’re finding that less than 4 percent of our population has detectable antibodies. What that means for immunity is still unclear.”Rick and Celia Wilcox are preparing for the crowds. The owners of International Mountain Equipment in North Conway are allowing 10 to 15 customers at a time into their 10,000-square-foot climbing school and outdoor gear shop, with its labyrinthine consignment basement. They’ve stocked up on disinfectant and will be asking customers to wear masks and keep six feet of distance at all times.Even with the precautions, Rick Wilcox is optimistic that visitors from coronavirus-stricken cities will be especially mindful about social distancing best practices. But he acknowledges that this year, summer tourism is a controversial topic with some business owners, given that about 75 percent of their customers come from outside the state. “We’re looking for those folks to come up here, recreate, and do it safely,” he says. “But folks who are scared of people coming from the city and bringing the virus north would probably say, ‘Well, they’re gonna go into your store and you’re gonna get sick.’”Going on a hiking getaway while minimizing exposure to backcountry communities is trickier than it may seem. Sticking with day trips, social distancing on trails, and avoiding restaurants is easy. But how do you handle gas station fill-ups in rural towns? What if you find yourself in need of a toilet, or a mechanic, if your car breaks down? Worse, what happens if you twist an ankle or succumb to heat exhaustion in the wild?America’s search-and-rescue (SAR) providers have struggled to stay solvent as millions of new hikers have flocked to parks and public lands in recent years, straining the resources of the volunteer-dependent organization. The pandemic has added complications.“This spring, we really had to scramble to get the proper [personal protective equipment (PPE)] that we needed,” says Drew Hildner, a Boulder, Colorado, resident and a medic with Rocky Mountain Rescue, one of the largest SAR providers in the U.S.Unlike large ambulance companies or fire departments, SAR doesn’t have big accounts with medical suppliers because they don’t need them. “Normally, we’re not burning through our equipment and we’d make infrequent orders,” Hildner says. “We ended up crowdsourcing masks and other PPE items.”Even with a new supply of PPE, including N95 masks, secured for now, Hildner notes that the occupational hazards of treating patients during a pandemic could nonetheless impact the scale of SAR operations.“We’re currently on pace to have our third busiest rescue season in our 73-year history,” he says, alluding to the heavy usage the Boulder-area trails have already seen, since the pandemic began. “Because we’re trying to limit exposure, we are very quickly capping our SAR response teams, once we have the minimum number of people required for any given rescue. Most of these rescues require at least 10 to 15 people, and if we end up with a patient who tested positive for COVID-19, those 10 to 15 SAR volunteers would have to be in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. And if that happened twice in a row, then we’d be pretty hard-up for response.”(Related: Here’s how to visit national parks safely as lockdowns lift.)For road-tripping hikers, these questions are mostly ethical. But for rural communities, they may be existential. Back in March, when the pandemic lockdowns began, the town of Moab, Utah (a base camp for Grand Canyon tourists) urged non-essential visitors to stay home, stressing the region’s limited healthcare infrastructure.Island communities in MidCoast Maine put out a similar notice to seasonal visitors. “Every additional person who comes here is just putting one more stressor on what we have for resources, whether it be the grocery store, the gas station, our EMS system,” said Marc Candage, the fire chief and emergency management director of Vinalhaven (home of Maine’s largest lobstering fleet), in an interview with Maine’s local NBC News affiliate.These requests to stay home aren’t made lightly. Tourism in America, a trillion dollar industry, has thrived in recent years. The U.S. Travel Association found that in 2019, four out of five domestic trips taken within the U.S. were for leisure. A sustained nosedive of seasonal travel could mean a disproportionately painful economic punch for rural communities that normally attract hikers and other outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ April jobs report found that the coronavirus pandemic has already wiped out more than 7 million leisure and hospitality jobs.These industries are a big deal in outdoor tourism towns. Consider national park “gateway communities” such as West Yellowstone, Montana. A study by Resources magazine found that in West Yellowstone, tourism-related jobs comprise 37 percent of all local jobs. The study also highlighted western towns such as Springdale, Utah (gateway to Zion) and Cortez, Colorado (gateway to Mesa Verde). The takeaway was stark—in each town, tourism jobs accounted for at least 12 percent of the local economy, but usually much more. To date, the federal government hasn’t come up with any plans to bail out these communities.As a result, would-be vacationers face uncertainty and frustratingly differing rules. Vermont and Maine have instructed all visitors to self-quarantine for two weeks upon entering the state. But in towns like North Conway, there’s no blanket directive for out-of-state hikers who are thirsting for hemlock evergreens and krummholz, the gnarled bonsai-like trees that grow at the timberline. Hikers are being urged to wear masks and keep their distance, though small towns don’t have the resources to enforce social distancing measures.(Related: Learn how Jackson, Wyoming, is coping with a pandemic-caused reduction in summer tourism.)All this uncertainty is causing some vacationers to rethink their summer plans. Jonathan Rosenfield, a social worker based in Boston, has put his usual northern New England hiking plans on hold.Instead, he’s begun taking localized “urban hikes” around the weird side streets and forgotten parklets of the city. “I’ve been discovering all sorts of gorgeous dead ends and pretty houses around where I live,” he says. “I much prefer the natural world with no noises from cars, but I like seeing new things.”(Related: Find out how urban foraging can help you travel deeper.)Alison Dunn, a wine industry professional, has taken a similar approach to summer hiking. She’s been scaling the hills in Dorchester, her neighborhood and one of Boston’s most COVID-stricken communities.Dunn had been planning to take part in a fundraising ascent of Mount Washington this summer, for the benefit of the mountaintop weather observatory. But that’s not happening anymore.For Dunn, who grew up in a small town in Georgia, a summer without backcountry hiking is a sacrifice that feels like the right thing to do, especially now. It’s a lesson she learned last year, when she saw firsthand how locals felt at the end of the fall foliage season in the Whites.“You could sense this relief that the deluge of tourists was finally over and people could go back to their towns, and I felt like a fraud,” she recalls thinking back then. “I’m from a small rural town in the countryside, and I want to respect these towns, because I’m a visitor. And yet, here I am. You can see my [Massachusetts] plates in the driveway.”",
"A road leads into Zion National Park in Utah.Gateway Airport: McCarran International, Las VegasThis multiday adventure on remote byways is a journey through the slickrock heart of the American West, linking Utah’s "Mighty Five" national parks—Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Arches, and Canyonlands—with the diverse state parks and nameless vistas of Southern Utah. Each park showcases the iconic landscape of the Colorado Plateau, much of it an ancient Sahara now turned to stone. The surreal tableau of arches, alcoves, hoodoos, and epic canyons is so otherworldly, you may wonder what planet you’re on.A free park shuttle follows the Virgin River, which flows in the shadows of some of the world’s tallest sandstone cliffs, creating a walled sanctuary adorned with hanging gardens and emerald pools. Get out at any of the eight stops and be stunned by the immensity of it all.

Wildflowers burst onto the scene by mid- to late June; the fuchsia Bryce Canyon paintbrush, which only grows below the rim of Bryce Canyon, blooms in May.A tourist hikes a trail through Grand Wash Gorge in Capitol Reef National Park.The Reef is the least known and most remote of Utah’s five national parks and encompasses the hundred-mile-long Waterpocket Fold, a wall-like rift of stone in Earth’s surface that kept out all but the hardiest of pioneers. Those who persevered found an idyllic oasis pocketed amid the Reef’s monumental Capitol-like domes, natural bridges, spires, and slot canyons—and you will too.The Route: Bryce Canyon > UT 63 N > UT 12 E > UT 24 E (116 miles)On the Way: Learn the real meaning of true grit at Escalante Heritage Center. Up the road in Boulder, the Anasazi State Park Museum conjures up life from an earlier culture.Stay: Red River Ranch serves up genteel Western luxury—but with a swagger. Motels in Torrey provide a quicker launch into the park.Eat: Local trout is served up at Rim Rock Restaurant in Torrey.Don’t Miss: The park's 1908 Gifford Homestead for an authentic taste of Mormon pioneer living. Not for the museum-like displays—OK, maybe those too—but for the locally baked mini-apple pies available in the gift shop.Jaw-Dropping Viewpoints: Hike less than 20 minutes to a solitary bench at the end of the Sunset Point Trail for the park’s most elemental panorama—brick red Moenkopi towers, domes of bone white Navajo Sandstone, and the distant Henry Mountains. The green swath of trees lining Sulphur Creek as it joins the Fremont River ties it all together.Tour: The Fruita Rural Historic District provides an idyllic look at pioneer life: a classic barn, the old blacksmith’s shop, Fruita’s first tractor, horse-drawn farming equipment. Walk among the 22 legacy fruit and nut orchards and pick some fruit using fruit-pickers and three-legged ladders, weighing your harvest at one of the self-pay stations.Side Drive: Head to Cathedral Valley to see iconic Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Moon. You’ll need a high-clearance vehicle for the rough spots, which include fording a hubcap-deep river. Call the park for road and river conditions before attempting this 59-mile loop.Oddity: Capitol Reef has evolved its own unique strain of apple, the Capitol Reef Red. You’ll find them in Jackson Orchard.Before You Come: Read Everett Ruess: A Vagabond for Beauty by W.L. Rusho.Park Website: nps.gov/careSeasonal Notes: From March to mid-April, the orchards explode in blossoms, and the mercury hovers at around 60º to 70ºF, ideal for hiking the backcountry as long as spring storms aren’t in the forecast. Summers are quite a bit hotter and at the mercy of occasional monsoons. Come between the second week of June and October to harvest orchard fruit. (Call 435-425-3791 for orchard updates.)A car makes its way on a long stretch of road in Arches National Park.These 120 square miles contain the highest density of stone arches in the world—2,000 and counting. Some are iconic, such as Delicate Arch (the one printed on Utah's license plates). Others shatter records, including pencil-thin Landscape Arch, one of the world's longest freestanding arches. And some you’ll have to search out yourself on trails that lead you deep into a sandstone world dating back 300 million years.The Route: Capitol Reef > UT 24 E > I-70 E > US 191 S (147 miles)On the Way: Learn about the one-armed wonder who first surveyed the Colorado River at the John Wesley Powell River History Museum in Green River. Then have lunch at family-friendly Ray’s Tavern (established 1943), a favorite among river rats.Stay: On a quickening bend of the Colorado, in John Wayne country, Red Cliffs Lodge ($120 to $240) offers views of the riverside and sunsets reflecting off red mesas. For fun, a life-size cutout of the Duke in the movie museum downstairs makes for great selfies.Eat: In Moab, locals choose Love Muffin for breakfast, Milt’s Stop and Eat for lunch, and Moab Brewery for dinner and ale brewed on site. In a hurry? Chase down the bright-yellow food truck Quesadilla Mobilla for quesadillas to go.Don’t Miss: To go to Arches and not see Delicate Arch is like going to the Louvre and not seeing the "Mona Lisa." The march to the arch takes close to an hour, most of it uphill, so bring plenty of water.Jaw-Dropping Viewpoint: The overlook at Park Avenue peers down a ravine walled in by monolithic sandstone formations, some vaguely human in appearance. Look for Queen Nefertiti on the left and Queen Victoria—which actually looks more like "Whistler’s Mother"—on the right.Tour: The safest way to visit Fiery Furnace, a confusing labyrinth of sandstone fins, is on a three-hour tour led by park rangers (offered at least once daily during summer). Maps or GPS are useless, so don’t go it alone unless you’ve been here before. Breadcrumbs—or any other trail markers—aren’t allowed.Side Drive: Get off the pavement and away from the crowds by driving 8.3 miles up Salt Valley Road to the Tower Arch trailhead. Once there, why not hike the 3.4-mile (round-trip) trail to Tower Arch? A series of pinnacles called Marching Men will point you in the right direction.Oddity: In the Fiery Furnace, ask the ranger to point out Canyonlands lomatium (also called Arches biscuitroot), which blooms from February to April. It just might be the only time you’ll ever see it, as most of the world’s supply is only found in the park’s Entrada fins.Before You Come: Read the Edward Abbey classic Desert Solitaire, a memoir about his time as a ranger here.Park Website: www.nps.gov/archSeasonal Notes: Spring can be erratic, with blustery storms punctuating long stretches of warm and settled weather (60º to 70ºF). By April and May, wildflowers speckle the desert floor. The first scorching breaths of summer hit in June. Summer monsoons can bust loose anytime in July and August, bringing with them flash flooding and ephemeral waterfalls and setting off a second bloom of color in September and October.The sun peeks through Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park.This is as wild as it gets. Canyonlands is the largest and most undeveloped of Utah’s national parks, so vast it’s divided into four sections. The rivers—the Colorado and Green Rivers and their tributaries—make up one section. The Maze is rough, remote, and rarely visited. Island in the Sky (I-SKY) floats high above the canyon bottoms, a mesa rimmed with vertiginous vistas. The Needles—from I-SKY more than 110 miles to the south via roads outside the park—offers miles of stupendous hiking. If time’s an issue, stick to I-SKY. If not, head to the Needles as well.The Route to Island in the Sky: Arches > US 191 N > US 313 W (26 miles)The Route to the Needles: Arches > US 191 S > UT 211 W (88 miles)On the Way: When heading to I-SKY, check out progress on the Moab Giants, a soon-to-open dinosaur tracks museum at the junction of U.S. 313 and 191. Heading to the Needles? Stop at Newspaper Rock (along Utah Route 211) to decipher hundreds of petroglyphs incised in stone.Stay: Moab’s many in-town hotels and motels provide the option of early morning starts to either the Needles or I-SKY. Lodging in Monticello, the nearest town to the Needles district, is a more prosaic alternative.Eat: Besides Moab’s burger-and-brew restaurants, there are Thai, Japanese, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within walking distance of each other. Some menu browsing is called for. In Monticello, poke into the Peace Tree Juice Cafe.Jaw-Dropping Viewpoint: Drive to I-SKY’s Grand View Point overlook for seriously epic views of an endless succession of red rock canyons—with nothing human visible—stretching as far as the eye can see. For maximum effect, settle in for the sunset.Tour: Ditch the car and set out on a half-day to multiday Canyonlands adventure in 4x4s that will get you deep into the backcountry.Oddity: Geologists are still debating the origins of I-SKY’s Upheaval Dome, a mysterious crater three miles across that could either be a collapsed salt dome or the result of a 60-million-year-old meteor strike.Before You Come: Dress code is "desert rat casual," so hit up an outdoor outfitter for breathable wide-brim hats, vented shirts, convertible hiking pants and lightweight lugged shoes—and don’t forget the bandanna.Park Website: nps.gov/canySeasonal Notes: This is extreme country with extreme weather, from summer’s torrential downpours and triple-digit temps to winter's snowstorms and biting wind. I-SKY’s higher elevation (averaging 6,100 feet) helps moderate summer’s scorching temps, especially when the sun goes down. Some winter days can be downright balmy. Spring is ideal, however; it's when wildflowers explode in color, wildlife is active, and weather rarely gets in the way of a hike.",
"Built on George Washington's orders, the 1971 Portland Head Light flashes from Cape Elizabeth.Rugged shores, classic coastal towns, and lobster rolls washed down with hoppy local beer. This is Maine’s late-summer perfection—the microseason when the Pine Tree State shines. It’s when the water is warmest, and the wild blueberries are ripest for the picking.Last August, the Maine Sea Grant, along with the state’s tourism bureau and aquaculture industry, launched the Oyster Trail of Maine to promote the burgeoning bivalve scene, which stars the Crassostrea virginica variety. But even if the idea of slurping down an oyster makes you squeamish, following the trail of Maine’s mighty mollusk leads to plenty of memorable spots.Unlike the remote northwestern parts of the state, where unmarked logging roads and vast swaths of impenetrable backcountry reign supreme, in coastal Maine the world actually is your oyster. Motoring along Route 1 from the southern beaches to the mid-coast delivers a hefty dose of vintage oceanside charm.Along the way, smaller roads that beg for a detour dip to the sea. Here old salts haul traps on working waterfronts, and roadside sandwich boards hawk just-caught lobsters. Along with these colorful nautical traditions, you’ll find a forward-thinking spirit. So go ahead, catch the spirit and hit the road.Try Mabel's Lobster Claw Restaurant in Kennebunkport, open since the 1950s.Famous as a favorite seaside retreat for the well-heeled—and the summer playground of former president George H.W. Bush and family—Kennebunkport epitomizes New England nautical charm. Roll up to the Sandy Pines Campground, where 16 safari tents, each decked out in lavish style by a local interior designer, offer a plush but nostalgic outdoor experience. On-site amenities include a classic general store and the “Icicle Tricycle” delivering old-fashioned ice cream bars.Nonesuch Oysters offers a tour of its nursery on the Scarborough River.Ten years ago Abigail Carroll was living in Paris, trading stocks, and dating a French count. Now she spends her days on the Scarborough River, where she runs Nonesuch Oysters. Climb aboard the farm’s skiff for a breezy jaunt to the oyster beds, keeping an eye out for puppy-faced harbor seals along the way. Then peek at baby bivalves in the oyster nursery before tossing back a few Abigail Pearls or Nonesuch Emeralds.Though rocky shores dominate Maine’s coastline, a mile-long swath of sand frames the Inn by the Sea in Cape Elizabeth. Follow the boardwalk through a sanctuary planted with native vegetation to lovely Crescent Beach. The six-acre oasis is part of an initiative to create a safe haven for vulnerable New England cottontail rabbits. The inn also works with the Animal Refuge League of Portland to support dog adoption. Be prepared—there’s almost always a cutie curled up behind the front desk.The Portland area abounds with breweries, some 28 of them according to the Maine Brewers’ Guild. In the city’s hip East Bayside neighborhood, five joints churn out everything from beer to cider, mead, spirits, kombucha, and, in the case of Urban Farm Fermentory, even gruit, an old-style beer brewed with backyard botanicals. Pop into the Shop, a seafood-centric eatery for Maine oysters (and, of course, beer). [Read about the top things to do for a great time in Portland.]Wild blueberries grow naturally in fields and barrens that stretch along the southwest coast.In 1911, motivated by his distaste for cold, wet feet, outdoorsman Leon Leonwood Bean created the Maine Hunting Shoe. Today a 16-foot replica of the iconic “duck boot” presides over L.L. Bean’s flagship store in Freeport and serves as the perfect prop for a road trip photo. Forgot to bring a sleeping bag? A lobster pot? A leash for Fido? You’ll find all three among the wares spread throughout the seven-acre retail campus. Christen your togs with a hike in nearby Wolfe’s Neck Woods State Park.Indie films, live music, and rotating exhibitions all have a home at Brunswick’s Fort Andross Mill, a cotton mill turned community hub on the banks of the Androscoggin River. The mill also houses the Brunswick Flea Market on Saturdays. Grab a latte from the coffee bar and head out for a stroll. Back in the day, mill workers from neighboring Topsham crossed the river using the Androscoggin Swinging Bridge, which now connects to the scenic Androscoggin Riverwalk. Worked up an appetite? Head to Asian-accented Tao Yuan, whose chef-owner Cara Stadler has been a semifinalist for James Beard’s Rising Star Chef of the Year award five times.When that first Maine winter proved too cold for comfort, settlers of the 1607 Popham colony built a boat to take them back across the pond. That vessel, Virginia of Sagadahoc, earned nearby Bath the right to call itself “the birthplace of American shipbuilding.” Visit the Virginia’s in-progress replica at the Bath Freight Shed, where shipbuilders work Wednesday through Saturday. In the town’s manufacturing heyday, 22 shipyards lined the Kennebec River, including the Bath Iron Works, which still makes vessels for the U.S. Navy. Get the full backstory (and board a river cruise) at the Maine Maritime Museum.The seafood is fresh off the boat at Portland's Harbor Fish Market.As with wine, an oyster’s flavor profile reflects the characteristics of its growing environment. The protected waters of the Damariscotta River help make it the Napa Valley of oysters, and many of Maine’s best loved farms sit along the shore. For a glimpse into Damariscotta’s thriving community, take an oyster ecology tour with Midcoast Kayak. Across the river, Shuck Station serves a selection of local oysters nestled on a bed of ice.The giant “EAT” sign on Rockland’s Main Street may signal food, but the exhibits beneath it in the Farnsworth Art Museum deliver nourishment of another variety. Created by Robert Indiana—best known for his “LOVE” sculptures—this sign makes an appropriate icon for a town with more than 20 galleries and museums. Art buffs will also appreciate 250 Main, a boutique hotel with rotating displays of creations by local artists.Mid-coast Maine’s sparkling Penobscot Bay is often studded with sailing vessels, many based in Camden’s harbor. Snap up a carryall made from recycled Maine sailcloth at the Sea Bags shop, then cast off on a sunset cruise complete with live music and sweet treats aboard the 100-year-old Schooner Surprise. If you have four or five extra days, set sail on a Maine Windjammer Association historic schooner, which stops at a deserted island for a classic lobster bake.",
"Wross Lawrence, a professional forager, collects mugwort at a park in East London. The plant has an aroma similar to sage and can be found growing throughout summer.For travelers stuck at home, the world is a wonder to contemplate—alas from afar. But one of the key goals of sustainable travel—to eat local with a mitigated environmental impact—might not require much more than a walk around the block.Urban foraging is an intimate study and interaction with the living world around us, singling out a flower or a berry, learning its name and properties, what it tastes like, when and where it grows, how to cook with it or preserve it.Long prized for its medicinal properties, mallow also works as a thickening agent and was the original ingredient of the marshmallow.With a taste slightly like apple and a high pectin content, hawthorn berries are excellent for making jams and condiments.Foraged foods are increasingly visible. In the fine-dining world, chefs have been crafting menus that are not only sourced locally from agricultural producers but, in some cases, sourced in the regions around a restaurant. There’s an appetite for it: According to a new Morning Consult/National Geographic poll, a third of Americans—especially those ages 18-34—say they are preparing more meatless meals because of higher prices and limited meat options at grocery stores.(Related: Will the sustainable travel movement survive coronavirus?)Travelers have likewise been turning to foraging as a way to experience a destination, with guided tours growing in popularity.No Taste Like Home, a 25-year-old foraging ecotour company based in the Appalachian town of Asheville, North Carolina, offers guided experiences for “modern hunter-gatherers.” Some of the collected bounty can then be savored at a local restaurant.With scientists estimating that we’ll need to feed two billion more people by 2050, the question of which diet is best has taken on new urgency. The foods we choose to eat in the coming decades will have dramatic consequences for the planet.Instead of looking to futuristic solutions, we might try looking to the past. Before agriculture was established, foraging helped feed our ancestors and heal their ailments. As a result, researchers are increasing efforts to learn what they can about foraging cultures, such as the Tsimane in the Amazon and the Hadza in Tanzania, before this way of life disappears.Lawrence forages wild food for Michelin-starred restaurants, markets, breweries, and supermarkets in London.I am now celebrating my 10th year as a forager, and I can tell you the yield is bountiful. On my shelves at the moment are sloe gin (infused with sloe berries, a fruit of the blackthorn bush), acorn schnapps, elderflower cordial, nettle pesto, rosehip ice cream, blackberry jam, dried wild mushrooms, and wild hop beer—all homemade and hand-picked from the streets, parks, and waterways of London.Foragers in the U.S. find an equal bounty—mulberry in Pennsylvania; loquats and kumquats in California; apples, pears, and plums in Wisconsin. Foraging can be both superlative and extreme. Florida-based environmentalist Rob Greenfield, for example, spent a year foraging or growing everything he ate, from grapefruit plucked from a neighboring tree to daikon radish cultivated in his own garden.(Related: Explore photos of these beautiful Zen gardens.)The large citric petals of the magnolia can be pickled to yield the best flavor.Rosehips, the fruit of a rose plant, are rich in vitamin C and can be used to make jam or herbal teas.With its distinctive aroma, Britain’s wild garlic can be found carpeting the floor of woodland, cemeteries, and parks in springtime.I have not always spent my days rifling through hedgerows, long grass, backstreets, and woodlands in search of wild food for Michelin-starred restaurants, markets, breweries, and supermarkets in London. For many years I worked as a deep-sea fisherman in my hometown of Tenby in southwest Wales. But after years of getting up in the middle of the night to head out into the dark, frigid Irish Sea, I decided it was time for a change. Back on land, I trained and worked as a tree surgeon for three years—which opened my eyes to all things wild and foraged.In my opinion everybody should be able to experience the benefits of foraging, especially now at a time when panic buyers often empty local supermarket shelves and stay-at-home orders limit travel. Foraging connects us with nature in a way that is healing mentally and physically in times of stress and anxiety. With fewer cars on the roads and people rushing past, and less noise pollution, now is the time to become more familiar with your natural environment.Heading out on a forage, you’ll experience new smells, tastes, colors, textures, patterns, and a satisfying sense of achievement. It can be done by anyone almost anywhere, and it doesn’t cost a dime. Wandering the streets, you start to see new areas of the little nook in which your life takes place. You notice things you used to walk past every day without acknowledgement, now seeing them in a different light, and discovering whole areas and communities you never knew existed before this new habit of meandering with purpose took ahold of you.(Related: Here’s how nature helps our brains.)I derive endless joy from this simple act and have found that it becomes involuntary and addictive once you start. There is so much to learn and all of it surprising and interesting. Take yarrow, for example, a plant that the Greek hero Achilles is said to have used to treat his soldiers’ wounds during the battle of Troy. Or mallow, a plant that a French confectioner used to create the world-famous fireside treat in the 1800s. Or a walnut tree, which produces a hard-shelled nut that people pay good money for at the grocers—probably shipped in from overseas. And it’s dangling right there above your head.A rowan tree, the berries of which make a tasty jam, grows outside an apartment block in East London.If you do venture out without a guide, be sure to triple-check your finds with multiple sources, and eat what you’ve collected only if you’re completely confident in your ID. Useful guidebooks include Richard Mabey’s Food for Free.These plants are all high in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, far better for you than almost anything you will find at the store, and without the pesticides. They also serve medicinal purposes. A few leaves of mullein—a large, hairy-leafed plant that looks like sage on steroids—produces a tea that soothes sore throats. The bluish-green needles of the white pine tree can be steeped in hot water and honey to make a cough syrup that alleviates chest congestion.Wonder plants like these can be found growing all over cities and towns, pushing out of the cracks in concrete, climbing a park fence, overhanging a cemetery gateway, edging a waterway. Once you begin to notice them, you start to see them everywhere.I believe foraging and botany should be introduced to us from an early age. Growing up learning about all the different plant genera, families, and species sparks an interest and connects children to nature. These children will grow into the architects, bankers, and politicians that will shape our cities and living environments in the future.My worst fear is that when this pandemic crisis is over things will go back to “normal”—even though normal wasn’t working, as the planet and its wildlife became secondary to economic and technologic priorities. Perhaps during this period, as we find ourselves keenly aware of our restricted access to the outdoors, we’ll take the time to think more about our vital relationship with the natural world.Foraging, no matter where you are, is a good place to start.",
"Travelers approach their gates at Milan’s Malpensa International Airport, Italy, in 2016.To moderate effect in 2019, a global environmental movement called “flight shaming” encouraged travelers to avoid air travel. Now a global pandemic is forcing them to.Earth Day 2020—marking the environmental initiative’s 50th anniversary—comes at a time when both a climate crisis and a global health crisis are forcing the travel industry to reckon with its future.Globally, the transportation sector is responsible for a quarter of carbon emissions. Aviation accounts for just over two percent of that, and before the beginning of this year, the number of people taking commercial flights was steadily increasing.But concern about the irreparable harm of flights’ carbon emissions is causing a growing group of travelers to change its habits. Proponents of greener tourism are optimistic that the coronavirus outbreak won’t change that.According to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the nation responsible for the largest share of aviation-related carbon emissions is the U.S., followed by China. A 2017 ICCT survery found a small portion of the population produces the bulk of carbon emissions. To put this in perspective: That year, 12 percent of Americans accounted for 68 percent of global air travel; just over fifty percent of Americans said they hadn’t flown at all.This disparity has fueled the flight-shaming movement.“Last summer I went by train to Barcelona,” says U.K.-based Clare Farrell, co-founder of environmental action group Extinction Rebellion and a prominent proponent of limiting air travel. “I took my bike on the train and it was super cool. It’s a very pleasant way to travel, compared with airport rigamarole.”In 2018, Farrell and several other activists went on hunger strike to protest expansion of London’s Heathrow Airport. The flight shaming movement gained greater visibility in the U.S. last September when youth climate activist Greta Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic to reach a U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York City.Has the flight shaming movement resulted in fewer flights? It depends on who you ask—and where they are living. A survey of 6,000 people in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and France, conducted by Swiss bank UBS at the end of last year, found that 21 percent chose to fly less. This runs contrary to statistics indicating that 2019 was a record year for air travel in the U.S. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics shows 926 million people flew in 2019, up four percent from the previous year and nine percent from the previous two years.In February 2020, environmental campaigners protested in London, England about a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport.Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director of travel website The Points Guy, says that while its community of readers and travelers is conscious of its environmental footprint, that doesn’t determine whether someone would choose to take a trip. “There was definitely an interest from people [in reducing their carbon footprint],” he says. “No one wants to hurt the climate, [but] it was never at the center of most travelers’ agenda[s].”“As much as I want to be green, cost is a bigger factor,” says Aalia Udalawa, a consultant at PKG HotelExperts and an avid traveler. She estimates she would spend as much as 20 percent more on more sustainable travel, but says many of the greener options she’s considered fall outside her budget.These reports echo a National Geographic and Morning Consult poll. In a survey taken just before the COVID-19 pandemic we asked our readers if they would pay more to make sure that their vacations were environmentally friendly. A slim majority of 53 percent indicated they would not pay more (or had no opinion). This snapshot represents opinion before the coronavirus. What the future holds is up for debate.The challenge of helping travelers make sustainable choices surfaced in another National Geographic report from 2019. According to the survey of 3,500 adults, while 42 percent of U.S. travelers would be willing to prioritize sustainable travel in the future, only 15 percent of these travelers were sufficiently familiar with what sustainable travel actually means. The future opportunity will be to help travelers focus on environmentally friendly practices, protect cultural and natural heritage, and support social and economic benefit for local communities, among other goals.As interest in cleaner travel options grows, so do the options. “We’ve seen a great many travelers weigh alternatives to flights,” says Shannon McMahon, editor at online travel magazine SmarterTravel.com, a site owned by Trip Advisor. “Travelers seem to be taking a more holistic approach to how they contribute to carbon emissions than they did before just last year.”Riding the rails is one option. Although it often takes longer and costs more to travel by train, the carbon footprint is lower. One passenger’s flight from Paris to Barcelona creates an estimated 238kg of carbon dioxide emissions, while the equivalent train journey emits just 11kg.Two women sit on the Shinkansen train just before it leaves Tokyo.In Europe, where flight shaming took off, trains have been promoted as the most sustainable way to travel. Modernized rail infrastructure, including upgraded tracks and stations, helps support this option. Europe’s passenger trains are largely electrified, as opposed to U.S. trains, which use both electric and diesel power. Importantly, how a country generates electricity matters for calculating green travel options. An electric train that generates energy from renewable or nuclear energy (a majority of France’s output, for instance) produces fewer emissions than one with electricity generated from coal.Carbon offsets are another option for green travelers. Feeling pressure from their customers, airlines including JetBlue have adopted offset programs to reduce their impact. But whether this is an effective climate strategy is a point for debate. Environmental activists say offsets simply help us fly guilt-free without meaningfully reducing our impact.(Related: What does “sustainable tourism” actually mean?)“It’s a flawed way to deal with climate change because the most emissions are coming from people with the most money—and those who’d do well to change systems and habits,” says Farrell. “It promotes the idea that you can pass off the problem to the next generation.”Such complicated decisions might make the prospect of travel seem too daunting altogether, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth it, advocates say.“It’s a delicate balance,” Mayerowitz says. Travel causes carbon emissions, but it also enriches people and communities. He, for instance loves to hike, which means he sometimes flies or drives to get to trailheads. But due to those journeys, Mayerowitz advocates for national parks and relays his love of them to a wider audience.Kelley Louise, the founder and executive director of Impact Travel Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable travel, says that rather than ceasing travel altogether, her organization advocates for innovating on it. One concept is based on slow travel, a philosophy and practice that emphasizes longer stays, alternative transportation (such as trains and bikes), cultural immersion, vacation rentals, and off-the-beaten-path destinations.“Travel has the powerful ability to transform you into an advocate for nature and conservation,” she says. “So if tourism professionals sat on their soapboxes and said the only thing you could do was to stop traveling, we’d lose all of the really beautiful components that traveling brings us.”Few people or segments of the global economy have been unscathed by the coronavirus outbreak, and that’s particularly true of the travel industry.“There had never been so much wealth and connectivity in the world,” says Mayerowitz of pre-coronavirus life. “The quick spread of this pandemic showed us just how connected we are. You had second-tier cities in the U.S. with non-stop flights to second-tier cities in China.”But what happens when travel bans are lifted? Will sustainable travel fall to the wayside in a world with redistributed wealth and greater wariness of connectivity?“Sustainable travel has been on the rise for years now. Not only is a global pandemic unlikely to change that—it could even make traveling sustainably seem more important than ever,” says McMahon.While the events aren’t the same, McMahon notes that tourism declined after the September 11 terrorist attacks and during the 2008 Great Recession. But then travel regained footing, first in local or regional journeys and eventually in international trips.“Travelers first tend to venture out closer to home—if past trend lines are consistent—and visit their local eateries, stay regionally for a weekend getaway, or travel domestically before a robust demand for international travel returns,” McMahon says.Mayerowitz says he expects travelers to seek out vacations that connect them to others. “People are going to want to network [with] local tours, trips with extended family,” he says.Louise, of Impact Travel Alliance, sees the sustainable travel movement keeping pace. While mass tourism is linked to climate change, overtourism, and conventional travel experiences, she says, sustainable tourism offers a healthier alternative for communities and for the planet.“My hope for the industry is that, when the pandemic subsides, we’ll be able to explore the world with a renewed sense of mindfulness, curiosity, and appreciation,” she says.",
"Coral reforestation helps restore desolated reefs around Landaa Giraavaru Island on Baa Atoll in the Republic of Maldives.The word “overtourism” is a relatively new term—but its novelty has not diminished the portent of its meaning: “An excessive number of tourist visits to a popular destination or attraction, resulting in damage to the local environment and historical sites and in poorer quality of life for residents,” according to the Oxford Dictionary.As travel recovers from pandemic lows, travelers are once again experiencing the consequences of overtourism at enticing, but crowded, destinations. The UN World Tourism Organization, along with public and private sector partners, marks September 27 as World Tourism Day and uses this platform to discuss tourism’s social, political, economic, and environmental impacts.This day highlights the importance of sustainable tourism—a framework for engaging travelers and the travel industry at large in supporting goals that include protecting the environment, addressing climate change, minimizing plastic consumption, and expanding economic development in communities affected by tourism.A National Geographic survey of 3,500 adults in the U.S. reveals strong support for sustainability. That’s the good news—but the challenge will be helping travelers take meaningful actions. According to the survey—which was conducted in 2019—while 42 percent of U.S. travelers would be willing to prioritize sustainable travel in the future, only 15 percent of these travelers are sufficiently familiar with what sustainable travel actually means.(Learn about how to turn overtourism into sustainable global tourism.)In the National Geographic survey, consumers most familiar with sustainable travel are young: 50 percent are 18 to 34 years old. Among travelers who understand the sustainable travel concept, 56 percent acknowledge travel has an impact on local communities and that it’s important to protect natural sites and cultural places.The survey has informed National Geographic’s experiential travel and media businesses and sparked conversations for creating solutions around sustainability. Our travel content focuses on environmentally friendly practices, protecting cultural and natural heritage, providing social and economic benefits for local communities, and inspiring travelers to become conservation ambassadors. In short, we see every National Geographic traveler as a curious explorer who seeks to build an ethic of conserving all that makes a destination unique.National Geographic Expeditions operates hundreds of trips each year, spanning all seven continents and more than 80 destinations. Rooted in the National Geographic Society’s legacy of exploration, the company supports the Society's mission to inspire people to care about the planet by providing meaningful opportunities to explore it. Proceeds from all travel programs support the Society’s efforts to increase global understanding through exploration, education and scientific research.National Geographic Expeditions offers a range of group travel experiences, including land expeditions, cruises, and active adventures, many of which take place around eco-lodges that are rigorously vetted for their sustainability practices.These independent lodges incorporate innovative sustainability practices into their everyday operations, including supporting natural and cultural heritage, sourcing products regionally, and giving back to the local community.For example, South Africa’s Grootbos Lodge launched a foundation to support the Masakhane Community Farm and Training Centre. Through this program, the lodge has given plots of land to local people who have completed the training, increasing their income and access to local, healthy foods; so far the program has benefitted more than 138 community members.As a media brand, National Geographic encourages travelers to seek out and support properties that embrace a mission to help protect people and the environment. Not only do these accommodations make direct and meaningful impacts in their own communities, but staying at one helps educate travelers in effective ways to preserve and protect the places they visit.The travel industry is crucially dependent on the health of local communities, environments, and cultures. As many experts note, we need to invest in the resiliency of places affected by overtourism and climate change to achieve sustainable tourism.(Should some of the world’s endangered places be off-limits to tourists?)National Geographic’s coverage stresses the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and encourages travelers to step off the beaten path and linger longer, respect cultural differences and invest in communities, reconnect with nature and support organizations that are protecting the planet. Here are 12 ways to travel sustainably, reported by our staff editors.Storytelling can help by highlighting problems brought on by tourism and surfacing practices and technologies to mitigate negative impacts. A key goal of our storytelling mission at National Geographic Travel is to dig deeper into the topic of sustainable tourism and provide resources, practical tips, and destination advice for travelers who seek to explore the world in all its beauty—while leaving behind a lighter footprint.",
"Over seven million people visit "La Joconde," or the Mona Lisa, by Leonardo Da Vinci at the Louvre Museum in Paris each year.Reykjavík isn’t what it used to be. The Icelandic capital’s main shopping street, Laugavegur, now belongs to tourism. Shops bill themselves in English, not Icelandic: Icemart, Chuck Norris Grill, a “Woolcano” gift shop. A lone hardware store has survived the wave of touristification.The term “overtourism”—too many tourists—has been moving from travel-industry jargon into the mainstream, propelled by such flash points as Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona, where exasperated locals unfurled “TOURIST GO HOME” banners in 2017.The phenomenon is global and has even reached chilly, expensive Iceland—a relative newcomer to travelers’ bucket lists. Travel media have affixed the overtourism label not just to Reykjavík but to the whole country. So when I arrive after eight years away, I am apprehensive. How bad will it be? And how can travelers be part of the solution, not part of the problem? [Find amazing alternatives to destinations experiencing overtourism.]I first explored Iceland as a recent college grad in 1973, entranced by vast scenery, the modern culture with its Old Norse language, and the in-your-face volcanic geology. I kept coming back, making my previous visit in 2010, right before the tourism boom. By 2017, Iceland was drawing over two million visitors annually—six times its national population.The Blue Lagoon may be one of Iceland’s most popular attractions, but author Jonathan Tourtellot says it’s actually the one place in Iceland he’s not worried about. “It’s entirely artificial, well managed, handy to the airport, and expensive,” he says.When does such a fast-rising tide become an unacceptable tsunami? For Icelanders who are not making money from tourism—and even for those who are—overtourism means disruption to their lives and their city. “The Reykjavík center is all hotels and Airbnbs now,” says my friend Ingibjörg Eliasdóttir. “Downtown is out of hand. Real estate prices have gone up so high that students can’t afford to live here anymore.”The tourism flood would have arrived sooner or later. The number of international trips taken each year worldwide has gone from some 25 million in the 1950s, right before the commercial jet age began, to 1.3 billion in 2017. International arrivals are projected to reach a possible three billion by 2050. Yet the sights and places all these people visit remain the same size.Causes of the tourism surge reportedly range from easier border crossings and cheap regional carriers to subsidized airline fuel and Airbnb, which increases a destination’s accommodations capacity. Look deeper, though, and you find three powerful trends. First, Earth’s population has nearly tripled since the 1950s, when mass tourism was just getting started. Second, affluence is growing even faster, with the world’s middle class expected to reach 4.2 billion by 2022. Third, technological changes from GPS and social media to wide-body jets and towering cruise ships carrying town-size populations have revolutionized travel.I once complained to the CEO of a major cruise line about how each ship disgorges thousands of passengers into the confined medieval streets of Dubrovnik, Croatia. “Don’t people have a right to visit Dubrovnik?” he countered. Perhaps, but when people keep arriving in groups of 3,000, it profoundly changes a place.Airlines can boost heavy traffic as well. Icelandair’s free-stopover offers put hundreds of tourists daily on the accessible Golden Circle route, which takes in the historic site of Thingvellir, the Gullfoss waterfall, and geothermal Geysir. The first two are large enough to handle several hundred visitors, but compact Geysir shows signs of overtourism—trash, overcrowding, and a tourist-trap sprawl mall right across the road.This fast-growing mass travel poses real threats to natural and cultural treasures. Wear and tear on fragile sites is one issue. So is cultural disruption for local people. And visitors receive a degraded experience. [Discover 6 ways to be a more sustainable traveler.]Pressure for change comes less from tourists than from locals and preservationists. Officials in Barcelona, one of the world’s busiest cruise ports, have promised tighter controls on mass tourism, short-term apartment rentals, hotel development, and other challenges. Dubrovnik has plans to restrict the number of ships that can dock. Italy’s Cinque Terre has put limits on hikers. Amsterdam is focusing on tourist redistribution techniques. In Asia, where tourism growth is rampant, governments have closed entire islands to allow recovery, such as on overbuilt Boracay in the Philippines and overtrodden Koh Tachai in Thailand. As for Iceland, the government has launched a Tourist Site Protection Fund, and Reykjavík has banned permits for new hotel construction downtown.The low sun casts long shadows, revealing the magnitude of the crowd size around the Strokkur Geyser in Iceland.Destination stakeholders are not the only ones who can take action. What can a smart traveler do?When you arrive in a place, you become part of that place. Where you go, what you do, how you spend, whom you talk to: It all makes a difference. Try to get out of the tourist bubble and see how locals live. Treat every purchase as a vote. In Iceland, María Reynisdóttir of the national tourism bureau suggests looking for the official quality label Vakinn when buying souvenirs or booking lodgings.Hit museums and sights early, before crowds arrive. Avoid peak seasons as well. [Visit the world's best museums.]Booking an Airbnb listing with a friendly host can add depth to your stay, but avoid hosts who peddle multiple units bought just for short-term rentals. That practice can boost property values beyond what locals can afford.Tell tourism authorities what you think. They worry about reputation. Post online reviews about whether you think the destination is doing a good job of managing tourism.Earth is a big place, and much of it is still undervisited. In Iceland this past August, my wife and I headed north to see where a sign-posted route called the Arctic Coast Way will open in June 2019. Here, far from Reykjavík and well beyond the tour buses relentlessly plying Route 1, we drive past fjords touched by fingers of fog and mountainsides laced with waterfalls.Just short of the Arctic Circle we stop at the Guest-house Gimbur, empty except for us. “Mid-August is the end of the season,” explains our hostess, Sjöfn Guðmundsdóttir. Relaxing in her hot tub, watching a lingering sunset at the southernmost reaches of the Arctic Ocean, I reflect on something else she said: “Slow tourism is my motto.” It can be yours too.",
"Tourists fill St. Mark's Square in Venice. One of the easiest ways to help protect popular sites and alleviate the pressure of overtourism is to abandon the beaten path and opt for alternative destinations.While we have the potential to positively impact the places we visit—infusing money into local economies, supporting conservation projects and local artisans, and building bridges across cultures, we also run the risk of destroying the very things we love.From Canada to Thailand to Croatia, budget airlines and cruise ships are delivering visitors in record numbers, overwhelming and even damaging historic cities and natural sites around the world. As tourists flood into destinations such as Venice and Dubrovnik, residents are forced out and frustrated to the point of protest.The Adventure Travel Trade Association’s “20 Travel Trends to Watch in 2018” report warns that “adventure destinations, often located in fragile environments and with less built infrastructure, need to pay attention to the dialogue around preventing and managing overtourism, because the destruction of the world’s most pristine and special places is irreversible.”Rather than being part of the problem, travelers can actively support solutions. One of the easiest ways to help protect popular sites and alleviate the pressure of overtourism is to abandon the beaten path and opt for alternative destinations.Ljubljana, Slovenia, is a great alternative if you are seeking romantic waterways to enjoy.It’s no secret that Venice and its residents are struggling with tourism. And we can’t blame them. The impact of boatloads of travelers—around 60,000 visitors that descend on this fragile city each day—has transformed it from its former status of “La Serenissima” (“most serene”) into anything but. Throngs of people, overcrowded canals, damaged ecosystems, skyrocketing rents, and authentic artisan shops replaced by cheap souvenir stores have dramatically changed the quality of life, forcing out some thousand residents each year and threatening the city’s UNESCO status. If you love Venice, do the Floating City a favor and let it go for now.Just across the border in Slovenia, the peaceful, rolling hills of Brda wine country await. This “Tuscany of Slovenia” has spectacular views, hospitality as gentle as the hills, decadent food and wines that easily rival Italy’s, and even some medieval architecture—minus the crowds. If you really can’t do without waterways, head further west to Ljubljana, where you can cruise to your heart’s content on the jade-colored river that winds through this friendly, eco-conscious capital city. [Slovenia was named the world's most sustainable country in 2017.]There’s no denying it: Thailand is home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. But popularity has a price. Beloved beaches of Phuket, Koh Phi Phi, and others in the Andaman Sea have attracted so much tourism attention that the natural environment and local way of life have been deeply, and potentially irreversibly, impacted.If it’s sun and sand you seek, why not head to Mozambique? This southern African country has more than 1,500 miles of coastline along the Indian Ocean—much of which is insanely stunning and unspoiled. Island-hop between offshore archipelagos, snorkel the pristine waters, or simply lounge on a secluded beach with a good book, a glass of South African wine, and the ocean breeze.If you’re looking for a long trail where you can do some solo soul-searching à la Reese Witherspoon’s character in Wild, the Pacific Crest Trail—the very one she trekked—is likely to be a letdown. With more hiking permits issued in 2017 than actual miles of trail, this thru-hike has become too popular for its own good. A dramatic increase in hikers is endangering the natural environment that made it an appealing escape to begin with.Ambitious adventurers seeking solitude can instead set out on the Jordan Trail, a recently established, 400-mile trek across the entire length of this Middle Eastern country. You are certain to face physical and mental challenges—not to mention otherworldly, steal-your-breath scenescapes—as you trek through 52 communities and a variety of terrains during your cross-country journey. And if you still haven’t had your fill after 400 miles, consider crossing the border into the Palestinian territories and add the Masar Ibrahim al-Khalil long-distance cultural trail to your plans.Even from photos alone, Banff’s postcard-perfect Canadian Rocky Mountain peaks and glacier lakes are easy to fall in love with. This Alberta outdoor adventure destination attracts a significant number of visitors—nearly three million between April and September alone.Rather than battle for photo ops in Banff, consider crossing the border into British Columbia to commune with nature in Yoho National Park. Here you can hike, snowshoe, spot wildlife and wild orchids, kayak on aptly named and gorgeously green Emerald Lake, and explore the Burgess Shale Fossil Beds without bumping into busloads of tourists.Long revered as a significant spiritual sanctuary, Bali in recent years has become overrun by international backpackers, Instagrammers, yogis, and surfers. The intense uptick in tourists has led to an increase in prices, crowds, and strain on natural resources—and consequently a decline in the quality of life and experiences for locals and visitors alike.While there are still some quiet corners of Bali to enjoy, it’s best to leave the hordes of holidaymakers behind and branch out. Indonesia is made up of thousands of islands, so you won’t even have to leave the archipelago to find an alternative. Beckoning with idyllic, white-sand beaches and thriving, healthy reefs, the Raja Ampat Islands are heaven on Earth. Whether you’re an underwater enthusiast, want to stroll through the jungle and spot tropical birds and wildlife, or simply desire a peaceful place to kick back and relax, you’ll find all the serenity you seek—and none of the crowds—here.Is it the steamy Instagram shot or a hot springs experience you’re after? Iceland offers both in multiple locations beyond the Blue Lagoon. The Land of Fire and Ice is home to innumerable streams, springs, rivers, and lakes that make for incredibly relaxing settings to soak in.You can escape the throngs of tourists and still enjoy the same kind of aquamarine-colored water at Myvatn Nature Baths in northern Iceland. Traveling farther afield not only means fewer people in the pools but also increases your chances of catching sight of the aurora borealis.Alternatively, more adventurous travelers will enjoy the challenge of reaching the geothermal pools inside the caves of Grjotagja—a northwestern setting so magical it’s appeared on a Game of Thrones episode, or the hot stream at Reykjadalur (located just an hour southwest of Reykjavik).Buckling under the pressure of a trifecta of overtourism culprits—cruise ships, cheap flights, and Game of Thrones fame, Croatia’s historic seaside city of Dubrovnik has been forced to take measures to limit the number of daily visitors and protect its UNESCO status. Short-term tourists (some staying just mere hours) tend to invade the city en masse, take up space and use up resources, yet contribute little to the economy.While Dubrovnik deals with its popularity problems, consider exploring the culturally diverse and historically intriguing neighbor to the north: Bosnia and Herzegovina. What this Balkan country lacks in coastline, it more than makes up for with warm hospitality, endless hiking and skiing trails, and a variety of cultural influences—from Austro-Hungarian to Ottoman to Islam—that are reflected in the architecture, cuisine, music, and intriguing way of life.If you are visiting a popular destination, there are ways you can make the experience better for you and locals alike.Sunny Fitzgerald is a freelance writer, sustainable travel specialist, Lonely Planet Local, and a regular contributor to Kama`aina Magazine.

"Visit the island of Hvar on the off-season for secluded beaches and charming squares.Not to knock Dubrovnik, with its marble streets, 16th-century city walls, sparkling red roof tiles, and primo location—it more than earns its moniker of “Pearl of the Adriatic,” plus it's a UNESCO World Heritage site. But if you cross Croatia off your list after you’ve seen Dubrovnik, you’re missing out on a lot. Here are five other gems to discover.In midsummer it’s island madness, with party-lovers crowding the nightclubs in Hvar while their yachts crowd the harbor. But come shoulder season, the island reverts to its mysterious, medieval self, and you can explore the quiet squares and sandy coves in peace.Don’t miss the shady cloisters of the Franciscan Monastery and Museum, with its mesmerizing “Last Supper,” painted by Venetian artist Matteo Ingoli around the end of the 16th century, that completely fills the back wall of the dining hall. Lavender blankets the sunny hillsides in summer, and you can buy some to take home to remind of this fragrant island.Everywhere you look in Plitvice Lakes National Park, spearmint green and electric blue water is tumbling, frothing, roaring, pooling, plunging, and bubbling. Wooden boardwalks snake around and through and over waterfalls, streams, caves, and interconnected lakes formed by the gradual buildup of calcium carbonate since the Cretaceous era. Surprisingly, several popular Italian and German spaghetti Westerns were filmed in Plitvice (the landscape was intended to pass for the American West, at least to European eyes).This unique natural paradise offers abundant opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, rafting, biking, and hiking. Wildlife is also a big draw; the beech forests that dominate the area are home to deer, bears, wolves, wild boar, and a delightful array of bird species. As you wait for the ferry to take you across the lake, stop by one of the strudel stands for a delicious local specialty in a variety of flavors. Tip: Spend the night in one of the local inns so you can hit the trails early.When the Roman emperor Diocletian decided to retire at the beginning of the fourth century, he built himself a super-sized palace on the Dalmatian coast, a complex that was in fact equal parts personal villa and military garrison. UNESCO describes the palace—which now forms the center of modern-day Split—as “one of the most famous and integral architectural and cultural buildings on the Croatian Adriatic coast.”Diocletian’s compound was built to last, and by the Middle Ages, a town had begun to grow within its walls. Today, visitors and locals can stroll side-by-side in this village-inside-a-palace, where shops and cafés thrive. Palm trees shade the waterfront promenade, where you can catch a ferry to many of the substantial islands off Croatia’s long coastline.Croatia’s capital city feels rather like a huge college campus, maybe because it’s home to the 65,000 students at the University of Zagreb, founded by Emperor and King Leopold I Habsburg in 1669. Cars are banned in some areas, allowing cafés to sprawl into the streets and the creative class to take full advantage of the outdoor living spaces. Theater, farmers markets, public sculptures in tucked-away places (look for a pensive Nikola Tesla), soccer, music in the streets—it’s all here.On an ordinary weekday evening, Jelačić Square, Zagreb’s great central plaza, reverberates with sound, but it’s human, not automotive: All you hear are people talking, children chasing each other, plates and glasses clinking, and the occasional clack of an approaching blue tram. Order a gelato and join the fun.Enter Zadar’s Old Town at twilight through the imposing 16th-century Land Gate, a grand entryway to the city built by the Venetians and adorned with their trademark winged lion, a symbol of St. Mark. Wander a labyrinth of narrow stone alleyways packed with fashionable shops, restaurants, and people—and, happily, no cars. Suddenly the jumble of streets opens up to a large square, the remains of a Roman forum, where kids jump their skateboards over antiquities in front of the round, ninth-century church of St. Donatus.Along the seaside promenade, just past the ferry dock, you may detect haunting sounds reminiscent of whale songs. In 2005, Croatian architect Nikola Bašić built stone steps that lead down to the Adriatic, and placed 35 organ pipes beneath them. The natural forces of the wind and the waves push air against the pipes, creating mysterious chords. When the wind and waves are strong, the music is louder, and when it’s relatively calm, the Sea Organ, as the award-winning installation has been dubbed, falls quiet. Follow my lead and sit on the steps, listening to the magical sea music as the sun sets into the ocean and the stars come out.Marilyn Terrell is the former chief researcher at National Geographic Traveler magazine.

"The church of St. John the Baptist sits behind Bohinj Lake in Slovenia.The numbers give rise to the reason: There were 25 million international tourists in 1950. Last year, more than one billion globetrotters set out to see the world’s cultural and natural wonders—from the Serengeti’s Great Migration to the ancient Inca cities of Peru. We now have more places to go and more ways to get there than ever before. With that comes an even greater responsibility to safeguard our fragile planet for future generations.As the United Nations heralds 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, one place rises above the rest: Slovenia. Last year this Adriatic enclave, nestled amid emerald fields, snowy peaks, and sparkling waters, was declared the world’s most sustainable country. Slovenia achieved an eye-opening 96 out of 100 detailed sustainability indicators (think environment and climate, culture and authenticity, nature and biodiversity, among others.) And its quaint capital Ljubljana was also anointed Europe’s Greenest Capital in 2016 by the European Union.But if the academics of going green sound more fitting for a graduate school thesis than for planning a great vacation, consider this: Nearly 60 percent of Slovenia is covered in lush forests, and more than 40 parks and reserves are home to some 20,000 different plants and animals, with a network of diverse hiking trails. Meandering country roads also link pristine lakes to cobblestone towns, where local cafes serve up traditional fare like štruklji (savory veggie and meat pockets), washed down with some of Europe’s least known yet tastiest vintages. All in a nation smaller than New Jersey, with a population of just over two million.This article originally published on March 8, 2017. It has been updated.",
"A hiker passes glaciers and snowfieldsAmerica is the birthplace of numerous long-distance trails, and, if we do say so ourselves, it still harbors some of the world’s best. “Our country has a pretty good network of hiking trails,” says Andrew Skurka, who has done the three longest—the Continental Divide, Appalachian Trail, and Pacific Crest Trails—as well as a host of other lesser known paths.  One of his all-time favorites is the 1,200-mile Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. “In terms of scenery, the Pacific Northwest Trail is pretty solid,” says Skurka. “It’s more scenic than the others, but it’s not as well established.” It passes through three national parks, seven national forests, the Rockies, North Cascades, and Olympic Mountains, and some of the lower 48’s most remote territory. Despite the promise of scenery, it’s still relatively unfrequented, which means hikers often have the unencumbered mountain views, thick forests, and soaring volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest all to themselves.  The Pacific Northwest Trail Association has information on the trail and maps. Parts of the trail are accessible by day hikers and short-haul backpackers.

"Conner Born lies in a hammock as the sun rises on Moraine Lake and the Valley of the Ten Peaks in Banff, Banff National Park.The maple leaves are everywhere: red ones on white T-shirts, white ones on red T-shirts. They’re screen-printed on bunting, chalked onto sidewalks, painted on faces, emblazoned on dog collars.It is July 1 in Banff, Alberta, and residents are celebrating Canada Day as the country readies for the big bash in 2017, when Canada marks its 150th anniversary as a nation. The food stalls offer bison jerky and stone-fruit juices and vegetable samosas. Performers are attired in costumes from many lands. Singers belt out a universal message of love and harmony in many tongues.A stranger hands me a paper Canadian flag and we make our way to the parade route along Banff Avenue. Many of us are from the U.S. or China or India, and we know only two words in the lyrics of the national anthem. But we all gamely chime in with “O Canada” at the right spots.From the red and the white all around me I look up and see blue and green. Banff is no ordinary small town. It sits in the middle of Canada’s first and arguably best national park, 2,500 square miles of Rocky Mountain splendor carpeted with pine and spruce trees and riddled with glaciers bleeding blue into clear lakes—a space big and bold enough to support huge numbers of wildlife, including such so-called megafauna as wolves, elk, cougars, moose, black bears, and grizzlies. A thought strikes me: People are puny; nature is the grand marshal of this parade.LEFT: From the summit of Sulphur Mountain, visitors can take in views of the Bow Valley and downtown Banff, which is reached in eight minutes by gondola.RIGHT: Silas Rezaian, 6, looks out to the mountains below from the top of Sulphur Mountain in Banff National Park.A few months ago I had an anxiety attack. Racing heart, tight chest, cold hands. My doctor said my cortisol levels were elevated. He prescribed vitamins and supplements to counteract the effects of a limbic hijacking and urged me to “meditate and eat dark chocolate.” So, besides popping chill pills, I’m biting into a Godiva daily and listening to a playlist of nouveau spiritualism by pop sages of the modern age. Had somebody close to me died? Was I experiencing some newly surfaced childhood trauma? Did my husband leave me for his secretary? No, no, and well, yes, but that was 20 years ago. So what was going on? Something embarrassingly trivial: I’m a recent empty-nester trying to write her next chapter.If that diagnosis is clear, the remedy is not. Our bodies have minds of their own. I felt as if I’d pushed off from one shore and hadn’t quite reached the other. So I escaped, to Canada, like a late-in-life runaway. I’m not unhappy. In fact, I had long anticipated this period after the kids went to college. But I live with a nagging question: What on Earth do I want?Right now I want to be in Banff. To be outdoors, hike, make new friends, and try to lose the thoughts that cobweb my brain in my suburban home-office outside Washington, D.C. This corner of the Rockies seems to me exactly what my meditation podcasts were telling me to visualize, but here I don’t have to close my eyes. I can open them.Elk can be seen throughout Banff National Park, often causing tourists to stop on the side of the road to watch and photograph wildlife along Lake Minnewanka Scenic Drive.I join my new Banff friends Sally and Alison one morning for their daily stroll with their dogs up 5,500-foot-high Tunnel Mountain, just east of downtown. We’re three 50-somethings in cropped yoga pants talking about nothing and everything. From an overlook we can see the turrets and dormers of the area’s oldest and most famous lodging, the castle-on-a-hill Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. Near the summit, Sally and Alison touch the trunk of a fir tree, its gnarled bark worn smooth by other hands. They touch for sick friends, for dogs long gone, for the fallen. I touch too, “for sisterhood,” I say.I had a short unhappy marriage and a long unhappy divorce. It was a slog, marked by custody battles for our two sons, tears, and trips to the therapist. I marvel at those who do it without family and friends—I had both. Looking back on those turbulent years, I realize I had an enviable clarity of purpose. My goal was the well-being of my sons; everything else was secondary. Now I miss the focus that gave me such direction.After the hike, I meet up with Alexia McKinnon at the Banff Center, an “arts and creativity incubator” at the base of Tunnel Mountain. McKinnon manages indigenous leadership programs. Hailing from the First Nations tribe of Champagne and Aishihik, up in Yukon Province, she tells me that Tunnel Mountain is also called Sleeping Buffalo Mountain. And, she adds, “according to the elders, it is a place of healing, especially for women.” Really? The mountain I just climbed with the gals and touched wood—that mountain? “No doubt you felt its energy,” she says.The town of Banff, at the convergence of three valleys and two rivers, was a place of gathering and trade for native nations, including those of the Stoney Nakoda, the Blackfoot, and the Tsuut’ina. Their influence continues to resonate. When I ask McKinnon what wisdom today’s elders offer, she smiles.“They ask us to be mindful every day, to listen to our ancestors, to the trees that give us air, to the rocks that clean the water, to the animals that give us food. They remind us that we are here as part of the continuum. We are here to honor those who came before and represent those who come after.” This mountain has a song, she tells me, “and I was called to the mountain by that song.”Canada is calling me. Twice this summer I’ve found myself north of the 48, first in Quebec and now in Banff. This land clears my head. From the mountains here in the Rockies to the prairies of Manitoba to the Atlantic coasts of Newfoundland, our neighbor feels more spacious, more accepting. To this American, Canada is what we might be if we got outside more.The Bridger Ski Foundation ski team takes a chilly swim after a training run at Lake Louise in Banff National Park.My iPhone is dead. My Fitbit too. The camera still works but it’s packed in the saddlebag and out of reach. I’m not even halfway into a two-day horse-packing excursion through the dense backcountry of Lake Louise, following the trails of early pioneers and their First Nations guides, and my fingers already seek something to tap, press, or swipe. Everywhere I turn I see Instagrammable moments, as the piney woods, glacier-fed lakes, snow-covered passes, and pointed peaks assemble themselves in countless permutations of perfect.The cowboy leading our group of four is Paul Peyto. Born in Banff, he and his wife, Sue, run Timberline Tours. Peyto has the bona fides. His great uncle Bill Peyto was one of the first wardens of Banff National Park, which was established in 1885. For his exploits, his name was attached to a lake, a glacier, a mountain, a creek, and a café.At camp the next morning, Peyto motions me over to his “weather station,” really a gap in the trees with a clear view of the creek below and Molar Mountain in the distance (which looks just like its name). If a storm develops, he can see it coming. We sip coffee, boiled with the grounds. No latte foam art here. Peyto doesn’t have children but he knows what ails today’s youth. “We were always outside, always working, always doing something—fishing, hiking, riding, skiing in wintertime. These kids now, they don’t want to do anything; that’s why they’re all four axe handles wide. And all the rivets and lock washers and stuff hanging off them, all them tattoos, I just shake my head.”The guy could give his own TED talk: Head outside, do chores. It’s a simple version of the “forest bathing” and digital detox that today’s parenting experts advocate for nature deficit disorder and our culture of consumerism.Paul Peyto, owner of Timberline Tours, guides his pack of horses and mules through the Lake Louise backcoutry by horseback in Banff National Park.After the horsepacking trip I check into the log-and-stone Num-Ti-Jah Lodge, on the blue lip of Bow Lake. Built in the 1940s by another Banff pioneer and mountain man, Jimmy Simpson, the lodge is now in the hands of Tim Whyte, who despite initial drops of rain, takes me on a hike to Bow Glacier Falls, across the lake. Raindrops soon turn into horizontal precipitation, and thunderclaps follow lightning.“I love this,” Whyte says. “I don’t do it enough.” Twenty years ago he gave up the executive suite for an innkeeper’s life following a bout of thyroid cancer. The work was harder, but he relished it. “Every now and then everyone needs to do a head check. Ask ourselves: Am I doing what I should be doing?”Hiking in a tempest—is this what I should be doing? In a word, yes.I’m itching to see a bear. Preferably in the company of Amar Anthwal, a ranger at the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, centered around a series of hot springs on the outskirts of downtown. The popular area, bounded on one side by Sulfur Mountain, abuts a wildlife corridor, so it’s a good place to spot the world’s largest omnivore. Anthwal, however, takes me to see snails. Barely the size of a pea, Banff spring snails are endangered, found nowhere else in the world but in the site’s sulfurous spring waters.“See, there’s one,” he says, pointing to a dark, slimy corner of one pool. “My job is to protect both the bears and the snails. We’ve come a long way as humans that this park is here to do both.” I get it. You can’t just save the good-looking creatures. But I must not be as highly evolved because I can’t muster much zest for the green blobs.During the construction of the transcontinental railway in the 1880s, workers found these hot springs, long known to First Nations people. To protect them, a reserve was established in 1885. Next came a marketer’s idea to build fancy lodges and encourage travelers to take the train West. This marked the birth of both tourism and the national parks system in Canada. At that time, protected reserves were dedicated more to the interests of tourism than to the ideals of conservation. First Nations peoples were evicted, big-game trophy hunting was promoted, lakes were stocked with non-native species for anglers, and the hot springs were “enhanced” with swimming pools and bathhouses. Today, Banff National Park is placing priority on environmental protection and redressing wrongs done to the original inhabitants. Wildlife overpasses and underpasses cross both the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, allowing safe passage to fauna, from gangly moose to elusive wolverines. Footage from hidden cameras on YouTube shows plenty of traffic on these animal highways.The exterior of Lake Agnes Tea House in Banff National Park.The bison, too, are returning: Parks Canada has plans to reintroduce a herd of about 30 next year. More significantly, First Nations peoples have been active participants in the process. According to Karsten Heuer, the park’s bison-reintroduction project manager, “Bison are to the plains and foothills culture what salmon are to coastal cultures and caribou are to northern ones. Daily life revolved around the bisons’ movements and rhythms, and from that, entire spiritual practices were born. Bringing bison back to Banff will help provide strength to those cultures. It’s a renewal.”Nice, but where’s my bear?“Be patient and present.” Anthwal sounds like one of my meditation podcasts. “The most difficult thing we need to give nature is time. Nature will not show you everything at once. But she will give you enough.”Back to where I started. I am standing along the Canada Day parade route with Hernan Argana, his wife, and their two daughters, some of the 2,000 immigrants from countries such as the Philippines (where the Arganas—and my parents—hail from) who form the bedrock of this resort town’s economy.“I love Canada,” says Hernan. “The people here have been so good to us. The teacher saw my children walking to school in the cold and organized a visit to the thrift shop where we could have anything we needed for free.” The family’s immigrant journey was difficult. He worked in Banff alone for seven long years to get his permanent residency, wiring most of his income to pay for his youngest daughter’s heart surgery in the Philippines. The Banff Western Union staff witnessed his weekly visits and took up a secret collection for his daughter’s medical costs. His family reunited with him in Canada four years ago.We watch the parade. The mayor, civic groups, and marching bands file past, followed by floats celebrating the ethnic groups that form the tapestry of Banff, and Canada—Filipinos, Japanese, Poles, Indians, Chinese, Scottish, Irish. About 20 percent of Canada’s population is foreign-born (compared to 13 percent in the U.S.). I think of my own family’s immigrant story. In the 1960s, my parents traveled to the U.S. to study and later raised their three children in Washington, D.C. My sisters and I, their husbands, and our blended-race offspring are a thoroughly American melting pot.This land isn’t my land, but it is a product of the same ideals. In large tracts of wilderness and small acts of kindness, Canada turns out to be the perfect place to escape without losing myself. To ask questions that I discover I already know the answers to. To give my better self room to grow.

"The northern lights stream down above Kirkjufell mountain in Iceland’s Snæfellsnes Peninsula.The otherworldly aurora borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself.For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.And remember: Besides weather, a dark sky and the right season are the keys. Try moonless nights.Even without the northern lights, Iceland is an otherworldly place to visit, with glaciers, geysers, massive waterfalls, and volcanoes. Both the latitude and longitude of the country favor aurora viewing, but the weather doesn’t always cooperate. However, a good coastline road around the country lets you chase clear skies.I have seen my best auroras from Kirkjufell mountain on the west coast. In high activity you can even spy the northern lights from the suburbs of Reykjavík; the Grotta Lighthouse is a popular viewing spot.Across the country, sky watchers can take in the dancing lights from outdoor hot tubs, inside Buubble lodges, and from hot spring lagoons.When to Go: Late August to early AprilIn Fairbanks, Alaska, the sky glows with the aurora borealis.Located just two degrees below the Arctic near international airport and close to the impressive Denali National Park, Fairbanks is the best place in the U.S. to take in the northern lights. It even has its own forecast system and offers tours to take visitors far from city lights.When to Go: Late August to mid-AprilThe aurora borealis spreads out above Prosperous Lake in Yellowknife, Canada.This Northwest Territories capital on the shores of Great Slave Lake boasts its own Aurora Village and special activities for northern lights tourism.Canada is an aurora viewing paradise, thanks to its northern latitude and low light pollution; elsewhere in the country, Wood Buffalo and Jasper National Park are popular viewing spots.When to Go: Mid-August to late April. For Churchill and Wood Buffalo, early August to early May.A fjord reflects the glowing green light of an aurora near Tromsø, Norway.The largest urban area in northern Norway is 217 miles north of the Arctic Circle, but thanks to the Gulf Stream the coastline has surprisingly moderate temperatures. It also has beautiful scenery, magnificent fjords, and the Lyngen Alps.I have seen spectacular auroras from the village of Ersfjordbotn, 12 miles from Tromsø. Other popular locations in the country are the Lofoten Islands and the far northern towns of Alta, Nordkapp, and Kirkenes.When to Go: Mid-September to late MarchThe northern lights swirl over a wooded area in northern Sweden.Sweden’s northernmost town of Kiruna is a gateway for nearby attractions. There is the ICEHOTEL, mountainous Abisko National Park, the local Sami culture, and plentiful reindeer. A short drive from the town takes you to a good spot for aurora viewing. The weather here is much more stable than the Norwegian coast, but it’s colder too.In Finland’s Lapland region, Rovaniemi serves as a gateway town to nearby national parks—where in winter you can spot frozen snow-covered trees called Tykky sculptures along with the northern lights.When to Go: Mid-September to late MarchClouds partially obscure an aurora above an iceberg in northeastern Greenland.It’s possible to be too far north to see the northern lights—such is the case in northern Greenland. But head farther south for beautiful auroras and attractions like Qaleraliq Glacier, which has small floating icebergs even in summer.When to Go: Mid-August to late April in the south and late August to mid-April in Nuuk.The southern lights illuminate the sky in Tasmania, Australia.You hear about northern lights more often than southern lights (aurora australis) because there are fewer locations to see auroras from the Southern Hemisphere. Your best chance is on the southern tip of both Tasmania (Australia) and New Zealand, where a dark sky will help you see any active auroras over the southern horizon. These are the closest accessible places to the south magnetic pole, outside of Antarctica.When to Go: Year round, but your best chances are near equinoxes.Babak Tafreshi is a photographer and the founder of The World at Night (TWAN) photography program.

"Colorful boats float along the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. Some of Bangkok's unique communities and traditions are at risk of disappearing to make room for large developments.If you’re traveling to Thailand’s City of Angels, you’re likely already planning to snack on street food, peruse the souvenir stalls and bars of infamous Khao San Road, and admire the ornate architecture at the Grand Palace. But if you want to experience the beating heart of this spirited city, you’ll need to dig a little deeper and wander a little further from the touristic sites into the alleyways of neighboring historic communities—before it’s too late.“We are losing the heart and soul of Bangkok,” warns Michael Biedassek, a Thai-German Bangkokian and the founder of ethical travel company Bangkok Vanguards.Some of Bangkok’s oldest and most culturally rich communities and traditions are currently under threat, as new development projects move in and push older, historic communities out. Even the very street stalls that put the metropolis on the map are at risk of disappearing, with the government announcing a ban on street vendors in an effort to “clean up” the capital.“The people, food, traditions, architecture, and the way of life tell you a lot about the DNA of a place,” Biedassek explains. “If everything is developed into large corporations, then you lose the character of the place and everything is replaceable—you can find the same corporations in other cities around the world. And if Bangkok’s DNA is wiped out, what are we left with? It will just be a copy of other international cities.”Biedassek and his team are working to protect the DNA of their beloved Bangkok by offering locally guided, community-based tours through historically significant areas around the city. These educational explorations not only provide an unparalleled experience to travelers, they build a bridge between visitors and locals, create a deeper connection to the city, bring in tourism money, and highlight these endangered communities' cultural and historic value.As travelers, we may feel powerless—even partially responsible—in the face of the development of popular destinations. Although we may not always have the opportunity to speak directly to local policymakers, we do have choices about where we spend our time and money. And we can let our dollars do the talking.Here are four places to visit in Bangkok—while you still can.Located in one of the world’s largest Chinatowns, this community has a long history—dating back to the 1700s—of contributing to Bangkok’s economy and gastronomy. Wander the colorful streets, shops, and temples of Charoen Chai for a chance to admire the historic architecture and witness spiritual Chinese rituals as well as traditional culture in commerce.While the street scene of Charoen Chai (Charoenkrung Road Soi 23) is a living museum in and of itself, the community also opened their own museum and community center to showcase the value of their neighborhood and culture, and share it with visitors. A trip to the museum affords travelers a chance to better understand Charoen Chai while also contributing to the local economy.You don’t have to go it alone; Biedassek and his Bangkok Vanguards team offer personalized, in-depth walking tours through the neighborhood. Suitably—yet sadly—named Bye Bye Chinatown, these guided tours bring visitors closer to the culture, cuisine, and residents of this important heritage neighborhood.In April 2017, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration announced a ban on street food, in an effort to “clean up” this capital that’s internationally recognized for its street food. The popular food stalls of Yaowarat are being spared, for now.Known as a culinary oasis in the heart of Bangkok for over 200 years, Nang Loeng is much more than a market. It’s a community composed of a medley of Asian cultures, flavors, scents, and sounds that entice local and international gastronomy lovers alike.What began as a fresh produce market in 1900 has transformed into a lively food court, lined with restaurants and vendors preparing recipes passed down through generations. With the construction of a new subway line (the MRT Orange Line), further development of the area could likely follow. Don’t miss the chance to sample some of the best curries and kanom (desserts) Bangkok has to offer. Head over to Democracy Monument, where you can walk five to 10 minutes or catch a cab to Nang Loeng from there.In April 2017, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) announced a ban on street food and declared it would clear street vendors off the city’s sidewalks by the end of 2017. They've already made good on that promise in the central shopping areas around Siam Square and Pratunam.The governor has said he will spare Yaowarat and Khao San Road for the time being, and the city has not yet been completely cleansed of street stalls. It’s unclear what the street food ban will mean for the future of the many street vendors that feed not only locals but the economy and tourism industry as well. Be sure to get your fill of street foods while you still can—some of the tastiest street treats are available at Yaowarat Road and Wang Lang Market.Bangkok’s klongs (canals) were once transportation and trading routes teeming with activity. Over the years, the majority of them have been filled in to quite literally pave the way for development. While some of the communities along the few remaining klongs are intact, others—particularly along the Chao Phraya River—have been targeted for development.And some, like Pom Mahakan, have already fallen victim. Until recently, this heritage community tucked away in an unassuming neighborhood between the Ong Ang Canal and the old city wall was home to one of the last remaining clusters of teakwood houses in the city. It was an unofficial living museum—an extant tribute to Bangkok’s past, abuzz with local life and culture. Now, city officials are razing the irreplaceable historic homes to make way for a park intended to attract tourists, effectively demolishing the very architecture and essence of local life that has long drawn visitors to this neighborhood.The battle over this contended community started in the 1990s when the BMA began making moves to reclaim the land. At that time, some residents agreed to sell their homes, which were subsequently demolished, while others resisted and were consequently handed eviction notices. Until May 2018, the few remaining resolute residents held their ground, proposing a compromise: to create a small park and conserve the homes and community as a living heritage museum to be managed by the inhabitants themselves who were eager to share their way of life with visitors—rather than abandon their homes and have their lives reduced to a few words etched into cement slabs.Ultimately, the BMA won out, stripping Bangkok of a significant piece of its heritage and leaving Pom Mahakan residents devastated and homeless.“I was invited to the final dinner with the community before their houses were to be demolished,” Biedassek shares. “The despair was overwhelming. The government didn’t keep the promise to preserve these architecturally unique and historically significant buildings—the last of their kind in the city. This authentic history, a living link to the very beginnings of Bangkok, has been completely erased from the map.”Biedassek and other locals wonder if any place is safe from destruction.“I’ve seen development plans for my neighborhood [along the canals],” Biedassek says. “it looks as if they have plans to build a street or promenade all the way out to the old city wall. If they pick up these plans, they may very well move on to developing the edges of the promenade—which could directly affect the community I live in.”One of the ways Biedassek believes he can fight back is to demonstrate the value of these heritage communities and continue introducing visitors to the DNA of Bangkok, the local people, the deep history, and the way of life that this city was built upon. In an effort to allow travelers to immerse themselves in canal life before it’s gone, he recently opened Innspire—an old artist home in a klong community that he and his team transformed into a guesthouse.Biedassek and the Bangkok Vanguards team continue to lead historic, culinary, and cultural tours through some of the canal communities and the surrounding historic core of the city. They weave their way through back alleys, stopping by street stalls to purchase snacks from local vendors, cruising the canal, chatting with residents, and even eating a meal in a local home. Through this experience visitors have an unprecedented opportunity to see the soul of this ever-changing capital through the eyes of a conscientious local—before it’s too late.Sunny Fitzgerald is a freelance writer, sustainable travel specialist, Lonely Planet Local, and a regular contributor to Kama`aina Magazine.

"A train glides past Switzerland's snowcapped mountains, one way travelers can see the world while reducing their carbon footprint.The United Nations designated 2017 the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development—an opportunity to raise global awareness about how responsible tourism can act as a vehicle for positive change.The three pillars of sustainable tourism are employing environmentally friendly practices (reduce, reuse, recycle); protecting cultural and natural heritage (restoring historic buildings or saving endangered species); and providing tangible social and economic benefits for local communities (ranging from upholding the rights of indigenous peoples to supporting fair wages for employees). Here are six things globetrotters can do to ease their impact on the planet:Become part of the emerging “slow travel” trend by going to fewer places and spending more time in each. Train travel is a good way to do this. Not only will you experience a deeper sense of place, you’ll also decrease your carbon footprint. Some of my favorite travel-by-train destinations include India, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and China.Many well-intentioned travelers bring sweets, used clothing, books, and pencils to hand out to children and villagers in developing nations. Sadly, this kind giving often has unintended consequences—it can sow community conflict and encourage a culture of dependency and begging. I watched two Maasai women in Africa fight over a T-shirt that a smiling tourist had handed out; in some parts of Asia, the first English words children learn are “Give me sweet.”It is better to give—be it money or goods—to reputable local organizations that work on social welfare programs, or to international groups that partner with them. A good one is Pack for a Purpose.The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling mass of human trash stretching across thousands of miles of the ocean, includes gazillions of throw-away plastic bottles and bags that will take hundreds of years, if ever, to break down—all the while wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems.Be a part of the solution by opting for locally purified water in recyclable glass bottles (in the tropics, I rely mainly on green coconuts to stay hydrated) and carrying tote bags in your luggage that you can use while perusing street markets and shops. Not only will this cut back on plastic waste, it will also reduce your carbon footprint–petroleum-based ingredients are a staple in manufacturing plastic bottles and bags.I explore on my own most of the time when I travel, but when I do seek out the services of a tour outfitter, I always ask three questions before signing on: What are some of your tour company’s environmentally friendly practices? Can you give me an example of how your trips help to protect and support wildlife or cultural heritage? Do you employ local guides on your trips?These days, any outfitter that cannot provide a clear answer is behind the times. Find another one.Locally made crafts and souvenirs are not always cheaper, but purchasing them ensures your contribution to the economy will have a more direct and positive impact.In Cancun, for example, some gift shops sell “traditional” Mexican sombreros that are imported from China because they cost less, while village artisans who make the hats by hand charge more. The difference is not just in the price. Buying the real sombreros supports authentic cultural heritage and provides needed jobs for the locals who make them.On a trip to Vietnam’s Halong Bay, I watched a group of American tourists haggling with villagers who were selling some of the most beautiful sea shells I have come across in my travels.Similarly, in Mongolia, I witnessed a couple of backpackers haggling at an outdoor market to buy a hand-stitched eagle hunter’s hat made from plush wolf fur. These travelers were inadvertently helping to support a growing marketplace for trafficking rare and endangered wildlife products as souvenirs. Just say no.",
"Download design history at the Design Museum; the “Designer Maker User” exhibit displays hundreds of items spanning various disciplines, from fashion to architecture, Vespas to robots.Journeys that spark the imagination can lead to revolutions in creativity. In 1966 a young Yves Saint Laurent discovered the beauty and colors of Marrakech, and became so enamored of the city that he made it his second home. Now, a half century later, the French designer’s Moroccan residence is showcasing his eclectic sensibility, with couture sketches, fabric swatches, and interiors inspired by the city’s vivid palette.The Yves Saint Laurent Museum is one of several museums to debut in 2017. Each suggests that exhibits of the future will be as much about the experience of an object as about the object itself, pushing museums to expand in size and re-envision displays to engage, educate, and inspire visitors.Here are 15 genre-shifting museums, from Seattle to South Africa, that are receiving attention for their daring designs and interactive offerings.",
"Habitat loss, overtourism, and the consequences of climate change have put more and more travel destinations at peril, even as the pandemic’s forced shutdowns gave once tourist-trampled places a breather.This prompted us to ask our newsletter subscribers and Facebook followers the question: “Should there be places on Earth that are closed off to visitation? Should the wilderness be restricted in some way?”Responses swamped our inbox, with most making arguments for limiting tourism. “The last few decades have taught us so much about what happens to wild places when people trample them,” wrote Margaret Cervarich, pointing to the trash pileup at Everest base camp.“Many pristine and protected areas should be off-limits to humans completely, in my opinion. And a carefully evaluated few should be allowed for scientific studies,” wrote Charlisa Cato. Several, including Alper Takci, felt the limitations need to go further: “We should seal the whole planet off to humans.”Indeed, some places have closed to travelers temporarily, including Iceland’s Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon—made viral in a Justin Bieber video. Maya Bay, in Thailand’s Phi Phi archipelago, was overrun and its coral destroyed following the 2000 movie The Beach with Leonardo di Caprio. The beach, which has been closed since 2018, may soon reopen under stricter conditions. Other destinations have banned specific activities: In Hawaii, a new law goes into effect on October 28 prohibiting swimming with spinner dolphins.We put the same question to the experts. Most agreed that locking places away from people is not the answer. “I am opposed to the idea that you would, at face value, ban tourism to fragile places,” says Jeremy Sampson, of the UK-based Travel Foundation, a nonprofit working to improve the tourism industry. “The fact is that certain kinds of tourism can help protect natural resources or preserve heritage.”There are many cases where interventions have helped to mitigate overcrowding. Last July, Italy banned large cruise ships from entering Venice’s waters and declared the city’s lagoon a national monument. Bhutan has for decades pursued a “high-value, low-volume” strategy, with prices only luxury travelers can afford, while investing in the preservation of nature and culture. Some destinations—including Amsterdam—have all but stopped actively marketing the city to tourists, switching objectives from “destination promotion” to “destination management” for the welfare of locals.“We have many examples of visitor management systems that work to limit visitation in vulnerable places,” says Greg Klassen, a tourism strategist based in Vancouver. “For example, many national parks have areas open to visitors by first-come, first-served, lottery systems.”Such measures have been gaining traction. In 2017, Peru limited access to Machu Picchu to two timed entries each day and restricted travelers to specific trails. Some of the new, stricter pandemic-era restrictions—visitors having to buy tickets for specific hours rather than half-day blocks, for example—will likely be permanent. In the U.S., Rocky Mountain and Yosemite National Parks recently introduced a timed-entry permit system to manage pandemic crowds. While temporary, they point to potential strategies for reducing congestion in the future.(Can overtourism be made sustainable?)Timed entry and lottery systems were also suggested by reader Wayne Woodman, who wrote, “I think a lot of our wilderness and national parks are being overwhelmed and need to be restricted. So yes. I would favor stringent controls with access based on a lottery basis so as not to restrict those less fortunate.”Yet, lines and lotteries won’t solve everything. “It’s not just about the math. People always want to introduce a carrying capacity, and I think it’s just too simplistic. There could be other more nuanced solutions,” says Sampson. One idea is to make visitors promise to behave better. In recent years, destinations such as Iceland, New Zealand, Haida Gwaii, and the island of Hawaii have asked tourists to sign visitor pledges on or before arrival. The wording varies, but most ask visitors to tread lightly, protect nature, and respect the culture.“Most visitors to Palau were not aware of what constituted reasonable behavior,” notes Klassen, who helped develop the Pacific country’s pledge. “A marine protected area covers the entire archipelago, yet visitors were taking home coral from the reefs, leaving debris and garbage behind, and in some cases behaving badly.”The pledge outlines what visitors should and shouldn’t do (“Don’t collect marine life souvenirs. Do learn about the culture and people,” and unlike others, this one is enforced with fines of up to $1 million. “Even in places where they are voluntary, pledges still provide a level of education and commitment—even modest changes to visitor behavior can be helpful,” adds Klassen.In some places, particularly in Africa, strictly controlled tourism is key to wildlife conservation, and its income is vital to residents who might otherwise resort to extractive industries to survive.“In Rwanda, high-value tourism permits generate over $18 million per year, contributing to the repopulation of gorillas from a mere 254 in 1981 to 600 in 2019,” notes Tiffany Misrahi, vice-president of policy and research for the World Travel and Tourism Council.Tourism is therefore crucial to the preservation of these wild places. “If these forgotten forests in the heart of Africa are not connected to the people of the world,” says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris, which for 25 years has been bringing limited numbers of guests to Uganda and Rwanda to view mountain gorillas and chimpanzees, “there’s a very big danger that they could disappear altogether.”Often left out of the conversation are the world’s Indigenous peoples— the ones who have kept the planet in balance for millennia.“You can take a map of the environmental hotspots around the world and lay over it a second map of culturally endangered places, where indigenous peoples and their languages and traditions are struggling to survive. They are almost identical,” says Elizabeth Kapu’uwailani Lindsey, a Polynesian filmmaker, anthropologist, and National Geographic Explorer.(Skip the crowds and visit these hidden gems instead.)“So when we talk about place, we must also talk about people. We need the wisdom of those who have stewarded the land for thousands of years. We need to learn from them and nurture our own interconnectedness with the natural world.”In Canada, on the coastal fjords of British Columbia, within the Great Bear Rainforest, lies a swath of land the size of Ireland that protects thousand-year-old trees and the rarest bear in the world. Within it, Spirit Bear Lodge—owned and operated by the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation—welcomes visitors from all over the world whose dollars revitalize local communities and fund further conservation, including a successful effort to stop bear hunts.“The elders always say, ‘What we have here is not ours, we’re just holding it for the next generations,’ and that’s really important in everything we do,” says Douglas Neasloss, chief councilor of the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation. “The community has made clear it’s not just about money but about the future. We’ve been able to revitalize our culture and create a sustainable business model where we’re not pulling out a fish or cutting down a tree.”To help connect social and conservation enterprises to travelers who might otherwise converge on the same fragile sites, the country of Jordan, along with the nonprofit Tourism Cares, created a “meaningful travel map” of the country. It pinpoints 12 experiences that tread lightly, disperse travelers, and have a big community impact. The program has been so successful that a similar map is planned for Colombia.Closing off places to visitors should perhaps be left as the last resort, and some respondents to our original question agreed. “In order for endangered places to be preserved, there must be a minimum number of people allowed to wonder at and be fascinated by them,” wrote Ebrahim Hamad. “People will not protect what they do not know.”Another idea: Build a destination from the ground up. Rising up in Saudi Arabia’s coastal desert on the Red Sea, in an area the size of Belgium, is a city-to-be called Neom. Plans call for the preservation of 95 percent of nature, “with zero cars, zero streets, and zero carbon emissions.”“It’s one of the first destinations in the world entirely driven by regenerative tourism principles,” says Paul Marshall, Neom’s chief environment officer. The destination plans to use technology to transform the way people engage with nature and conservation, instead of channeling them into a visitors center.“We want to have an inside-out visitors center using technology such as AR/VR to project [an image] while people are outside in nature,” says Marshall. “This won’t be nature pretending to be in a building; this will be educational information projected onto the real landscape.”There are other technology applications. Just as Instagram and other social media contribute to the destruction of fragile places as copycats follow influencers to places “for the ‘gram,” some are using the same methods to reverse the damage.The Leave No Trace organization, along with destinations such as Jackson Hole, encourages travelers to use generic rather than specific geotags to reduce the chances of a specific site being overrun. And the virtual reality that kept travelers “traveling” to destinations during the pandemic could be easily deployed to ease the burden on fragile destinations. France’s famous Lascaux caves, closed since 1963, has been sharing the site’s remarkable prehistoric art through a replica cave, a high-tech traveling exhibition, and virtual tours on its website.“Achieving a future that allows access to places without harming them is no easy task. Individuals mean well... but have you ever found a group of people who absolutely agree on everything?” asks reader Barbara Cool. Perhaps not, but it’s crucial that we act.“The question we should really be asking is how can travel be used as a tool to solve these global problems? Because it can,” says Sampson.HOW YOU CAN HELPWhile on-the-go, keep in mind these ways to travel sustainably. Avoid traveling to overtouristed places when you can. Mitigate crowding at fragile areas when you use social media. The Leave No Trace organization, along with some destinations, encourage travelers to use generic rather than specific geotags to reduce the chances of a specific site being overrun. If traveling to destinations such as Iceland, New Zealand, Haida Gwaii, and the island of Hawaii be sure to sign and adhere to visitor pledges to tread lightly, protect nature, and respect culture.Norie Quintos writes and blogs about the world of travel from a cultural perspective.

"Patrons dine on a terrace along the Egelantiersgracht canal in Amsterdam.Hop on your rental bicycle to explore the Old Masters, cutting-edge cafés, and picture-perfect canals of Amsterdam.Founded in 1638, originally as a medicinal herb garden, Hortus Botanicus is one of the world’s oldest botanic gardens. This green oasis in the city has 4,000 plant species, such as wild orchids and huge palms, and one of the greenhouses is home to hundreds of tropical butterflies. The Orangery café is a charming place for a fixed-price three-course lunch.Visit a goat farm, munch on Dutch pancakes, enjoy an aromatherapy massage, go bird-watching, or attend an open-air pop concert. No need to choose—you can do all of these things, and more, at Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam Forest). The man-made forest was created between 1934 and 1964 and measures three times the size of New York City’s Central Park.The expansive dune landscape at Zuid-Kennemerland National Park, located between Haarlem and the North Sea, is home to fallow deer, roe deer, squirrels, hedgehogs, rabbits, foxes, Scottish Highland cows, European bison, and a hundred species of birds. The park is 30 minutes away from Amsterdam by train or bus.Sarcophagi and hieroglyphs from ancient Egypt, bronze and marble sculptures from Greece, and intricate mosaics from the Roman Empire are just some of the highlights from the collection at Allard Pierson Museum, which comprises 17,500 objects. The University of Amsterdam’s archeology museum is aptly housed in a former bank building.Amsterdam is not nicknamed the Venice of the North for nothing, with 165 canals running a total length of 47 miles. They can be explored via a sightseeing cruise, canal bike, or rental boat. To learn more about the history and purpose of the grachtengordel (Canal District), visit the Museum of the Canals.Famed for its acoustics and resident orchestra, the Koninklijk Concertgebouw (Royal Concert Hall) was opened in 1888 and stages 800 concerts annually. Every Wednesday (except July/August), a free lunchtime concert in either the Recital Hall or Main Hall is followed by a guided tour in English (€10), which takes you behind the scenes.Popular day trips include Monnickendam, Marken, and Volendam. Lesser known but equally enticing is Waterland, or “rural Amsterdam,” with its typical Dutch landscape of meadows and dikes, hamlets with wooden houses and medieval churches, and sweeping views across the former Zuyderzee. Cycling from Durgerdam to Broek in Waterland will teleport you a few centuries back in time.The canal houses from the Golden Age take all the attention, but Amsterdam also has its own distinctive style of modernist architecture: the Amsterdamse School with its wildly imaginative sandcastle-like structures sculpted in red, brown, and yellow bricks. You will find them scattered across town, but the perfect place to start is Museum Het Schip.Suitably named Museumplein (Museum Square) offers three world-class museums. Gaze at Rembrandt’s “The Night Watch” and Vermeer’s “The Milkmaid” at the Rijksmuseum, admire “Sunflowers” and “The Potato Eaters” at the Van Gogh Museum, or head to the Stedelijk for Picassos and Pollocks. The newcomer is the private Moco Museum, featuring Warhol and Banksy. Get your tickets online and arrive early to avoid queues and crowds.The wartime story of a Jewish girl hiding behind a bookcase for more than two years is well known around the world. Although the rooms in the Secret Annex are diminutive, the Anne Frank House attracts 1.2 million visitors a year, making it Amsterdam’s most visited historic site.

"The sun rises over the ruins of Machu Picchu, evidence of the Inca Empire at the peak of its power.Nestled high in the slopes of the Andes, the ruins of Machu Picchu continue to reveal the mysteries of the Inca Empire. While the archaeological site draws scores of visitors to Peru annually, here are 10 lesser known secrets hidden beneath its layers of history.When the explorer Hiram Bingham III encountered Machu Picchu in 1911, he was looking for a different city, known as Vilcabamba. This was a hidden capital to which the Inca had escaped after the Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1532. Over time it became famous as the legendary Lost City of the Inca. Bingham spent most of his life arguing that Machu Picchu and Vilcabamba were one and the same, a theory that wasn’t proved wrong until after his death in 1956. (The real Vilcabamba is now believed to have been built in the jungle about 50 miles west of Machu Picchu.) Recent research has cast doubt on whether Machu Picchu had ever been forgotten at all. When Bingham arrived, three families of farmers were living at the site.The semicircular Temple of the Sun, constructed around a large boulder, offers commanding views of the Sacred Valley below. During the summer solstice, the sun shines through a temple window and aligns with both the boulder within and the tip of a nearby mountain peak.The stones in the most handsome buildings throughout the Inca Empire used no mortar. These stones were cut so precisely, and wedged so closely together, that a credit card cannot be inserted between them. Aside from the obvious aesthetic benefits of this building style, there are engineering advantages. Peru is a seismically unstable country—both Lima and Cusco have been leveled by earthquakes—and Machu Picchu itself was constructed atop two fault lines. When an earthquake occurs, the stones in an Inca building are said to “dance;” that is, they bounce through the tremors and then fall back into place. Without this building method, many of the best known buildings at Machu Picchu would have collapsed long ago.While the Inca are best remembered for their beautiful walls, their civil engineering projects were incredibly advanced as well. (Especially, as is often noted, for a culture that used no draft animals, iron tools, or wheels.) The site we see today had to be sculpted out of a notch between two small peaks by moving stone and earth to create a relatively flat space. The engineer Kenneth Wright has estimated that 60 percent of the construction done at Machu Picchu was underground. Much of that consists of deep building foundations and crushed rock used as drainage. (As anyone who’s visited in the wet season can tell you, Machu Picchu receives a lot of rain.)A trip to Machu Picchu is many things, but cheap is not one of them. Train tickets from Cusco can run more than a hundred dollars each, and entry fees range from $47 to $62 depending on which options you choose. In between, a round-trip bus trip up and down the 2,000-feet-high slope atop which the Inca ruins are located costs another $24. If you don’t mind a workout, however, you can walk up and down for free. The steep path roughly follows Hiram Bingham’s 1911 route and offers extraordinary views of the Machu Picchu Historical Sanctuary, which looks almost as it did in Bingham’s time. The climb is strenuous and takes about 90 minutes.For visitors conditioned to the explanatory signs at national parks, one of the strangest things about Machu Picchu is that the site provides virtually no information about the ruins. (This lack does have one advantage—the ruins remain uncluttered.) The excellent Museo de Sitio Manuel Chávez Ballón ($7 entry) fills in many of the blanks about how and why Machu Picchu was built (displays are in English and Spanish), and why the Inca chose such an extraordinary natural location for the citadel. First you have to find the museum, though. It’s inconveniently tucked at the end of a long dirt road near the base of Machu Picchu, about a 30-minute walk from the town of Aguas Calientes.The summit of Huayna Picchu, also known as Wayna Picchu, gives trekkers a bird's-eye view of Machu Picchu.Long before dawn, visitors eagerly queue up outside the bus depot in Aguas Calientes, hoping to be one of the first persons to enter the site. Why? Because only 400 people are permitted to climb Huayna Picchu daily (the small green peak, shaped like a rhino horn, that appears in the background of many photos of Machu Picchu.) Almost no one bothers to ascend the pinnacle that anchors the opposite end of the site, which is usually called Machu Picchu Mountain. At 1,640 feet it is twice as tall, and the views it offers of the area surrounding the ruins—especially the white Urubamba River winding around Machu Picchu like a coiled snake—are spectacular.Should you be one of the lucky early birds who snags a spot on the guest list to Huayna Picchu, don’t just climb the mountain, snap a few photos, and leave. Take the time to follow the hair-raising trail to the Temple of the Moon, located on the far side of Huayna Picchu. Here, a ceremonial shrine of sorts has been built into a cave lined with exquisite stonework and niches that were once probably used to hold mummies.Should you wander away from the central ruins at Machu Picchu, you’ll notice that occasionally side paths branch off into the thick foliage. Where do they go? Who knows. Because the cloud forest grows over quickly in the area surrounding Machu Picchu, there may be unknown trails and ruins yet to be found nearby. Several newly refurbished sets of terraces were made available to the public for the first time in 2011.From the moment Hiram Bingham staggered up to Machu Picchu in 1911, visitors have understood that the ruins’ natural setting is as important to the site as the buildings themselves. Recent research has shown that the site’s location, and the orientation of its most important structures, was strongly influenced by the location of nearby holy mountains, or apus. An arrow-shaped stone atop the peak of Huayna Picchu appears to point due south, directly through the famous Intihuatana Stone, to Mount Salcantay, one of the most revered apus in Inca cosmology. On important days of the Inca calendar, the sun can be seen to rise or set behind other significant peaks.A new theory proposed by the Italian archaeoastronomer Giulio Magli suggests that the journey to Machu Picchu from Cusco could have served a ceremonial purpose: echoing the celestial journey that, according to legend, the first Inca took when they departed the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca. Rather than simply following a more sensible path along the banks of the Urubamba River, the Inca built the impractical but visually stunning Inca Trail, which according to Magli, prepared pilgrims for entry into Machu Picchu. The final leg of the pilgrimage would have concluded with climbing the steps to the Intihuatana Stone, the highest spot in the main ruins.",
"The semicircular Temple of the Sun, constructed around a large boulder, offers commanding views of the Sacred Valley below. During the summer solstice, the sun shines through a temple window and aligns with both the boulder within and the tip of a nearby mountain peak.Site: Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu Location: Peru Year Designated: 1983 Category: Cultural Criteria: (i)(iii)(vii)(ix) Reason: Machu Picchu is one of the most important archaeological sites in the world.* * *Machu Picchu is tangible evidence of the urban Inca Empire at the peak of its power and achievement—a citadel of cut stone fit together without mortar so tightly that its cracks still can’t be penetrated by a knife blade.The complex of palaces and plazas, temples and homes may have been built as a ceremonial site, a military stronghold, or a retreat for ruling elites—its dramatic location is certainly well suited for any of those purposes. The ruins lie on a high ridge, surrounded on three sides by the windy, turbulent Urubamba River some 2,000 feet (610 meters) below.Scholars are still striving to uncover clues to the mysteries hidden here high in the eastern slopes of the Andes, covered with tropical forests of the upper Amazon Basin. Machu Picchu appears to lie at the center of a network of related sites and trails—and many landmarks both man-made and mountainous appear to align with astronomical events like the solstice sunset. The Inca had no written language, so they left no record of why they built the site or how they used it before it was abandoned in the early 16th century.Landscape engineering skills are in strong evidence at Machu Picchu. The site’s buildings, walls, terraces, and ramps reclaim the steep mountainous terrain and make the city blend naturally into the rock escarpments on which it is situated. The 700-plus terraces preserved soil, promoted agriculture, and served as part of an extensive water-distribution system that conserved water and limited erosion on the steep slopes.The Inca’s achievements and skills are all the more impressive in light of the knowledge they lacked. When Machu Picchu was built some 500 years ago the Inca had no iron, no steel, and no wheels. Their tremendous effort apparently benefited relatively few people—some experts maintain that fewer than a thousand individuals lived here.In 1911 a Peruvian guide led Yale professor Hiram Bingham up a steep mountainside and into the history books as the first Western scholar to lay eyes on the “lost city” of Machu Picchu. While indigenous peoples knew of the site, Peru’s Spanish conquerors never did—a fact which aided Machu Picchu’s isolation, and preservation, over the centuries.Today Machu Picchu is far from isolated. In fact it’s a must-see for any visitor to Peru and the draw that compels many to travel to that nation. Machu Picchu’s management challenge is preservation of the site while making it accessible to all those who hope to experience an incredible part of Inca history.On his first trip to the site Hiram Bingham walked for six days. Today many choose to follow in his footsteps by hiking to the ruins on the legendary Inca Trail. It’s an experience like no other, but one no longer necessary. Train trips from Cusco take only a few hours.Mountain archaeologist and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Johan Reinhard offered this tip on how to escape the crowds that typically fill the site by midday. “I traditionally climb to the top of a nearby peak with a pack lunch and wait till the crowds are gone,” he wrote in National Geographic Traveler.For the fit there is simply no substitute for traveling to Machu Picchu the way the Inca themselves did—on foot. Today the Inca Trail winds through the mountains and along the path of the ancient royal highway. More than 75,000 people make the trip each year and along the way experience some of the associated sites that were part of the Inca network in this area.It’s no longer possible to do the trek independently. Due to heavy use (and subsequent environmental impact) the trail has become heavily regulated. Visitors must sign up with an organized group to tackle either the classic four-day route or a recently added two-day option.",
"Years before Kodak released its panoramic camera, the company's founder gave explorer Hiram Bingham a specially outfitted version to take on his groundbreaking expedition to Peru.One hundred and six years ago today, while searching for a lost Incan capital, a 35-year-old American explorer named Hiram Bingham was led to a mountaintop in the Urubamba valley of Peru. The area he entered resembled a tropical rainforest, but soon he began to make out walls and buildings. The granite blocks "were beautifully fitted together in the most refined style of Inca architecture," he recalled two years later in an account for National Geographic. As the scale of the 400-year-old site unfolded, Bingham realized that "Machu Picchu might prove to be the largest and most important ruin discovered in South America since the days of the Spanish conquest."Before departing from the mountain and the unearthed ruins that would make him famous, Bingham spent four hours documenting Machu Picchu with a special Kodak camera. "Would anyone believe what I had found?" he later said. "Fortunately, in this land where accuracy of reporting what one has seen is not a prevailing characteristic of travelers, I had a good camera and the sun was shining."Bingham had acquired such a camera through a relationship he'd struck up with George Eastman, the creator of Kodak. The panoramic version of that camera wouldn't come out for a decade, but Eastman provided it, along with free equipment and film for his expeditions. In return, Bingham reported back on the ability of Kodak's film to withstand and be developed in tropical regions. The panoramas in the gallery above were likely taken on a Kodak 3A camera that had been specially retrofitted to take 120-degree panoramas, says National Geographic photo archivist Sara Manco.Bingham, of course, was not the first person to discover Machu Picchu. Peruvian farmers in the region had long known about and visited the mountaintop ruins. But he was likely the first to make a photographic record of the site. Believing that photographs were as valuable as taking research notes, he insisted that his expedition teammates learn how to shoot and develop film before each trip. On his next trip to Peru, in 1912, Bingham requested even more equipment—three special Kodak cameras, 3,500 negatives to shoot on, and at least 10 wooden tripods. These documented the excavation of ruins, sometimes including Bingham or his teammates to show scale.Another man of that era recognized the power of photography to legitimize and popularize science. National Geographic Editor Gilbert Grosvenor courted Bingham and the result was a lengthy account and 244 photographs of the 1911 Peru expedition published as a single-article issue in 1913. The images were also exhibited at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C. The Society later funded half of his second Peru expedition, and he and Grosvenor became friends. Early on, Grosvenor recognized the historic importance of Bingham's work and offered some advice to the headstrong explorer. In their correspondence, he told Bingham not to work too hard, insult the Peruvian government, and, most importantly, do "anything that will detract from the brilliance of your Machu Picchu discovery. This discovery will loom larger every successive year."Bingham's famous story "In the Wonderland of Peru" was published in our April 1913 issue.

"Surrounding peaks reflect in Rocky Mountain National Park’s Nymph Lake.Established: 1915Size: 265,461 acresAnnual Visitors: 4.4 millionVisitor Centers: Beavers Meadows and Kawuneeche (year-round); Fall River and Alpine (seasonal)Entrance Fee: $20 per vehicle, $10 per personnps.gov/romoIn the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park’s soaring peaks are wild rivers, placid alpine lakes, and an amazing array of flora and fauna. And you don’t even have to hike to see them, if you don’t want to.Trail Ridge Road, which follows a path that Native Americans used for thousands of years, meanders through forests, above the tree line, and over the Continental Divide; it's the longest continuous paved road in the United States and an efficient way to explore the park's topographical range. But while driving may offer magnificent scale, nothing captures detail like a hike. So here are a few of the park's star attractions that are accessible either by car or by foot.Walking a section of the Continental Divide Trail offers a taste of the 3,100-mile trail that wanders through Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico. Twenty-eight miles of the trail falls in Rocky Mountain, and there are shorter, family-friendly options that are easier to access.Lulu City is a ghost town that in late 1880 was home to a population of 500 and 10 working mines. The boom didn’t last long, and by 1886 Lulu City was abandoned. Now a doable six-mile hike gets you to the spooky remains of a dream gone bust: several dilapidated log cabins, a few foundations, and ghosts of miners past.The Milky Way glows in the black night skies over the Rockies in a way we can’t imagine if we live in towns or cities. During the summer months, park rangers at Rocky Mountain join forces with the darkness and volunteer astronomers to walk visitors through what exactly is going on overhead.Frosted with snow, Bear Lake gleams beneath distant Longs Peak and Keyboard of the Winds. The lake is one of the few high-mountain lakes in Colorado reachable on a paved road.The old frontier town of Estes Park has long been the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park. Art galleries and artisanal alcohol (breweries, distilleries, and wineries) are the twin pillars of the downtown scene. Opened in 1909, the Stanley Hotel (Stephen King’s inspiration for The Shining) offers guided history tours and evening ghost tours to guests and the general public.There’s also plenty of outdoor action. The bright red cars of the Estes Park Aerial Tramway sail to the summit of Prospect Mountain, where the view often extends 100 miles along the snowcapped Front Range. Strewn with sculptures and shady sitting spots, Estes Park Riverwalk meanders along the banks of two rivers that cut through town. The nonprofit Rocky Mountain Conservancy partners with the national park on a wide range of guided tours, seminars, and family activities like geocaching, fly-fishing, and art in the park.From Estes, two routes lead into the national park. Highway 36 shoots to Beaver Meadows Visitor Center with its information desk, natural history exhibits, and backcountry permit office; Highway 38 makes its way to Fall River Visitor Center and a similar set of services. The two roads converge at Deer Ridge Junction, the start of the 48-mile Trail Ridge Road. Owing to snow cover, the route is open only between Memorial Day and mid-October. Places to pause along the drive range from the Highest Point and the lofty Alpine Visitor Center—the nation’s highest continuous paved road—to the half-mile Tundra Communities hike and several sections of the strenuous Ute Trail across the rocky highlands.Trail Ridge Road eventually dips into the Kawuneeche Valley. Few visitors make their way this far, lending the region an end-of-the-earth feel. It is here that the Colorado River starts its 1,450-mile journey to the Gulf of California as streams tumbling down from the Never Summer Mountains. The Colorado River Trail heads 3.1 miles upstream past cliffs that often shelter herds of bighorn sheep. Farther south, Holzwarth Historic Site spins tales of a German immigrant family that homesteaded the valley in the 1860s.The park’s other legendary auto route, Old Fall River Road is an 11-mile, one-way climb from Horseshoe Park to Chapin Pass and the Alpine Visitor Center. Be forewarned: It’s mostly gravel and features numerous switchbacks. Along the way are the slot canyon that funnels the 25-foot Chasm Falls and views of 13,000-foot peaks within the Mummy Range.Known for broad meadows and alpine lakes, Rocky Mountain’s southeast sector is accessed via Bear Lake Road. The park’s largest open space, Moraine Park, is a favorite grazing place for elk and mule deer; an easy 5.5-mile trail loops around the entire meadow. Farther up the road are trailheads for Hollowell Park, Sprague Lake, Storm Pass, Glacier Gorge, and the shoreline path around handsome Bear Lake—hikes that vary from easy to strenuous depending on their length and elevation gain. Several of these trailheads are also jumping-off spots for ascents of 14,259-foot Longs Peak, the park’s highest mountain.The park’s Hidden Valley ski area (open 1955 to 1991) is permanently closed. But families still flock to the old slopes for sledding and tubing. And anyone willing to hike up the slopes can ski or snowboard back down (but must yield to sledders).• Arapaho & Roosevelt National Forests: Surrounding the national park, these Forest Service reserves are a hiking/climbing paradise including 10 wilderness areas, hundreds of trail miles, and some of the highest peaks in all the Rockies.• Golden Gate Canyon State Park: Iconic Rocky Mountain scenery and a gold rush legacy color this popular state reserve just west of Denver.• Eldorado Canyon State Park: Rather than gold metal, this deep indentation in the Rockies takes its name from the way the sun glistens off its 800-foot-high red-rock walls. The rugged park has more than 500 rock climbing routes.• Lory State Park: Twenty-five miles of hiking trails are the main attraction of a park that marks the transition between prairie and mountains near Fort Collins.• Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge: Set along the secluded Illinois River in north-central Colorado, the reserve features a 6-mile auto tour through habitat that nurtures moose, elk, beaver, otters, coyotes, pronghorn, and more than 200 bird species.",
"Rocky Mountain National Park is an ideal alpine playground, complete with sheer rock walls, steep couloirs, and craggy peaks—everything a budding climber needs to cut his or her teeth.Climbing is a surefire way to get intimate with the park. Searching for handholds on a granite slab, swinging an ice ax into a frozen flow, or kicking steps up a snowy slope, you transform from a mere observer to part of the landscape itself. And as a result, you can find deep inner tranquility.Take it from Enos A. Mills, the father of Rocky Mountain National Park: “Among the serene and steadfast scenes you will find the paths of peace and a repose that is sweeter than sleep.”Snow blankets the park’s higher elevations for much of the year, compressing the climbing season into a few months.The best time to go depends on what sort of terrain you seek. Hit the rocks from April to October, ice from December to March, and snow from May to July.Mixed climbing on rock and snow is best in May, June, November, and December.If you’ve never delved into alpine pursuits, take a class to learn the basics. Colorado Mountain School offers a full range of rock climbing, mountaineering, and ice climbing classes in the park, ranging from a day to a week in length.The key to climbing is to dress in warming layers. It can be mighty cold and windy at 12,000 feet. Choose synthetic fabrics or wool, which wick moisture away from your body and dry quickly, while avoiding cotton (which does quite the opposite) at all costs.Always bring warm gloves and a waterproof jacket and pants, regardless of the weather report. Storms roll in fast in the mountains, and can transform a bright sunny day into a freezing snow- or hailstorm, even at the height of summer.While you’re at it, slather on the sunscreen and don a hat and sunglasses, as the rays are more intense at high altitudes.> Gear: For technical climbing, you’ll need a harness, helmet, ropes, belay device, carabiners, and protective gear, which you can rent or your guide will provide.Specialized climbing shoes with sticky rubber soles are standard for rock climbing. If you’ll be on snow or ice, you’ll want sturdy boots, crampons, and an ice ax and/or tool. When rappelling, wear leather gloves to protect your hands from rope burn.> Altitude: Altitude can be debilitating. If you’re coming from sea level, wait a day or two before trying anything strenuous in order to give your body a chance to adapt to the change in elevation. And drink lots of water throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty. This is especially true when you get into the field.> Timing: Start early, and plan to get off any peak by 10:00 a.m. Thunderstorms build quickly, especially in the summertime. You don’t want to be above the tree line when lightning strikes.You could spend a lifetime exploring all of the nooks and crannies of Rocky Mountain National Park. Here are a few great spots to give climbing a shot:> Longs Peak: At 14,259 feet, Longs Peak is the park’s highest point and offers a great taste of mountaineering.The classic route—the Keyhole—is 15 miles round-trip and takes 10 to 15 hours. The route involves hiking and scrambling and crosses several exposed ledges, so bring a steady set of nerves and climb cautiously.The season for Longs is mid-July to mid-September.The YMCA of the Rockies offers a program where hike masters lead you on a succession of progressively more difficult hikes until you are ready to tackle Longs Peak. Colorado Mountain School offers guided trips up even more technical routes.> Lumpy Ridge: The bulbous slabs and cliffs here make for an excellent technical rock climbing experience.With everything from entry-level to expert climbs, Lumpy Ridge is also a great place for first-time climbers and those wishing to take their skills to the next level.Due to the ridge’s relatively low elevation, climbing season starts in April, before the rest of the park has thawed.On Fridays during the summer, Colorado Mountain School leads group climbs at Lumpy Ridge.> Dreamweaver: This classic couloir is a stout snow climb (with a couple of short ice sections) that’s challenging yet within reach for beginners.As you kick steps up the increasingly steep gully, your jaw will drop in awe at views of the Flying Buttress rock formation alongside you. The couloir tops out just below the summit of 13,911-foot Mount Meeker.If you’re heading out with Colorado Mountain School, you can stay in their lodge and enjoy an inexpensive climber vibe. Expect bunk rooms, shared bathrooms, ping-pong, and a communal kitchen. And don’t forget your earplugs.Surrounded on three sides by Rocky Mountain National Park, the YMCA of the Rockies has been around longer than the park (the YMCA held its first summer school in 1908, more than six years before the park was officially established). Sleeping options run the gamut from lodge rooms to family cabins to eight-bedroom houses for large groups. The 860-acre property and huge roster of activities make you feel like you’re a kid at camp.Staying at the Stanley Hotel is like stepping back in time. The stately Estes Park establishment, which opened in 1909, is on the National Register of Historic Places and is just six miles down the road from the park. Despite being the inspiration for Stephen King’s The Shining, it’s not really haunted—though it’s fun to ponder.> Grand Teton National Park (Wyoming, United States): Rising 7,000 feet from the valley floor, the Grand Tetons are a prime place to try climbing. Exum Mountain Guides will take you to a perfect rocky training ground near Hidden Falls and show you the ropes.> Yosemite National Park (California, United States): The towering walls of Half Dome and El Capitan make Yosemite climbing the stuff of legends. Yosemite Mountaineering School can teach you how to tackle the rocks.> Chamonix (France): Mountaineering heritage is woven into the soul of this charming town. Climbing options abound, from glacier trekking to the top of Mont Blanc—the highest peak in western Europe—to the Cosmiques Arête, a thrilling mixed route that finishes at the top of the Aiguille du Midi tram. Plenty of outfitters are on hand to guide you.Boulder-based freelance writer Avery Stonich has traveled to more than 40 countries in search of adventure.

"You don’t have to dig too deeply into a top news story these days to figure out the impact it might have on the traveling public. The Arab Spring and mall shootings in Nairobi are two obvious examples.Last weekend, I would witness the effect two recent front-page events are having on travel: The flooding in Colorado and the shutdown of the U.S. government.To mark our 20th wedding anniversary, my wife and I booked a trip to Estes Park, a popular summer resort town on the outskirts of Rocky Mountain National Park, to get away for a long weekend — and to check out Elk Fest, an annual celebration that coincides with the advent of fall or, more specifically, the elk rut — i.e. mating season.Two weeks before our scheduled flight, we watched in shock as unrelenting torrential rains devastated the area. I was convinced we’d be forced to change our plans.Wrong. Elk Fest was still on!What would normally be a 90-minute drive from downtown Denver to Estes Park is now almost three hours thanks to a washed out Route 34 that leads to town from the east. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the alternate route takes you through Peak To Peak Highway, one of America’s most scenic and historic byways.We certainly didn’t mind taking a detour surrounded by shimmering golden fall foliage and snow-covered peaks, but apparently the locals do. What’s normally one of the busiest weekends of the year in this mountain village was now one of the slowest.The month of September had been anything but normal around here. Just 30 miles to the south, we passed the exit for Jamestown, which just days before required the largest human airlift since Katrina in 2005. Luckily, the road leading to Estes Park had been cleared of rockslides and the streets of downtown, once caked with several inches of mud, had been power washed.This was a town seriously determined to return to business, and we were more than happy to support their efforts.The lobby of Estes Park’s landmark Stanley Hotel was buzzing with activity as we checked in. Locals from around the region were gathering for a chance to let off some steam.  “Mountain Strong” proclaimed the t-shirts and bumper stickers being sold to raise money for displaced residents.Despite the raging party, we managed to take the 90-minute ghost tour the hotel offers nightly. Along with its rich history (Stephen King based The Shining on his stay here), the Stanley has become a well-known hotspot for paranormal activity. Even if you’re a non-believer, the tour was a great way to learn about the property’s illustrious past.But we were here to see elk, not ghosts. The two-day Elk Fest, which admittedly wasn’t at full strength this year, included wildlife exhibits, street vendors, a bugling competition (bugling is what male elks do to attract the females), educational seminars, and Native American dancing and storytelling.Sure, everyone seemed to have fun, especially the kids, but the main attraction is seeing the elk in action. (It’s rare to actually see the elk mating, so no worries there. You will, however, have to explain what it means when animals are in heat means … and why males make such a big deal over the ladies.)Our host at the Golden Leaf Inn, a newly opened and quite charming little guesthouse just outside of town, suggested we pick up a packed meal from Picnic In the Park before taking off. So we followed her lead and arrived just in time for the evening “Elk Echoes” program led by a park ranger.Because of the small crowds and unseasonably cool weather, the large tailgating parties that typically gather to witness the elk’s unusual courting rituals didn’t materialize. Instead, the few of us who were there were treated to quite a display of bull elks aggressively guarding their harems. Some even waged violent battles to fend off unwelcome suitors.After our visit, reports of the government shutdown began dominating the news, along with word that the country’s national parks would remain closed until the situation was resolved.That may be good news for the elk, gaining them some privacy, but for Estes Park, a community that relies so heavily on tourism to fuel its economy, this is just more salt in a wound that’s ready to heal.Rainer Jenss is a featured contributor for Intelligent Travel.

"Don't bring home netsuke—traditional kimono ornaments often carved from ivory—from a trip to Japan.The thrill of discovery propels our journeys, but sometimes curiosity can kill the cat—literally. In the Akodessewa Fetish Market of Lomé, the capital city of Togo, travelers can find piles of animal parts and pelts, including those from cheetahs and other big cats. While these are not intended as souvenirs—the market functions as a source for ritualistic fetishes and charms—it’s easy to see that the wildlife trade is active around the globe. Last year, a man was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for carrying nearly a hundred dead hummingbirds—often sold as love charms—in his suitcase. (Here are more bizarre items that TSA finds in airports.)Travelers can play an important part in conservation efforts. While you probably know bringing live animals home is a bad idea, it can be easy to risk harming wildlife without realizing it. To add to our original list—which includes snake wine and bird feathers—here are nine more wildlife souvenirs to avoid.There are more than 40 different species of seahorses, and many of them are endangered or vulnerable. Nonetheless, an estimated 150 million seahorses are captured and left in the sun to dry every year, later to be used in traditional medicine or sold as curios and souvenirs. Hundreds of thousands more are sold live for the aquarium trade. You can bring them home in limited quantities, but you may need a permit. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommends checking with the proper authorities in the country you’re visiting before coming home. (Follow these guidelines for ethical animal encounters on your vacation.)Purchasing souvenirs abroad made from animal skin to bring home to the U.S. is often ill-advised—whether they’re handbags made from crocodile leather or a coat lined with tiger fur. Here are just a handful of the many animals whose pelts could get you in trouble: lizards, snakes, seals, polar bears, otters, tigers—and the list goes on. Reptile leather products (boots, belts, shoes, etc.) are commonly seized souvenirs, and countries like South Africa, the Philippines, and China require export permits. If in doubt, the Fish and Wildlife Service says it’s probably not worth the risk.The purchase of genuine handicrafts made by Alaska natives using polar bear and otter fur is legal. For more information on how to tell whether it's authentic, check out the FTC's guide for buying Alaska native art.More than 350 species of rosewood, often used to make guitars, flutes and clarinets, are protected. The illegal rosewood trade in Africa and Asia is threatening the existence of this timber, which accounts for more than a third of seized wildlife products. As of last year, international sales of rosewood require permits. (Discover music around the world.)Marketed as supernatural tokens to help you snag a man and keep him loyal, dead hummingbirds (or chuparosas) can be found in Mexican markets for less than three dollars. Vendors can also be found across the border in Southern California and Texas. Purchasing, selling or possessing the birds without proper documentation is a crime.When returning to the United States, you’ll have to leave cacti and other plants—like your orchids and palm fronds—behind. The U.S. Department of Agriculture bans some agricultural products, which can bring back pests and diseases. Check their website to see what’s allowed.It might be tempting to pick these up on your island getaway, but many countries limit the export of these items. Because of overharvesting, certain corals are listed as an endangered species, and much of the seashell industry is illegal because the shells are collected with live animals still inside. Do your research on the country’s laws before you buy.Almost all species of sea turtle are endangered, and the trade of their eggs, meat, and shells is illegal. Watch out for products such as jewelry, hair clips, musical instruments, turtle leather products, and anything labeled “tortoiseshell,” and when you stop for a snack, avoid sea turtle soup and eggs.These shawls made from the wool of Tibetan antelopes, also called chiru, are illegal in the United States because obtaining the wool means killing several of the endangered animals. In 2018, Martha Stewart took heat for saying she never traveled without one during an interview with The New York Times. She quickly clarified that she meant “shahtoosh-like” and that her scarf was actually made of cashmere. (Read more about the demand for these $20,000 scarves.)While not technically a souvenir or a crime, taking selfies with animals can be cruel behind the scenes. At wildlife tourist attractions, animals like sloths and anacondas are often beaten into submission before photos are snapped, and the critters are usually captured as babies and held in inhumane conditions. But not all selfies are bad! Get those Instagram likes with photos of wildlife in their natural habitat—and avoid human contact or restraining animals.

"Leer en español.There’s a witch in San Diego who casts spells to “trap a man” and “dominate him” so “he’ll always come back.” She has a shop on San Ysidro Boulevard, one mile from the busiest Mexico border crossing in the United States, near a pawnshop, a liquor store, a furniture market, and the Smokenjoy Hookah Lounge, where DJ music thumps on Friday nights.But you don’t need to go to her shop for magic—you can join the tens of thousands watching her on YouTube. Like a wicked Martha Stewart creating potions instead of potpourri, she provides step-by-step instructions for her spells.Black-chinned hummingbirds are widespread in the western U.S., from lowland deserts to mountain forests and urban areas with tall trees and flowering shrubs and vines. They mainly winter in western Mexico.Rufous hummingbirds are famous for aggressively defending their territories from intruders and making long, arduous migrations—3,500 miles in the case of one record-setting bird.Hummingbird species occurring in the U.S. have been strictly protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The international trade of all hummingbirds is illegal without permits under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.“This is the honey jar,” she tells viewers while introducing the ingredients on her workbench: photographs of two would-be lovers, a piece of paper with their names written on it three times, a small glass jar—and a dead hummingbird. She rolls the tiny animal inside the photographs and wraps the cigar-shaped bundle with hot-pink yarn nearly the same shade as her long, fake fingernails.Showing only her arms and lower body on camera, she shields her identity as she swaddles the package in a sarcophagus of tacky flypaper, dips it in cinnamon spice, squeezes it into the jar, and spritzes it with perfumes and oils—pheromones—“so he’ll stay sexually attracted.” Restless balm “so he’ll be like, ‘Oh my God, I need to call her.’” Sleep oil “so he’ll be like a zombie.” Attraction oil “so he’ll be like, ‘Goddamn, you so beautiful, you so fine.’” Dominating oil “so you dominate his thoughts.”Finally she fills the jar with a thick pour of golden honey and tops it with a sprinkle of rose petals. “I love this,” she says. “I’m already getting a really good vibe.”As an entrepreneurial saleswoman, she tells viewers that any hard-to-find ingredients used in her creations are available for customers. For example, on her website a dead hummingbird—in life a feisty little iridescent green creature with rust-colored tail feathers—is $50. Buying a ready-made honey jar is another option. In an email she quoted me $500.Had I typed in my credit card number, I’d have been committing a felony. Multiple federal and international wildlife laws protect hummingbirds and most other feathered animals from being bought and sold. Even possessing undocumented birds is a serious crime. Last May a California man on a flight from Vietnam got caught at Los Angeles International Airport with nearly a hundred “good luck” songbirds in his suitcase. He was sentenced to six months' home detention followed by a year in prison.YouTube voodoo starring dead hummingbirds isn’t just some weird internet thing—it’s a peek inside the dark world of a mysterious international trade that may pose a serious threat to a group of animals already facing declines from habitat loss and climate change.Some Mexicans believe hummingbirds have supernatural powers. Beyond the internet, merchants sell them from behind counters at spiritual shops called botanicas, filled with herbs, incense, candles, oils, and scythe-wielding statues of Santa Muerte, the goddess of death. Mystics call the hummingbird la chuparosa, a token akin to a lucky rabbit’s foot for good fortune in love. Chuparosas are often sold wrapped in red paper and satin tassels with an accompanying love prayer: “Divine hummingbird ... with your holy power I ask that you enrich my life and love so that my lover will want only me.”At Mexico City’s Sonora Market a vendor misrepresents red-legged honeycreepers, in the the lit area of the cage, as hummingbirds. The ruse plays on the Mexican belief that a heart freshly plucked from a hummingbird and eaten boiled in soup or tea is the most powerful treatment for cardiac illness and epileptic seizures.The underground market for hummingbirds is so secretive that U.S. government officials didn’t even know it existed until about 10 years ago when agents with the Fish and Wildlife Service intercepted a postal package inbound from Mexico containing dozens of lifeless, jewel-colored birds.“We were like … hummingbirds? What do people do with a commercial quantity of dead hummingbirds?” recounted Special Agent James Markley, who has led investigations into the hummingbird trade. He soon learned about the love connection. “Women trying to attract a man, widowers hoping to remarry, men carrying them as a way to keep their mistresses and wives from meeting each other, a wife trying to prevent her husband from straying and looking at other women,” he said. "We’ve heard all sorts of stories.”Hummingbirds have played important roles in Latin American cultures, religions, and mythology. The Inca used hummingbird feathers in their fine garments, ritual sacrifices, and even architecture. On the Isla del Sol in Lake Titicaca, south of Cusco, in Peru, an entrance to an important Inca shrine was covered in hummingbird feathers.In Aztec mythology the hummingbird represents the powerful sun god Huitzilopochtli, conceived by his mother after she clutched to her breasts a ball of hummingbird feathers—the soul of a warrior—that fell from the sky. Mexican elders say Huitzilopochtli guided the Aztec’s long migration to the Valley of Mexico, and thus the hummingbird is the symbol of strength in life’s struggle to elevate consciousness—to follow your dreams.These days, in addition to being powerful love tokens, hummingbirds are considered messengers from the heavens and “road openers” for travelers. Markley recently met a former narcotics detective who encountered dead hummingbirds in shrines used by the drug cartels to pray to the patron saints for safe passage, good luck, and protection from the police.Federal agents posing as customers usually find hummingbirds for sale at botanicas in little plastic bags containing a satin-wrapped bird and a love prayer. Average price: $45. Texas has been a hot spot. In 2013 a man named Carlos Delgado Rodríguez, who owned a botanica in Dallas, offered the undercover Markley a wholesale discount: 35 chuparosas for $770.The white-eared hummingbird has a metallic-turquoise throat. It ranges throughout Mexico and Central America and occasionally visits southern Arizona. This bird is one of hundreds of hummingbirds involved in the chuparosa trade that are now held in the Fish and Wildlife Service's forensic laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.In the months that followed, Delgado continued making deals, selling Markley more than a hundred hummingbirds. The agency was able to identify at least 60 of them representing 10 different species, including several in steep decline.In May 2014, after the last day Delgado met Markley to swap bird cadavers for cash, he was arrested, according to court documents. A five-count indictment charged him with violating the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates the global wildlife trade, as well as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the U.S. smuggling law known as the Lacey Act, and Texas state law. The judge in the case sentenced him to four years probation and $5,000 in fines.That punishment was light, Markley said, but the verdict was a victory because it had shut down a smuggler. “Think about it,” he said. “If these were elephants or bald eagles, and we bought that many from one person. It’s crazy.”Pepper Trail, with the Fish and Wildlife Service's lab in Oregon, is one of the world’s leading forensic ornithologists. Trail has identified more than 775 trafficked species­­, from penguins and cassowaries to hummingbirds and hornbills.A key component of the case was the analysis of the birds at the Fish and Wildlife Service’s forensic lab in Ashland, Oregon, where experts in pathology, morphology, and chemistry examine crime-scene evidence using high-powered microscopes and scientific instruments that can even distinguish an endangered tree from a splinter of wood.The lab’s Sherlock Holmes of bird crime is Pepper Trail, who has spent 20 years poring over feathers and bird carcasses to help ID avian victims in wildlife crimes. Trail, a nature lover and a poet with a furrowed brow and small eyeglasses that sit low on the bridge of his nose, is the first to admit that the job can be incredibly depressing.“Birders have life lists,” he said, when we first spoke, on the phone. He was referring to the way many birders tally the number of species they’ve seen in their lifetimes. “I also have a death list of all the bird species I’ve identified in casework. It’s over 775 species from all parts of the world—everything from penguins and cassowaries to hummingbirds. You’re always learning new things.”Cracking the case of the chuparosa has become especially important to him. “Hummingbirds are powerful animals,” Trail said. “We respond to their vitality, their pugnaciousness, and their beauty. There’s nobody who doesn’t love hummingbirds. To find that there was this whole exploitation going on that was completely unknown—to me it seems particularly sad.”No one knows the exact toll smuggling is having on wild hummingbird populations, but some experts are concerned because the demand for love charms appears to be significant and possibly growing.In 2009 researchers surveying Mexico City’s Sonora “witchcraft” market documented more than 650 dead hummingbirds for sale. Since then federal agents have bought chuparosas with “made in Mexico” stickers—a sign that there’s a commercial market. “Maybe there’s a factory, or at least a good-size shop, making them,” Markley said, adding that they’re “all being processed somewhere.”There are still many unanswered questions: How big is the trade? Where are the birds coming from? How are they being captured and killed? Are there a few major traffickers, or is the trade decentralized? How many buyers have a sincere belief in love magic or want the birds as novelties?“Many of the answers lie in Mexico,” Trail told me, “but Mexico is not part of our jurisdiction. It will be interesting to see what you find.” He paused. “Be careful down there.”Naturalists have long been in awe of hummingbirds. In the 1800s John James Audubon rhapsodized about some of the “fairy-like” birds he’d chronicled while painting North America’s birds. Writing to a friend, he described the ruff-necked hummingbird as a “breathing gem … of glowing fire, stretching out its gorgeous ruff, as if to emulate the sun itself in splendor.”Hummingbird colors sparkle, from the glimmering purple crown and iridescent yellow-green throat of the male magnificent hummingbird to the brilliantly scarlet collar of the male ruby-throated hummingbird. They’re famously adept fliers, capable of hovering up, down, forward, backward, sideways, even upside down.As a group, some 340 species—from as small as a bee to as large as a cardinal—are named for the high-pitched sound of their wings, whirring at up to 80 beats a second. With the fastest metabolism of any animal in nature, hummingbirds hardly ever stop eating, except when they’re sleeping, which they can do only because of their astonishing ability to dial down their inner thermostats and enter a state of torpor, like astronauts deep-sleeping on interstellar voyages in sci-fi movies.Each hummingbird species is defined largely by its adaptation for drawing sweet nectar from the types of plants it pollinates. At the extreme end of this spectrum, the sword-billed hummingbird’s saber-like black bill is longer than its body. The bird’s beak evolved to gather nectar from flowers with long tubular corollas, including a passionflower that is deeply reliant on the avian rapier for pollination. The sickle-billed hummingbird has a dramatically hooked bill for sucking sweet sustenance from a heliconia blossom while perched on the flower. Found only in Cuba, the itty-bitty bee hummingbird, the world’s smallest bird, weighing less than a dime, is adapted to drink nectar from flowers too small for any other hummer. But since flowers can’t provide all the fuel required to keep the bird aloft, it’s also deft at snatching mosquitoes mid-air.Hummingbirds may look dainty, but if they feel threatened, they’ll chase pets and people, and they’re tough enough to flourish in some of the planet’s harshest places, from the heights of the Andes and the lowlands of Central America to the arid deserts of U.S. Southwest and the chilly coastlines of Alaska. Some make epic migrations between their wintering and breeding grounds: One record-setting rufous hummingbird was tracked more than 3,500 miles from Tallahassee, Florida, to near Anchorage, Alaska.Claudia Isabel Rodríguez Flores gentles a hummingbird as she examines, weighs, measures, and bands it at La Cantera research site at the National Autonomous University of Mexico campus in Mexico City.At least 17 species of hummingbirds migrate between the U.S. and Mexico, where a small group of researchers spends several days each month monitoring both winter guests and year-round residents.Their study site, called La Cantera (the Quarry), is a lush oasis on the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s main campus, in the capital city. Buffered from the drone of the traffic and smog in North America’s most populous metropolis, the former rock quarry’s flowering shrubs and babbling creek are a haven for hummingbirds.Claudia Isabel Rodríguez Flores removes a captured hummingbird from a net at La Cantera. Each bird is examined and fitted with a leg band that allows researchers to track the bird’s movements over time.Researcher Carlos Alberto Soberanes González prepares to weigh a berylline hummingbird at La Cantera. Beryllines frequently gather in the tops of flowering trees and are the most common species banded at the site.A berylline hummingbird, caught in a mesh net used for bird migration research, is one of nine hummingbird species often seen at La Cantera.At dawn one February morning at the site, Claudia Rodríguez Flores huddled in a winter parka, trying to keep warm in the shade. An ornithology Ph.D. student from Bogotá, Colombia, Rodríguez smoothed her long dark hair away from her face and tugged on a pair of fingerless mittens.As she arranged a tidy work area on a plastic table with a towel and pliers specially designed for fitting hummingbirds’ pin-size legs with metal bracelets, she gave a primer on the research project, now in its seventh year. “We’re trying to monitor the hummingbird population,” she said. “We catch them with mist nets and band them so we can track their movements and try to understand the structure of the community.” Mist nets are typically made of black polyester mesh suspended like volleyball nets between metal poles. “So far,” she said, “we’ve caught 1,355 birds, about nine different species.”Heading down a cobblestone path, she pointed toward a shady brook where up to a dozen pixie-like hummingbirds were dipping in and out of the water for their morning baths. I watched in amazement, thinking about the rare treat of spotting just one hummingbird in my garden, a magical fleeting moment, like glimpsing a shooting star. Rodríguez carefully untangled a squawking hummingbird from a mist net. She put the bird into a cloth bag and tucked it inside her shirt to keep it warm.Back at the table she noted how healthy the bird looked. “He’s in great overall condition, probably just molted,” she said. “And he’s already banded, a recapture—we’ve caught him before.”She used a magnifying glass to read the code, MX8165, on the bird’s tiny anklet and fed him some sugar water through a dropper while taking measurements and dictating to a student who was recording the information. “Adult berylline hummingbird, male,” she said.The berylline, locally abundant and aggressive, is the most common species found at La Cantera. “They’re the chief of the feeders,” said Maria Del coro Arizmendi, who'd stopped by to see how things were going. They’ll bully and chase other hummingbirds trying to feed.The researchers use a variety of nets for catching hummingbirds at La Cantera. This one placed over a feeder is operated by a college student who pulls a string to drop the net if a bird arrives.Arizmendi, 55, fresh from an early morning workout, in leggings, a black fleece jacket, and purple running shoes with fluorescent orange laces, is the preeminent hummingbird expert in Mexico. She’s spent more than 30 years studying the birds and their threats. “Fifty-eight species are found in Mexico,” she said. “Thirteen are endangered, and five are threatened.”Endemic hummingbird species confined to niches of habitat are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards. The thumb-size short-crested coquette is found only in the forest edge along a roughly 15-mile stretch of road in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain in southern Mexico. Now a war zone for drug cartels, peasant guerrilla fighters, and government militias, the area is too dangerous for biological surveys, and as a result very little is currently known about the bird’s status. BirdLife International, a nonprofit conservation group, estimates that the coquette is likely declining by 10 to 20 percent a decade as forest habitat is replaced by coffee plantations and other crops, including opium poppies.Another threat: climate change. As global temperatures rise, the flowering periods of salvias and other important nectar plants for hummingbirds are shifting earlier in the season, becoming increasingly out of sync with the birds’ foraging demands. It’s a serious concern for migratory species that need to find food at pit stops along their routes. “They fly for a day, refuel, then fly for a few more days,” Arizmendi said. If the flowers continue the trend of blooming earlier and earlier, the hummingbirds will eventually go hungry.When I asked her about the threat that wildlife trafficking poses to the hummingbirds, she said, “Nobody has a measure, but if the trade for love is growing, we have to stop it now.” She’s concerned about the effects of indiscriminate collecting by poachers (“without any knowledge—females, juveniles, whatever they find”) on those populations of endemic species that are confined to small areas.By now the table was crowded with students and volunteers shuffling bird guidebooks, pencils, walkie-talkies, clipboards, and data sheets. Carlos Soberanes González, 38, who co-leads the fieldwork with Rodríguez, returned from a final net check. With the morning’s hummingbirds banded and released, it was time for Soberanes, Rodríguez, and me to go meet a Santero priest at a coffee shop near the center of the city.Cristóbal Carreño Parada, who practices the Yoruba religion, spends time at his family's shrine in Mexico City. In Yoruba beliefs the hummingbird is an important messenger between the saints and the terrestrial world. Hummingbirds, unlike pigeons and chickens, aren’t used in sacrificial ceremonies.I’d imagined a Santero might be an old guy wearing an ornate robe or something exotic, but Arturo Frausto Iwori Ogbe (“Nicho”), 25, came dressed in a black T-shirt, puffy green vest, tan pants, and black Nikes. At Starbucks, sipping a venti caramel macchiato, he prepped us for our visit to the market, where he buys supplies for religious ceremonies, including animal sacrifices. We would talk to some merchants selling dead hummingbirds, Nicho said. “But no pictures—unless I say it’s OK.” (I’d been forewarned that this was no place for tourists.)Nicho’s religion is Yoruba, named for one of Nigeria’s main ethnic groups, an African faith now commonly followed in Cuba, the Caribbean, Latin America, and some parts of the U.S. Traditional Yoruba beliefs hold that all people possess a destiny or fate and that eventually people become one spirit with a divine creator and source of all energy. The hummingbird plays an important role in this religion as a power force and as a messenger between the spiritual and physical realms.At the market, every second shop brimmed with dream catchers, voodoo dolls, candles, animal skulls, and Santa Muerte statues. Nicho took us straight to a “witch,” a stocky woman in a green camouflage apron and combat boots. She welcomed us into her shop, where skulls and feathers dangled from the ceiling. Stretching out her palm, she showed us four inert little hummingbirds.“It’s for amor,” she said—a love spell. “When you do an amor of this kind, be careful because, it’s a big deal. The force of a hummingbird is very strong in the mystique world.”Then she explained how she makes the spell. “We put them face-to-face [a male and a female bird], ideally with underwear from both a man and a woman. Then you put them in a small red bag, fill the bag with pure honey, and you place it in your shrine with candles. That’s the way we do it.”Vendors at Mexico City’s Sonora Market sell dead hummingbirds for about $2.50 each. For an extra fee some sellers will prepare the birds in small pouches filled with honey. Customers place the pouches in their personal shrines.Without the honey and other trappings, a hummingbird can be used as an amulet, she continued—“for good luck, or a road opener. If you have someone in your sights, you just write their name, wrap it toward you, and carry it around. Every day you put some of your perfume on it.”These birds, she explained, were from a guy in Pachuca, the capital city of the state of Hidalgo, north of Mexico City. “They throw nets up to the trees and catch them and preserve them in hydrogen peroxide,” she said. “That way they don’t fall apart, or lose their feathers.” A single bird costs 50 pesos (about $2.50), a tricked-out amor, 600 pesos. She makes about 20 of those a month, mostly for women. “Works 98 percent of the time,” she said. “Very powerful.”Deeper inside the market, Nicho stopped to say hello to other merchants who showed us their hummingbirds. In one area, where seemingly endless cages of puppies, rabbits, chickens, parrots, and a dead chinchilla lined the aisles, we met a guy displaying a handful of dead hummingbirds. He recommended them as a good treatment for epilepsy or heart problems.“You cut their heart out,” he said, “and boil it to make tea or soup.” One of the species in his hand was an amethyst-throated hummingbird, noticeably larger than the other species we’d seen. Recognizing our interest in the bird, he offered it for 150 pesos. To sweeten the pot, he’d toss in two free teeth that he said were crocodile.Almost every vendor we met had nearly a dozen hummingbirds dangling like charms on hooks, red thread stitched through their eyes and throats. Soberanes, who’d worked in pet shops and aquariums as a child and studied military macaws in Oaxaca’s Sabino Canyon in graduate school, touched them in disbelief. He whispered, “These are the birds we try to preserve. It’s very depressing.”At the Fish and Wildlife Service’s forensic lab in Oregon, Pepper Trail was stooped over a black countertop, poking at a petrified hummingbird with a scalpel. He’d found another clue in the chuparosa mystery: tiny orbs visible on a CT scan. Curious, he’d x-rayed some specimens collected during the Delgado case and was examining them now to see if there were any signs of how the birds had been killed, one of the mysteries bugging him.Removing his glasses, he pulled on a magnifying visor to get a better look at the birds. At first he found only a dried resin-like substance. He noticed that the birds’ breasts had been cut open but couldn’t find any metal inside them. The lab’s veterinary pathologist, Tabitha Viner, offered to take a look. Minutes later she extracted a dull-gray metal ball about the size of a pinhead from the bird’s chest.“It looks like lead,” Trail said. “Maybe some kind of shot?”Pepper Trail has identified nearly 20 species of hummingbird chuparosas sold packaged in plastic bags with adornments and love prayers.He scraped the fragment into an envelope and took it down the hall to his colleague, Pam McClure, an analyst in the chemistry lab. "Yes," she said, as the results showed on her computer screen. “It’s lead.” Comparing it to a chart of ammunition sizes, she surmised that it was size 11 (1.57 millimeters in diameter), probably something used in a small-gauge shotgun.Using a shotgun to bring down a hummingbird seems like chopping a salad with a machete. Yet more than a third of the birds Trail X-rayed recently contained lead shot. How they weren’t blown to smithereens is another mystery.Pedro Trinidad, who grew up in the mountains outside Mexico City and is now living in New Jersey, told me that as a six-year-old, he and his brothers killed hummingbirds with slingshots. It helped pass the time, he said, when they were minding the family cows. He regrets it now, but back then it was what boys did. “Rabbits, snakes—if it moved, we killed it. I could shoot two or three hummingbirds in a day. A man in a local shop would buy them. We’d be very happy because we had a couple of pesos to buy a Coca-Cola or a sweet.”It would take an army of kids with slingshots to supply the profusion of hummingbirds in Sonora Market and all the botanicas in Mexico and the U.S.“It comes down to supply and demand,” Trail said. “As long as the demand is strong, people will always try to meet it.”Stopping hummingbird smuggling will require law enforcement on both sides of the border, but Mexico hasn’t yet determined that there is indeed a hummingbird problem.Joel González Moreno heads the inspection and surveillance of wildlife, marine resources, and coastal ecosystems in the Federal Attorney’s Office for Environmental Protection. “We have not detected a critical trafficking situation for this group of species,” he wrote in an email. He cited habitat loss as the main concern but added that animal smugglers can face up to three years prison time. And if the smuggling is associated with organized crime, the punishment can be nearly 20 years in a Mexican jail.Chuparosas purchased at botanicas by undercover Fish and Wildlife Service agents are sent to the service’s forensic lab in Oregon—the only one in the world dedicated to crimes against wildlife. There the birds are identified by species and scrutinized for clues about where and how they were killed.Pepper Trail is trying to elevate the issue with Mexican officials. Each year Mexico joins the U.S. and Canada at a trilateral meeting to coordinate international conservation efforts. In preparation for the meeting on April 9, Trail submitted an update on the chuparosa trade.“Ongoing investigative work by the [Fish and Wildlife Service] Office of Law Enforcement indicates that this trade is significant and widespread, at least in the border states,” he wrote. “Continued efforts need to be made to gather information on the status of hummingbird populations in the U.S. and especially Mexico …. It may be appropriate to consider whether additional protections for hummingbirds under Mexican law are needed …. Additional collaborative work needs to be done involving both governmental and non-governmental organizations in the U.S. and Mexico to educate the public about the ecological importance of hummingbirds and to discourage killing hummingbirds for these love charms.”“I received an acknowledgement that it was received,” Trail said. “But there’s no one to push for it—I’m not a member of the delegation.”Humberto Berlanga, Mexico’s coordinator of the North American Bird Conservation Initiative, an international forum of government agencies and private organizations, is a member of the delegation. Berlanga doesn’t regard hummingbird trafficking as a high priority. “I suspect the market is not too big, and I don’t think it’s affecting any endangered species, but we don’t have the data,” he said. “Those are my general impressions. People are illegally catching and using the birds, but there’s not enough enforcement to limit and stop this practice—it’s sad, but true.”Lately a steady stream of new evidence has been arriving at the Fish and Wildlife Service’s lab in Oregon: a total of nearly 300 birds representing roughly 20 species so far. The birds are accompanied by at least five variations of love prayers. “They’re all printed differently, and the language is a little different,” Trail said. “My assumption is those presentations imply different producers. That tells us it’s not just one—it could be many.”Trail might never know—because he aims to get out of the detective business soon. On a bookshelf in his office sits a fat white binder labeled “Retirement Planning.” Last year the lab hired a forensic ornithologist who’ll eventually take his place. Trail is excited about having more time to lead birding tours, write prose, and gaze at living, breathing animals. But he’s not relinquishing the case of the chuparosa just yet.Rene Ebersole writes about science and the environment for many publications, including Popular Science, Outside, The Nation, and Audubon.

"U.S. airlines carried approximately 823 million passengers in 2016—an all-time high. But before a passenger can board a plane, each is required to undergo a rigorous inspection process carried out by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).TSA agents confiscate thousands of prohibited items per day from airports across the country, ranging from the bizarre to the disconcerting. These items, featured on TSA’s Instagram account, have garnered the attention of more than 700,000 followers and growing.“It almost looks like we’re in the entertainment business at times,” says Bob Burns, lead social media specialist with the TSA Office of Public Affairs and the man behind the account’s cheeky posts. After leaving his rock band in 2002, Burns originally joined TSA as a screener and later started the Instagram account in 2013—his idea to educate the public in a more engaging way.“Everyone’s had that teacher where you’re afraid to ask questions because you’ll get criticized or yelled at. The human tone of our Instagram account makes us more approachable,” Burns says. “The majority of our photos are prohibited items and strange things … we try to use that as a teaching moment: A chainsaw is not allowed in your carry-on bag.”Burns receives a weekly rundown of confiscated items that have generated incident reports—large knives, incendiaries, and guns among others—and selects photos from a never-ending goldmine of content. It also acts as a deterrent by showing potential offenders that these items will be found and taken, Burns says.But sometimes the TSA’s most-loved posts aren’t the prohibited items. “In Atlanta a passenger approached the checkpoint with a rotting corpse dummy that was a prop for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,” he recalls. “Imagine this person walking through the airport with this corpse in a wheelchair. Luckily enough it was able to fit through the X-ray.”Burns also fields a fair share of strange questions. “[One] that baffled me—I don’t know if they were being funny or they were being serious—they sent us a picture of a potato and asked if they could travel with their potato,” he recalls. “We said ‘Sure, bring your potato!’” In fact, passengers now have a direct line to TSA through more channels than ever, including their new AskTSA Twitter and Facebook Messenger accounts.In 2017, the account was nominated for two Webby Awards in the “humor” and “weird” social media categories—a testament to the internet’s love for TSA’s one-of-a-kind Instagram.Ultimately, Burns wants to make people smile amidst the stresses of travel and show passengers that TSA agents are just like them. “We are humans,” he says. “We’re not just nameless evil people on a Death Star.”",
"Snake wine, on display in Hanoi, Vietnam, is sometimes made by drowning a live snake in rice wine.Taking a vacation this summer? As a traveler, you have the power to contribute to conservation. Maybe you’re considering staying in a low-energy ecolodge or buying carbon offsets for your flight. Sustainable travel gets easier every year.Even travel companies are getting on board, making new pledges to stop wildlife trafficking. JetBlue will soon start showing a video onboard to passengers to educate them about the illegal wildlife trade, and cruise lines Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival have both pledged to educate their staff and passengers to eliminate the purchase of illegal wildlife products.Many of us already know that it’s illegal to bring home elephant ivory, rhino horn, and tiger products. But there are numerous other souvenirs that you might not realize are putting wildlife at risk.A good place to start is to ask these questions:And when you come across the following items, a red flag should go up.Sea turtle products: Did you know that six of the seven sea turtle species are endangered? It’s best to avoid sea turtle souvenirs altogether. That goes for jewelry, hair clips, musical instruments, sea turtle soup and eggs, sea turtle leather products, and anything labeled “tortoiseshell.”Snake wine: In Southeast Asia it’s not uncommon to find bottles of wine stuffed with whole snakes for sale. Some believe it has medicinal value (not true), and others like the oddity factor. But the truth is, it’s cruel and inhumane. Snake wine is often made by drowning a live snake in alcohol. It’s also potentially dangerous—every once in a while, the snake doesn’t die. It awakens from a drunken sleep to bite the person drinking the wine. Or it passes on deadly parasites.Coral and coral jewelry are popular souvenirs, but many countries restrict which species can be exported.Bird feathers: It’s tempting to bring home a brightly colored feather. After all, it’s lightweight and easy to carry. But be careful: The U.S. forbids bringing home feathers from most wild birds. The same is true for live birds, mounted birds, and birds’ nests.Coral and seashells: If you’re visiting coastal communities, there’s a good chance you’ll find people hawking dried coral and seashells in markets or by the side of the road. They’re easy to buy but not always easy to get home. Just like gems, certain corals are “precious”—they’re so exploited that they’re listed as endangered species. That’s why lots of countries limit what can be exported. Don’t get caught unaware at the airport. If you’re set on coral jewelry or bringing home that shell you found on the beach, research your host country’s laws first, and make sure you can ascertain with 100 percent certainty that what you’ve bought or found is what you think it is.Walrus ivory: Walrus ivory, unlike the souvenirs listed above, is more of a yellow flag than a red flag. Buying walrus tusk carvings or engravings (also known as scrimshaw) is legal—but only if the art was done by Alaska natives. The Federal Trade Commission suggests asking for written proof of authenticity if you’re not sure.For more information on how to tell whether it’s authentic, check out the FTC’s guide for buying Alaska native art. And for more information on what’s legal and what’s not, see the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s guide to walrus ivory do’s and don’ts.Want more information?

"Harvesting seashells for crafts and souvenirs is a large-scale industry that involves many species. These conch, triton, and helmet shells are for sale at a souvenir stand in Turks and Caicos.In the little coastal town of Kanyakumari, in southern India, mountains of newly harvested mollusk shells—living animals still inside them—lie drying out near a sun-drenched beach. Next up for these seashells: a dunking for a few hours in large vats of oil and acid to clean them. Any remaining flesh or scaly growth is then scraped off each shell by hand by one of hundreds of local workers, and they’re given another soaking in oil. After a final hand-polishing, many are shipped to artisans in nearby towns who craft jewelry and other mementos to sell to tourists. The remaining shells are destined for elsewhere in India and abroad.For many of the species found here, this industry is illegal under Indian law.Beyond that, says Amey Bansod, who witnessed the mass collection and processing of mollusks in Kanyakumari firsthand in 2014, it’s cruel because “the shells are very much alive.”Bansod was a graduate student when he visited Kanyakumari for his thesis project, which started as an inquiry into the livelihood of shell artisans and morphed into what he calls “a framework for a movement against the exploitation and mindless destruction of marine life.”These shells have been brought to a processing facility in India to be cleaned, dried, and shined.Bansod had expected to speak with a few artisans and learn about their craft but was flabbergasted by what he saw. A factory worker showed him around a processing center and a “massive open warehouse” with high gates and security. “As soon as we opened those tall gates, I could see truckloads—heap after heap of seashells everywhere as far as the eye could see—and that really put things into perspective for me,” he says. “That’s when the scale of this hit me in the face.”One worker told him that his facility processes anywhere from 30 to 100 tons of shells a month, and, Bansod says, several other such facilities exist in southern India. The dozens of shell species they handle range from the spider conch, a curved shell with long protrusions resembling spider legs, to the green turban, with its swirling emerald, white, and brown vertical layers. Both species are listed under India’s Wildlife Protection Act and therefore illegal to harvest in the country.According to Bansod, the shells are packaged by the kilogram and sold to craftsmen as raw material for souvenirs and other handicraft products. The supply chain varies from town to town. For example, shells may move from a factory in Kanyakumari to an artisan’s home or shop nearby. In the case of less touristy towns such as Rameshwaram, he says, larger processing factories send their shells to middlemen who sell them to artisans in places like Kanyakumari. Shells from Rameshwaram are also exported overseas or to larger Indian cities such as Vizag and Mumbai.At least 50,000 mollusk species inhabit the Earth. Whereas some shells are harvested for their meat, others—like the chambered nautilus, known for its beautiful, coiled multi-colored protective casings—are collected solely for decorative purposes.India is by no means the only major supplier. Local news reports from GMA News Online in the Philippines describe similar processes there for harvesting, cleaning, and distributing shells. Shells are also exploited commercially in Indonesia and throughout the Caribbean, among other places.Only a few species—notably the queen conch, which can grow to a foot in length, the chambered nautilus, the giant clam, and a few species of snails—are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the body that regulates the global wildlife trade.The chambered nautilus is a popular shell for jewelry and home décor, but unsustainable fishing has put it at risk. From 2005 through 2014, the U.S. alone imported more than 900,000.To trade these species, importers must obtain a permit from the country of origin, which is registered in an international database. In addition, CITES requires that source countries set fishing quotas to ensure that trade in these species is sustainable. Like India, a number of other countries have implemented their own policies to protect marine mollusks.Despite these measures, according to a 2016 study by Defenders of Wildlife, a U.S.-based nonprofit, mollusk shells are one of the most heavily confiscated wildlife products at U.S. ports of entry. Between 2005 and 2014, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents confiscated 77 different types of wildlife products, and shells, with more than half a million seized, appeared in the top five. Mollusk-derived shell products accounted for about 42 percent of all items. Failure to obtain an import permit—or attempting to import more items than allowed by a permit—is a common reason for confiscation.According to Alejandra Goyenechea, senior international counsel for Defenders of Wildlife, more than 90 percent of shell products seized by the Fish and Wildlife Service during that period were sourced from the wild, and nearly 99 percent were intended for commercial purposes. (The Service defines the import of eight or more items to be “commercial.”)Seashells at a facility in Kanyakumari, at the very southern tip of India, await processing. They’ll be sold to artisans by the kilogram.The queen conch—with its spiral, shiny pink and orange or cream shell that can measure up to foot long—is one of the most recognizable protected mollusks. According to a 2016 Defenders of Wildlife fact sheet, queen conches with no paperwork (or improper paperwork) accounted for more than 90 percent of all shells from Latin America that were confiscated by the Fish and Wildlife Service between 2005 and 2014. Undocumented trade on such a scale, Goyenechea says, has the potential to put wild populations in jeopardy.“There’s an impact on the environment—it’s not the same to bring two shells as 1,000 shells,” she says. When those myriad shells used for jewelry and decorative items like lamps and picture frames had living animals inside them in the ocean, they served a variety of ecological roles, including providing an anchorage for epiobonts like algae that provide food for marine life and for filter-feeding barnacles, which help clean the water. The queen conch plays an important role in its ecosystem by helping cleanse the Caribbean’s waters and providing food for animals like the loggerhead sea turtle and nurse shark. Not to mention that scientists consider mollusks to be excellent indicators of overall ecosystem health.Processed seashells at a warehouse in India are packed and ready to be sold. As many as 100 tons of seashells a month pass through some facilities.“Like any exploitation of the natural world, if you take out more from the environment than is sustainable, then that environment and the ecosystem collapse,” says Neil Garrick-Maidment, executive director of The Seahorse Trust, an England-based nonprofit that has been working to bring awareness about the ill effects of the marine curio trade since 2015.Amey Bansod says shell fishermen in India often use a fishing technique similar to bottom trawling, which involves dragging a large net along the seafloor. When this is done, according to the Oceana, “living habitat in its path is crushed, ripped up, or smothered as the seabed is turned over.” It’s unclear how widespread bottom trawling is in the global mollusk fishing industry.The chambered nautilus, native to the South Pacific, is probably the mollusk most affected by the shell trade. Little is known about this species, which was given CITES protection only as recently as 2017 and is especially vulnerable because unlike, say, giant clams, nautiluses can’t be bred in captivity to replenish diminishing wild populations.According to a 2016 study by TRAFFIC and the World Wildlife Fund, global trafficking in nautiluses is still rampant. The study notes that the illegal trade has shifted from shops openly displaying them to Internet sales, which are harder to monitor and control. The study also identifies the policing of the chambered nautilus trade in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia as a particular challenge.“CITES is only as strong as its member countries’ ability to enforce [its protections]” says U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Laury Parramore, adding that the Service works with foreign governments and other partners to build expertise, knowledge, and resources to properly implement CITES.In India, the Wildlife Protection Act aims to safeguard a handful of increasingly rare mollusk species, such as the scorpion conch and the trapezium horse conch. But, Amey Bansod says, enforcement is haphazard, and protected shells are sold openly on beaches to consumers and artisans, while others are exported across the globe. “Sadly,” he says, “lack of information makes it harder for officials to stop the trade in even the endangered shell varieties. This is compounded by the fact that port authorities don't really understand or acknowledge this as a problem. To them it's just raw material.”According to Goyenechea, identifying mollusk species is one of the toughest challenges in policing the international trade in seashells. During the customs process, importers often simply list their goods as “shells,” and the few inspectors at most ports of entry are expert enough to identify protected species.The 2016 TRAFFIC and World Wildlife Fund study, which focused on nautilus shells, backs up this assertion. It notes that in Europe, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, shells have the same species or genus customs codes as coral and other mollusks, crustaceans, and echinoderms and that monitoring the mollusk trade (in this case nautilus shells) isn’t a priority for authorities. “The absence of customs codes to track international trade, and the absence of market measures to ensure that the trade is legal mask the overall volume of harvest and trade that is occurring,” the report says.Bansod estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 people in the Kanyakumari region are involved in the shell business. He says he tried for years to attract investors to start a campaign that would educate communities about the damage done by the shell trade and would train local artisans to adopt an alternative craft—creating glass-blown “shells” instead of using mollusks. But no one stepped up, and his efforts languished.Garrick-Maidment says securing funding for less flashy wildlife species is “very difficult.” Mollusks and other marine curios like seahorses “don’t have the same appeal as elephants, tigers, and pandas,” he says, adding that as a result, it’s therefore hard to “get those in power to take notice.”  What’s crucially needed, Goyenechea and Bansod agree, is to reduce demand for decorative shells and other trinkets by spreading awareness among consumers of the dangers of overexploiting mollusks.And, Bansod says, this “goes beyond just one animal or one species. It’s just about being aware of what it takes for a natural resource to be pulled out from its habitat only to end up inside a living room”—especially if the exploitation is “based on unchecked and unethical practices just so you can buy an object from a shop.”Goyenechea suggests that people who want to buy shell products ask shop owners where they came from. If an item’s origin isn’t known, she urges not buying it.“I think that one of the most important things is people don’t have information about where the product is actually coming from and how it might be harming the species and the environment.” People may mistakenly think that someone just gathered shells lying on a beach, rather than that they’d been obtained as part of an industrial-scale enterprise.“Wildlife belongs in the wild,” she says, “not in our houses.”Tina Deines is a freelance journalist based in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
"Tibetan antelope are poached to make luxury wraps, called shahtooshes, from their soft, warm underfur. Four of the animals are killed to make a single shahtoosh—Persian for “king of wools.”Castasegna, SwitzerlandGiovanni Albertini is accustomed to opulence. At this checkpoint on the Switzerland-Italy border, a two-hour drive from Milan, he spends his days evaluating well-coiffed travelers and scouring their Gucci and Louis Vuitton luggage for contraband. He and his Swiss border patrol colleagues have assessed diamonds, pricey wines, and caviar, among other luxuries.But the drab scarf spread out before him now would not immediately impress. Wrinkled, beige, speckled with tiny, crinkly hairs, its only embellishment was a small fringe at each end. And yet this seemingly unremarkable wrap could be another valuable piece of contraband.Two hours earlier, Albertini had glimpsed it around the neck of a middle-aged Italian woman traveling with her husband in a silver Audi. The corporal pulled their car over because he suspected the shawl might be shahtoosh—the “king of wools” in Persian—a very expensive, ultrasoft, ultrawarm wool that is almost always illegal to import, trade, or even own.Shahtoosh comes from the short, warm fleece of the rare Tibetan antelope, a species found almost exclusively in the Changtang area of Tibet, on the Tibetan Plateau. It takes four animals to provide enough wool for just one shahtoosh shawl or scarf.Because the antelope are wild animals that can’t be domesticated and shorn, the only way to get the wool is to kill them and strip it from their carcasses. Smugglers then sneak the raw wool into India, where artisans in Kashmir weave it into neck-warming wraps.Global demand for shahtoosh wiped out 90 percent of the Tibetan antelope population during the previous century, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which sets the conservation status of wildlife species. Once a valued dowry item in India, shahtooshes are now sought primarily by Westerners, who may pay as much as $20,000 for a single shawl of the right size, color, and design.The origin of shahtoosh long was shrouded in rumor. One common myth was that it came from the down of a “Siberian goose.” Another was that the Tibetan antelope naturally shed its wool, and those hair clumps were then gathered up by nomads. Yet researchers have learned a lot about what goes into the shahtoosh trade, and they’ve seen the carnage from poaching.Conservation biologist George Schaller, who has studied the Tibetan antelope since the 1980s as part of his work for the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society, says the sight of Tibetan antelope in the wild is exhilarating. “The males are spectacularly beautiful with their long, thin horns and black and white winter coats,” he says, adding that when the tan females and their young start moving en masse, it looks as if an entire hill is in motion. The phenomenon is all the more stunning, he says, because it happens in such a wild, remote landscape. “You have thousands of square miles with no people at all.”On the move, a herd of Tibetan antelope raises the dust in China’s Qinghai Province.I first ran a shahtoosh through my fingers in a basement room tucked away in a residential neighborhood of Bern, Switzerland, surrounded by thousands—if not millions—of confiscated wildlife products. The locked room was located off a hallway that smelled like rotten cheese (government food-safety tests were under way nearby).In one corner, a display case held hundreds of shahtooshes of varying shapes and sizes. “This very small one is likely for a child,” explained Lisa Bradbury, pointing to an item about the size of a handkerchief. Bradbury advises the Swiss office that enforces the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Switzerland. (CITES is the international treaty that regulates cross-border trade of protected wildlife.)Most of the shahtooshes she showed me were quite large—about three feet by six feet. I wrapped one, an unadorned royal purple shawl, around my shoulders and took in its delicate weave and buttery softness. I could see why someone might want a shahtoosh—if you didn’t know about the animals killed for it.Global demand for shahtoosh wiped out 90 percent of the Tibetan antelope population during the previous century.Tibetan antelope once may have numbered about a million, but by the 1990s their numbers had fallen to 75,000. They began recovering in the first decade of this century, with stronger habitat protections in China and better enforcement of the animal’s strict CITES listing, which bars any international trade of the species.Even so, Swiss officials say they’ve been seeing a lot of shahtoosh lately. Between 2015 and 2018, customs officers seized the equivalent of more than 800 Tibetan antelope from the necks or luggage of travelers primarily from Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Middle East. Modern designs, including elaborate embroidery and patterns, suggest that at least some of the shahtooshes were newly made.The week before my February visit to the Castasegna checkpoint, Swiss customs discovered three more shahtooshes—the equivalent of 12 dead Tibetan antelope.“Shahtoosh is one of the main priorities for our office,” Mathias Lörtscher, the head of the team charged with enforcing CITES in Switzerland, told me when I met him in his office in Bern. And he doesn’t think his country is the only one with a shahtoosh problem—at two recent international CITES meetings, in 2016 and 2017, Switzerland called for immediate study of shahtoosh trafficking and increased vigilance around the world.Identifying shahtoosh requires a level of skill. Usually officials look for guard hairs, the long, crinkly hairs that keep Tibetan antelope dry in the wild. These hairs, unlike the antelope’s soft underfur, aren’t essential to a shahtoosh scarf’s characteristic texture, but often they’re both apparent and difficult for weavers to remove.When magnified, they look “kind of like a flagstone pattern,” says forensic morphologist Bonnie Yates, now retired and living in Oregon. In the mid-1990s, when she worked at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Forensic Laboratory, in Ashland, Oregon, she devised a way to distinguish the guard hairs of Tibetan antelope from those of other animals. Under the microscope, she found that a Tibetan antelope guard hair is filled with minuscule air bubbles that give it the flagstone look. A single guard hair from the domesticated Capra hircus goat—the animal used to make legal pashmina scarves—is entirely different, however. It’s a thick, dark strip with white edges, almost like a freshly paved street with pale gutters.At the Castasegna border checkpoint, Marco Zarucchi peered through a microscope at one of the guard hairs from the seized brown scarf Albertini had handed him. Zarucchi, once an Olympic skier and now a sergeant major at Swiss customs, has confiscated 19 shahtooshes during the past five years.After a few moments’ study, he and a colleague were confident that they had another. “Yes,” he told Albertini, “this is a shahtoosh.”It meant that the Swiss government would take the scarf, and the now former owner would eventually have to pay a fine as high as several thousand dollars.Zarucchi broke the news to the woman, whose identity I agreed not to reveal because of Swiss privacy law. He handed her an official government information sheet about shahtoosh. The Tibetan antelope, it explained, has the “same international level of protection as for example elephants, tigers and rhinos.”Without raising her voice or begging for her shawl, the woman offered Zarucchi an explanation: She’d inherited the scarf from a dear friend who died in December 2017. She had no idea it was shahtoosh—she’d never even heard of that word, she said.Zarucchi wouldn’t budge. This wasn’t just a Swiss restriction, he repeated. Shahtoosh is regulated under CITES.And so, two hours after the couple had pulled in to the checkpoint, they were permitted to enter Switzerland—carrying a receipt for the roughly $1,800 deposit they’d paid against the fine that would later be set by officials in Bern. The shahtoosh stayed behind in an evidence bag.Enforcement officers in Switzerland confiscate shahtooshes at locations including airports, border crossing checkpoints, and clothing stores.Lisa Bradbury has trained many of the Swiss customs officials whose task it is to identify and seize shahtoosh. After they make a positive identification, they must send the scarves to her and other officials at the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, in Bern, for confirmation testing. (About a week after Albertini’s seizure at the Italian border the team analyzed the brown shawl and certified that it was indeed a shahtoosh.)Shahtoosh was first listed for CITES protection in 1979, but that didn’t immediately send the trade underground. During the 1990s—the peak of the global trade—shahtooshes were still sometimes offered for sale in shops around the world and even openly advertised, according to various media reports. In 1994, $100,000 worth of shahtoosh shawls were also sold illegally at a U.S. charity auction to raise money for cancer patients—leading to the country’s first criminal prosecution for shahtoosh sales. (The shahtoosh smuggler, who brought in shawls worth about $250,000 in total, pleaded guilty to violating the Endangered Species Act as well as CITES, and a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey imposed a sentence of five years’ probation and a $5,000 fine.)As recently as October 2017, Martha Stewart told the New York Times that when she travels, “I always take a very comfortable shawl, a shahtoosh. They weigh almost nothing, and they’re as warm as a down comforter…it goes through a wedding ring.” (She was referring to the “ring test,” used to distinguish shahtoosh from thicker fabrics like pashmina.) Stewart later walked her statement back, saying that what she actually meant was that her shawl was shahtoosh-like. (Stewart’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.)Lately the U.S. shahtoosh trade has quieted, or perhaps gone unnoticed. I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency tasked with tracking wildlife trade, to seek details about any seizures of shahtooshes or other goods made from Tibetan antelope dating back to 2007. It returned no entries.A case holds confiscated shahtoosh in a basement room in Bern that serves as a warehouse for other illegal wildlife products, including fur coats, shoes, taxidermied animals, and elephant feet.When it comes to publicly acknowledged confiscations of shahtoosh, Switzerland tops the list. Within its borders, shahtooshes are often nabbed at a tiny airport a few miles from the posh ski resort town of St. Moritz. The day after the shahtoosh bust at the Castasegna border crossing, two dozen private jets were scheduled to land between late morning and mid-afternoon. Many were searched for shahtoosh and other illegal goods.Around 2 p.m., when three adults and four children disembarked from their flight, their bags were loaded into a small white shipping container to be searched. Zarucchi, the customs official, quickly found a suspicious-looking scarf buried beneath layers of carefully folded blouses and pants. It was navy green with an embroidered trim in orange, red, and pink. Initials, likely those of the weaver, were sewn in the corner of the soft, smooth fabric. To Zarucchi, the wrap looked and felt like a shahtoosh.The scarf’s owner—a petite British woman with sunglasses tucked into her hair, perfectly applied pink lipstick, and a toddler expertly angled on her hip—pursed her lips. “This is not a shahtoosh,” she declared, unbidden. She continued, “Everyone knows what a shahtoosh is. This is pashmina!” Her scarf, she added, doesn’t fit through a ring.Saying he’d have to do a secondary check with a microscope, Zarucchi took the scarf to a back room in the main customs building. He tried the ring test—using my wedding ring—and it passed through easily. But when he peered at the scarf under the microscope, he saw no guard hairs; this one wasn’t a shahtoosh. (The ring test is a good guide but not fail-safe.)Zarucchi brought the scarf back to the woman and told her that, yes, she was right—it’s not a shahtoosh. Of course not, she retorted. “I’ve seen shahtoosh on friends, so I know what it is.”Shahtoosh has become infamous in Switzerland. In 2003, the Swiss government received a tip from the CITES secretariat—the Zurich-based coordinating office for the 183 parties to the treaty—that a shop in St. Moritz had been selling hundreds of shahtooshes. The store, which kept meticulous records, had moved nearly 550 shahtoosh shawls during the previous decade. One wealthy Greek family had bought about 60 percent of the stock. (Swiss privacy law barred officials from telling me the name of the shop or giving further details about the case.)“These shawls arguably constituted the world’s most significant case of illegal trade in these products,” Heinrich Haller, director of the Swiss National Park (the country’s only national park), noted in his 2016 book about wildlife crime.More incidents followed. Swiss officials snatched 24 shawls from commercial shipments in Basel in 2010 and then eight more from a Swiss fair in 2013. That’s when they “realized this problem is not gone,” Bradbury says. And in 2016 in St. Moritz alone, 26 were seized from shops.Yet the main shahtoosh hauls in Switzerland continue to come from border patrol seizures. In 2014, 29 shawls were found in travelers’ bags. The next year it was 72, and in 2016, another 61. “If you look for them, you will find them,” Bradbury says.To help the Tibetan antelope population rebound, China has expanded Changtang National Nature Reserve, the protected area in and around which the animals calve. In 2015, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Chinese Academy of Sciences classified Tibetan antelope as “near threatened” in the country’s National Red List of Vertebrates. The next year, guided by that determination, the IUCN also downlisted the animal, from “endangered” to “near threatened,” and estimated that 100,000 to 150,000 remain in the wild.The tricky part in assessing how well Tibetan antelope are doing, says George Schaller, is that no full census of them has ever been done, so any population figures are rough estimates. The indomitable Schaller, who turns 86 in May, continues to make regular trips to the region. “In the areas I’ve seen,” he says, “they seem to be increasing, but it’s difficult to count them because they travel long distances. You can’t use an airplane like you can to census animals in East Africa because it’s China, and it’s a sensitive area. Most of the time I’m not allowed to even take another foreigner with me,” he says.Aimin Wang, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s China country director, notes that China’s government has said, informally, in recent meetings that Tibetan antelope now number 300,000—a fourfold increase over their estimated population during the 1990s. Wang says those numbers may be a bit optimistic and that the count is likely closer to 250,000. But, he adds, based on the Tibetan antelope’s improvements, the IUCN listing change seems to have been reasonable.Switzerland questions China’s numbers. “We’ve asked for the science, but we haven’t seen the population study—the population census—that allows us to say the population has strongly recovered,” Lörtscher said. In addition to being Switzerland’s CITES representative, Lörtscher is the chairman of the international CITES Animals Committee, which assesses trade and scientific data for CITES-listed animal species.“We need to see more to be convinced here in Switzerland,” he said. “I’ve told my Chinese counterpart this as well. They should talk about it and show it if they are really doing good stuff. I’m not saying it isn’t happening, but we’ve seen no data.” (Multiple requests for comment to Wu Zhongze, China’s CITES official charged with enforcing the international treaty, got no response.)Weaving shahtoosh has been illegal in India since the 1970s. A. Pragatheesh, an instructor in the wildlife crime bureau at India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, says the government is investigating how the wool is smuggled into the country, but because demand for shahtoosh comes from abroad, efforts are mainly focused on ramping up training programs for India’s border guard agencies.In 2018 alone, according to the ministry, 35 shahtooshes were confiscated in India—the highest number since 2011, when 55 were seized. (Schaller, based on his knowledge of the trade, believes the shahtoosh traffic is much larger than those numbers suggest.)To evade the authorities, Pragatheesh says, shahtoosh artisans have gone into hiding in Kashmir, and “it’s challenging to find them.” There’s great incentive to keep their work going. Switching to pashmina cuts weavers’ profits in half, according to a documentary by the Wildlife Trust of India, an India-based conservation nonprofit. Workers who clean the raw wool also depend on what they earn to support their families.But making shahtoosh isn’t just about the money, Pragatheesh says. Shahtoosh weavers were once highly respected, and the culture is entrenched. Each shahtoosh is painstakingly crafted, a process that can take years, and knowledge about how to work with the delicate, brittle wool is passed down through the generations.Unusual designs are a feature of modern shahtoosh, made by weavers in Kashmir and smuggled to markets in the West. Swiss officials call for international vigilance to help protect the rare Tibetan antelope.The industry is evolving, however, making law enforcement work even more challenging. To boost their profits and respond to changes in fashion, shahtoosh weavers often now mix in more pashmina, Pragatheesh says.As a result, the scarves can support more intricate designs and look and feel more like a pashmina. “If you make a shahtoosh shawl with just shahtoosh wool, it’s very light and fragile, so by mixing it with pashmina, you can do more embroidery,” Pragatheesh says. This hardier wool also allows for machine production, helping weavers save time on work that would otherwise take years, he adds.In the hybrids, however, Tibetan antelope guard hairs may also be hard to find. I remember one confiscated scarf Lisa Bradbury showed me in the basement storeroom in Bern. It was black with tiny red skulls and crossbones—reminiscent of a kitschy pirate flag. It had a short fringe like other shahtoosh I’d seen but otherwise looked very dissimilar. No guard hairs were apparent to the naked eye, perhaps because of the preponderance of pashmina in the weave. If this scarf hadn’t been found along with others that were obviously shahtoosh, Bradbury said, it might have avoided testing and slipped by, altogether unnoticed.",
"The thread of San Rafael River at the bottom of Utah's Little Grand Canyon may seem small now, but its once-mighty flow is what sculpted this magnificent gorge. This view of the canyon's plateaus in fading light is from the Wedge Overlook.Plateaus are sculpted by geologic forces that lift them up and the wind and rain that wear them down into mesas, buttes, and canyons. Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon, both icons of the American Southwest, were chiseled from the Colorado Plateau.Plateaus are built over millions of years as pieces of Earth's crust smash into each other, melt, and gurgle back toward the surface. Some owe their creation to a single process; others have been subjected to more than one during different epochs of Earth's history.The highest and biggest plateau on Earth, the Tibetan Plateau in East Asia, resulted from a collision between two tectonic plates about 55 million years ago. The land buckled up along the seam of the collision and formed the Himalaya mountain range. Farther away, the crust uplifted but didn't crumple and wrinkle, creating instead a raised, flat, and wide open expanse known as the "roof of the world."Yaks roam the Tibetan Plateau, the largest in the world.Many plateaus form as magma deep inside the Earth pushes toward the surface but fails to break through the crust. Instead, the magma lifts up the large, flat, impenetrable rock above it. Geologists believe a cushion of magma may have given the Colorado Plateau its final lift beginning about ten million years ago.Repeated lava flows that spill out from cracks in the ground and spread out over hundreds of square miles can also slowly build up massive plateaus. The Columbia Plateau in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Deccan Plateau of west-central India were formed by these runny lava flows.Plateaus also form in the ocean, such as the Mascarene Plateau in the Indian Ocean, one of the few underwater features clearly visible from space. It extends approximately 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) between the Seychelles and Mauritius Islands.Other plateaus are created over time as wind and rain wear away the side of an uplifted region, giving it geographic distinction from the surrounding terrain. Wind and rain eventually wear plateaus down to mesas and buttes and sculpt odd landforms like the arches and hoodoos found in southern Utah's famed national parks.Water is the greatest erosive force on plateaus. As they course along, rivers carve valleys into the rock, washing the sediment toward the sea. Over time, these valleys become giant, majestic chasms like the Grand Canyon, which is continually carved by the Colorado River.",
"A camera trap captures grizzly bears at a water hole in Yellowstone. Camera traps have minimal impact on the habitat and are one way of ensuring wild animals do not become accustomed to humans. The photo team also worked closely with the National Park Service to obtain the proper permits and to prioritize the welfare of the animals.Photographers have unprecedented tools, opportunities, and reach to find their animal subjects.At the same time, wild animals are facing unprecedented threats to their survival. Habitat loss, climate change, the illegal wildlife trade, overfishing, and pollution have caused the catastrophic decline of birds, insects, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians over the last few decades. A recent United Nations report found that one in four species faces extinction. In addition, modern society’s disconnect from nature presents its own threat, one of a culture of indifference. We lead virtual lives, plugged into devices instead of the outdoors.Wildlife photography has the power to turn people on to the wonder of nature. It’s an essential tool to inspire the desire to protect wildlife and spark real change. Photos can go viral on social media in mere minutes, bringing much-needed attention to wildlife in the throes of crisis.At the same time, social media throws together those who seek to visually capture nature in honest, careful ways with those who take shortcuts at the expense of the subject, intent only on more likes and followers. Viewers can’t tell the difference.So what does it mean to be an ethical wildlife photographer?“The ethics of photography are the same as the ethics of life, and all revolve around respect,” says National Geographic photographer Beverly Joubert, who has spent decades photographing African wildlife. There are few one-size-fits-all rules and lots of gray areas. What is ethical to one may be unethical to another. We must be guided by compassion and conservation and put the welfare of the subject first.Though there is no guidebook, there are a few basic principles that can help make the way clearer.There’s no question we have an impact when we venture into wildlife’s territory. We seek or stumble onto their roosts and dens, their feeding and gathering places. Does that mean we shouldn’t ever get out there and raise our cameras? Absolutely not. Nature needs our stories, now more than ever. But nature also needs us to come in with a heightened level of awareness of our effects.A crush of tourists try to photograph a cheetah in Kenya’s Masai Mara National Reserve. The presence of humans can disturb an animal’s ability to engage in natural behaviors.National Geographic Photo Ark founder and photographer Joel Sartore emphasizes that the first principle must be “do no harm.” On a basic level, it means not destroying habitat to make for a more picturesque scene. It means not causing wildlife to stop hunting, eating, and resting, or to threaten or charge you.Breeding season requires special care. Avoid actions that might result in driving parents away from the young, which leaves them open to predators and the elements. Never alter vegetation around nests or dens, as it provides critical camouflage as well as protection from sun, wind, and rain.We must continuously observe animal behavior and realize when we need to back off or walk away. Reading up in advance and being educated about wildlife behavior is the best means we have to recognize alarm or avoidance in a particular species.The kindest thing we can do for wild animals is to honor their wildness. The quickest way to compromise that wildness is to offer food so we can get a photo. Yellowstone National Park’s website plainly states: “A fed animal is a dead animal—good or bad, the Park Service will destroy animals that are habituated to human contact and food.”Predators such as foxes, coyotes, wolves, bears, owls, and other raptors learn rapidly to associate humans with food. They may get comfortable approaching humans for food, and if they get too bold or aggressive, wildlife agencies often kill them. Animals may come also to haunt roadsides, as many people feed them from cars, putting them at risk of becoming roadkill. (Learn more about problems associated with feeding wildlife.)What of the wild bears, wolves, and wolverines in places like Romania and Finland, offered food near blinds for photographers within? This has become big business in eastern and northern Europe. The only downside observed so far is that it’s more manufactured than reality: Those photos of bears and wolves hanging out together as “friends” is only possible because they simply happen to be near so much food they don’t come to blows over it.National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry captured this great white shark swimming in waters off the Neptune Islands, in South Australia. Chumming, or baiting sharks with fish, allows divers to see them in the wild, but the long-term impacts on shark behavior are unknown. Read more about chumming here.So when is it OK to use food to lure photographic subjects? There’s no straight answer, but these questions can help guide you.It’s crucial to learn and heed laws and regulations in local, state, and national parks, such as how much distance to keep between us and particular species. These exist to keep us and the wildlife safe. There’s no shortage of news stories about tourists who ignored national parks’ rules on distance and got injured. In many cases, the animal must be put down.In any park or other protected area, if we plan on making commercial photography, guiding workshops, or deploying camera traps, we’re required to obtain the necessary permits. This includes marine protected areas.Zebras run across the plains in Namibia, disturbed by the photographer’s paraglider. Before the advent of drones, it was difficult to get any aerial views of wildlife bothering the animals.A "microcopter" captures a lioness and her cubs resting among a rocky outcrop in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. The family is undisturbed by the presence of this drone.Use of drones around wildlife is a controversial topic, and laws vary widely. They're not allowed in U.S. national parks, wilderness areas, and nature preserves. And for those places where they are allowed, we must still consider their effects on the wildlife. A well-known 2015 study documented the effect of drones on the heart rates of black bears in Minnesota. Though there were no outward signs of stress, bears’ heart rates rose as much as 123 beats per minute above the pre-flight baseline when a drone was present. (Learn the dark truth behind the "inspirational" bear video that really wasn't.)Captive wildlife photography is a popular pursuit, especially for people who may not be able or willing to travel to far-flung places to see wildlife in its element. A wide range of facilities offer opportunities to photograph exotic animals, including zoos, sanctuaries, rescues, reserves, game farms, wildlife centers, refuges, adventure parks, and safari parks. Living conditions for captive wildlife run the gamut from sordid to exemplary, just as the reasons for their captivity run the gamut from greed to compassion.The world of captive wildlife is a massive, lightly regulated industry. Facilities can call themselves anything, and so-called “pseudo-sanctuaries” abound. In the U.S., they need only a USDA license to display wild animals to the public.In some cases, captive wildlife may have been injured and rescued from the wild. Well cared for, they serve as ambassadors for their species. In others, they may have been confiscated from a facility that mistreated them and are living out their days in a safe, quiet refuge. Or they may be displayed in a roadside zoo for profit, their lives spent in a tiny cage with a cement floor.Then there are photography game farms. These are captive facilities that cater expressly to cameras. These places, most located in Montana and Minnesota, promise spectacular images of exotic wildlife such as Siberian tigers and snow leopards, and native, elusive species such as wolves, lynx, and bobcats. These genetically wild animals, by instinct wired to hunt and roam over great distances, may live in small enclosures except when performing for clients’ cameras, coaxed with treats and prods by a handler just out of the frame. They surge through snow head-on, or freeze perfectly within the crook of a tree. Sometimes they’re trucked to other states to pose in alternate settings, like the red rocks of Utah. They are impeccable, showing no signs of dirt, ratty coats, or lean times.Game farm owners defend their operations, saying animals that are born in captivity don’t have the same drives or needs as animals born in the wild, or that they live longer because they have reliable sources of food and protection from predators and the elements. But animal consciousness expert Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, argues that “It’s not just existence that matters. A person can live in prison in good health for a long time. What matters is quality of life. Different institutions and establishments vary widely in the quality of life experienced by creatures under their care.”Much of the photo industry condemns game farms, and photos from them are prohibited in high-profile photo contests and most major magazines, including National Geographic. For every species held by a game farm, there is a conservation photographer who has carefully and conscientiously photographed that species in the wild, in its true habitat, exhibiting natural behavior. (Check out, for example, what it took to find and photograph the rare helmeted hornbill.)We must recognize that the dollars we spend will validate and perpetuate the living conditions those animals have found themselves in, through no choice of their own.There are organizations that can help determine whether a self-titled “sanctuary,” “refuge,” or “rescue” is really what it claims to be. Start with the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries (GFSA). GFSA-accredited facilities must meet high standards of care and management. Another source is the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Though some may debate whether every AZA-accredited operation offers the quality of life to a captive animal that we would wish, these places are held to high standards of care. (Note that the AZA is distinct from the ZAA—Zoological Association of America—a controversial coalition with a confusing acronym.)Ethical practice in wildlife photography doesn’t end when we return to the comforts of home. How we represent the truth of an animal’s life when we share our photos matters.“Level with the reader,” Sartore says. “Tell them the backstory if there's something about how the image was made that isn't obvious just by viewing it. Be upfront if you're working with a trained animal, or if the animal took its own picture using a camera trap.” If it’s an exceptional or unexpected capture, with an important story to it, take a few words to explain how it happened.Photographer Joel Sartore photographs a dwarf caiman at the Sunset Zoo for National Geographic's Photo Ark. Photo Ark captions always include the location of the shoot so the reader knows how the photo was made, and Sartore works closely with keepers to ensure the welfare of the animal during the process.Brian Skerry, a longtime National Geographic photographer who specializes in marine wildlife, puts it this way: “If I’m taking a picture of a tiger shark and don’t disclose the use of chum to attract it, in the caption or when questioned, then I’m being dishonest. In the most basic terms, if the intent is to deceive the viewer, then it’s wrong.” This applies to processing our photos as well, he points out. Correcting color, for example, is fine. But if you alter the reality of a scene by cloning out or adding elements that weren’t there to begin with, you’re crossing a line in photojournalism.Transparency in captioning is also a useful way to check in with ourselves. If we’re not comfortable sharing how we got the shot, maybe that’s a clue that we might not have made the best choice in getting it.Word travels fast in the wildlife photography community, and fakery or harmful field practices can be readily exposed. These days, it’s not just editors and other photographers that are on the lookout; increasingly, viewers on social media are too, speaking up when things appear suspect.“One of the things I tell young photographers at the end of the day is, never forget that your reputation is everything. If you want to take shortcuts, if you’re exposed, you will set everything back decades,” Skerry says. “You have to be above reproach. You have to do it right.”“It’s also the responsibility of the photo editor to ask questions,” says National Geographic photo editor Kathy Moran. “It’s incumbent upon us to go back to the photographer to ask how the image was made, to ask to see a RAW file. We bear responsibility for maintaining integrity as well.”Take the time to partner with scientists and researchers to make sure that what you’re posting is accurate, Skerry says. Bridge the gap between science and photography to add authenticity to what you’re doing.These basic principles provide a starting point. It’s up to each of us to build common sense and compassion into our practice. We may not have all the answers, and we may make mistakes, but we can continuously strive to be empathic and aware. It’s up to each of us to use the power we have as wildlife photographers to act with great care for the animals that gift us with their presence. These are just about photos to us; but to a wild animal, every single moment is about survival.",
"Birdfeeders, while popular among homeowners, can have downsides for wildlife. But are those issues outweighed by their benefits?Whether it’s a birdfeeder on an apartment terrace or a corn feeder for backyard deer, many people enjoy attracting wildlife with the offer of food.But experts say doing so can have dangerous consequences for both animals and humans.Feeding sites bring many different kinds of animals into the same small area, which can turn into a hotbed for disease transmission and parasites, says Jeannine Fleegle, a wildlife biologist for the Pennsylvania State Game Commission.For instance, scientists suspect a fatal disease affecting deer known as Chronic Wasting Disease is spread by exposure to urine, saliva, and feces—all of which get mixed together when animals congregate at feeders.“Feed used to attract deer will draw turkeys, squirrels, racoons, opossums, rodents, skunks, and foxes, directly or indirectly,” says Fleegle. “And just as feed sites increase risk of disease exposure and transmission in deer and elk, these sites will do the same for these species.”Canine distemper, parvovirus, leptospirosis, Baylisascaris, and avian pox are all diseases or parasites that can be spread at feeding sites.“Feeding wildlife is generally a bad idea, no matter what the species or where you are,” says Fleegle.Anyone who has ever seen a raccoon nibbling on some peanut butter knows the animals can look every bit as cute and cuddly as a family pet. But all wild animals, even the small ones, are capable of inflicting harm.In fact, food-seeking squirrels bite more people than any other animal in Grand Canyon National Park. (Related: “How to stay safe around wild animals”)Providing a buffet for wildlife also teaches those animals to associate humans with food. This can make them more likely to get hit by cars, get into altercations with children or pets, and ultimately, have to be put down by wildlife managers.This is why experts often say, “A fed bear is a dead bear.” (Here's why feeding bears is worse than you think.)Nutrition is another important factor to consider when deciding whether or not to feed wildlife.Animals will often make use of a reliable or easy food source even if it isn’t one that suits their nutritional needs. For instance, feeding deer a lot of corn can disrupt the natural balance of acid in the animals’ stomachs and lead to a condition called lactic acidosis, or grain overload.“This condition has been documented as a cause of death in both deer and elk in Pennsylvania,” says Fleegle.Feeding can also alter the ways animals move throughout a landscape, affecting distribution patterns. More animals in one spot can also lead to more fighting and injuries, says Fleegle.While it may seem like common sense not to feed a grizzly or an alligator, the question of whether to feed backyard birds is a bit trickier. Especially since food put out for birds can also attract many other creatures.Just like any other kind of food station, birdfeeders can be culprits in spreading of disease, says Kate Plummer, a research ecologist at the British Trust for Ornithology. Especially if they aren’t kept clean.Birdfeeders can attract squirrels and other unwanted animals.For instance, a disease known as trichomonosis has killed millions of birds and caused the United Kingdom’s greenfinch population to decline by around 60 percent since 2006, says Plummer.But birdfeeders can also be a boon for biodiversity.In a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications, Plummer found that people are seeing a more diverse array of bird species in backyards now than they did in the 1970s. And this change has coincided with the evolution of the birdfeeder market.Where people might have once used simply corn or sunflower seeds, there's now suet, mealworms, and fat balls, rapeseed and sorghum and white proso millet, and each supports different species.“It’s the first time really that we’ve seen this quite obvious, large-scale impact of what we’re doing in our own backyards and how that’s affecting the composition of the birds that we see around us,” says Plummer. “It's quite profound.”It’s also important to consider that many of these species would have lived in woodlands and farmlands—places that have increasingly been turned into human developments.“So these birds are finding what they need to survive in our gardens and in our feeders now,” says Plummer.",
"Bison and elk share winter ranges in Greater Yellowstone—these are in the National Elk Refuge near Jackson, Wyoming. Both can carry brucellosis, a threat to cattle. But elk are prized as game, whereas thousands of Yellowstone bison have been slaughtered in Montana because some consider them a menace.Wild animals do not recognize park borders. Two of Yellowstone’s iconic species, bison and elk, spill seasonally—and naturally—beyond park boundaries looking for food. One is welcome. The other is not.Two years ago, Yellowstone’s chief scientist Dave Hallac gazed north from a sagebrush-covered rise near Mammoth Hot Springs across the park border into Montana. Musing aloud, he asked:“What would happen, do you think, if we managed our migratory elk the same way we’re forced to manage bison? What if we chased elk back into the park on horseback to prevent them from leaving? What if we rounded up elk into corrals and sent them to slaughterhouses? What if we allowed pregnant elk mothers to be shot just a few weeks before they were due to give birth? Do you think there would be public outrage?”Ranchers in Montana worry that their cattle—mixing on public grazing lands with wild bison from the park—could become infected with brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can cause pregnant cows to abort their calves. For those ranchers, infection could result in costly quarantines and restrictions on trading cattle and shipping them to market.A Yellowstone bison held temporarily at Ted Turner’s Flying D ranch is retested for brucellosis. When two of the ranch’s own commercial bison recently tested positive— infected by wild elk grazing the same pastures—they were euthanized and then necropsied at a lab in Bozeman, Montana.A bison raised on the Flying D ranch near Bozeman, Montana, is put down after showing possible signs of brucellosis, a serious disease transmissible to cattle. Whether Yellowstone’s wild bison pose a similar threat is a matter of heated controversy.Here’s the irony: Both bison and elk can carry brucellosis. And while bison have been regarded by Montana livestock officials as the primary brucellosis threat, in the past 30 years there have been no documented cases of Yellowstone bison directly transmitting the disease to cattle. Any outbreaks in beef herds near the park have instead been traced to elk.But in spite of statistics, the state has taken a hard line, refusing to let Yellowstone bison stray naturally outside the park boundaries. Park managers have been forced, by court order and a bison management plan many see as flawed, to kill and harass creatures they otherwise spend most of their time stewarding with respect and dignity. Since 1985, more than 9,000 animals have been destroyed after crossing Yellowstone’s invisible and fenceless northern and western borders.“It’s a big deal bison are still with us,” says Lee Whittlesey, Yellowstone’s park historian. “The protection of the bison as a species, because of their fortunate existence in Yellowstone, is, in the opinion of a great number of us, what saved the animal from total destruction.”A fetus was removed from an infected bison that had been euthanized and necropsied at a Bozeman lab.Whittlesey refers to the massive slaughter of wildlife, mainly by market hunters, that occurred during the middle to late 1800s. During that time, a continental population of 35 million bison was brought to the brink of extinction. The park, established in 1872, served as a sanctuary for just two dozen survivors. Today some 5,000 bison, beloved by visitors, roam within the park.Yellowstone Superintendent Dan Wenk said in a recent interview that concerns about disease mask an entirely different reason for the state to thwart bison migration. He says the truth behind the conflict involves a battle for turf: Members of the livestock industry don’t want cattle to have to compete with bison for the grass on public lands outside the park.The public, of course, has its own voice—and every year outrage over the harassing and slaughtering of bison grows. Finally, driven by pressure from citizens, Yellowstone Park and the state of Montana, lead by Governor Steve Bullock, are in the midst of drafting a new management plan that could let bison leave the park in winter and allow a small number to live permanently on nearby national forest lands.At Fort Hall, Idaho, outside a sweat lodge where Shoshone-Bannock tribe members gather for purification ceremonies, Leo Teton stands next to a pole ornamented with bison skulls. The animals were taken near Yellowstone in hunts that express tribe members' spiritual connection to the animal and affirm long-standing treaty rights. Bison loom large as sacred animals in traditional Native American customs and rituals.“When you consider this from a science, economics, public opinion, and commonsense perspective, it makes a ton of sense for Montana to give wild bison from Yellowstone year-round habitat in the state,” says Matt Skoglund, northern Rockies regional director with the Natural Resources Defense Council.There are no lethal management policies to keep elk from moving in and out of Yellowstone. They largely have free rein in Montana—despite the fact that they carry brucellosis, just as bison do. The reason for the difference: Elk have a vocal fan club within the state’s big-game hunting community.But the threat of brucellosis remains real. South of Yellowstone, in the state of Wyoming, that threat just takes a different form.For more than a century, thousands of elk wintering on the National Elk Refuge near Jackson have been fed artificial grass pellets to keep numbers high in the absence of adequate habitat.  The Wyoming Game and Fish Department operates 22 similar feed grounds.At a ranch in southwestern Montana, Robbie Magnan and other Fort Peck tribe members ceremoniously butcher a Yellowstone bison, removing its heart. Surplus park bison were kept at the ranch before going to the Fort Peck Reservation. This male was too dangerous to transport.But when elk congregate in unnaturally large numbers on feed grounds, the rate of brucellosis infection increases. Wildlife veterinarians warn that these crowded animals become vulnerable to an outbreak of an always fatal chronic wasting disease, a cousin of mad cow disease, that is rapidly spreading west across Wyoming in migratory deer herds.Some say the solution is to stop feeding elk. But that remedy is roundly opposed by outfitters and guides who benefit from having more elk available for their high-paying clients and fellow hunters.The side of a harvested bull elk and its prized antlers are transported the old-fashioned way—by mule. More than 72,000 hunters came to the lands around Yellowstone and Grand Teton in 2014, many enlisting guides to equip them and lead them to their quarry.As of this spring, chronic wasting has shown up in deer just miles away from Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and the National Elk Refuge.There are no simple solutions. With both bison in Montana and elk in Wyoming, politics and culture trump ecological prescription. “We have the knowledge and wherewithal to be smarter,” Dave Hallac told me when he left Yellowstone to become superintendent of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. “While getting there isn’t easy, it’s only our own unwillingness to think out of the box that is holding us back.”Members of the Cody herd traverse the remote Thorofare Plateau, just outside the southeast corner of Yellowstone. The elk bands graze there until early autumn, when snow pushes them out of the mountains.In a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"A bear at the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center outside Yellowstone tests a bear-proof garbage container—important for making sure bears don't get too comfortable coming to town to eat.West Yellowstone, Mont.Sow 101, a grizzly bear, has had a long and productive life. In her first 20 years, she ranged between Yellowstone National Park and the wild lands outside West Yellowstone, Montana, raising somewhere between three and four sets of cubs. She was the 101st grizzly to get a GPS collar as part of a National Park Service study—hence her name.But then, in the early ‘90s, she began eating garbage and pet food that had been carelessly left out by residents in a suburb north of town. Because of the risk of conflict with humans, wildlife officials relocated her deeper into the park. There she happily remained—for a while.Ten years later, however, there was a drought in Yellowstone, and food became scarce. Sow 101 sought out the place she’d come to learn, a decade earlier, had reliable food: the suburbs. So Sow 101 and her two cubs began eating people’s garbage and pet food once again.After repeatedly returning to the same houses to forage, wildlife officials decided she needed to be removed from the wild entirely. She and her two cubs posed too much of a danger to humans, says Trent Redfield, with the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center, an educational wildlife facility that shelters human-acclimated bears and other wildlife, located just outside Yellowstone. (Read more: How can we learn to let the wild be wild in Yellowstone?)Sow 101 now lives at the discovery center and is 37 years old—much older than the median lifespan of female grizzlies in captivity. Her two cubs lived for a while at the center, but they were later moved to Washington State University because the facility didn’t have enough space for two full-grown animals.Sow’s removal from the wild could’ve been avoided, but in a way, she—and the humans in the suburbs—were lucky. When bears and other predators are repeatedly drawn to human settlements, they can become bold around humans, especially when they come to equate them with food. That puts humans at risk. If the bears can’t be relocated or taught to avoid the area and human food, they may be taken into captivity, like Sow—or even killed, if they become aggressive or destructive.With protective grizzly bear mothers, the risk is even greater. “With a mother with two cubs, things could’ve gone really badly,” Redfield says. “If people are careless with their food and garbage, that’s where we get situations where bears are hurt and [people’s] property [is] destroyed, and that may ultimately lead to the bears being killed as well.”On this bright morning at the center, a young male bear named Coram bounds around his large enclosure, pulling out rocks where foods has been hidden, his brown coat showing a sheen of silver in a certain light. He came to the center after three relocation attempts failed to keep him away from food left out by homeowners in the town of Coram, Montana, his namesake.“He took groceries out of somebody’s pickup truck when they got home from the store,” Redfield says, and ran off with a loaf of bread. “At that point, being that bold in human areas is going to lead to conflict.” (Learn how not to get attacked by a bear.)At the center, Coram and two other younger males, Grant and Roosevelt, sniff intently at the rocks before intermittently wrestling. But mainly, the huge bears seem intent on finding something to eat—an instinct that drives much of their behavior: Last night, as part of National Geographic Channel’s Yellowstone Live, the center did a live demonstration to show the lengths the bears will go to get a meal.Caretakers placed three coolers with food inside within the center’s bear enclosure, under a blanket on the bed of a truck. Coram and Grant quickly smelled the food and ripped into two of the coolers. Grant bounded off with a trout, while the third, locked bear-proof cooler remained unscathed.As easily as bears can learn to equate humans with food, they can also learn that human food is more work than it’s worth, according to Rae Wynn-Grant, a large carnivore ecologist and National Geographic explorer. She says bears’ feeding behavior is an illustration of optimal foraging strategy, whereby animals exert the minimum effort necessary to acquire the maximum amount of calories. Because human food is often calorie-dense, if the animals get access to it, they can quickly learn to prefer it, she says.Grizzly bears wrestle at the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center, which takes in bears that have become too comfortable around humans or otherwise couldn't survive in the wild.However, bear-proof coolers and garbage cans, for example, can teach bears that it’s not worth the effort. “If they try over and over to open the can but can’t, they’ll stop trying and hopefully go back to a natural food source,” she says. More aggressive tactics include setting off firecrackers near bears, chasing them away with specially trained dogs, or shooting them with nonlethal rubber bullets.It’s not just carelessness that puts bears at risk—intentionally feeding them can also cause major problems. Such was the case for another bear named Sam, who came to the center in 1996. At six months old, he lived near Katmai National Park, in Alaska. After his mom died, he found his way to a town called King Salmon, where people began feeding the skinny, 50-pound cub out of pity, Redfield says.Cubs, however, don’t stay cubs for long. “Sam is now over 1,000 pounds,” Redfield says. A bear like that coming into human areas—that could be really dangerous, he adds. After repeatedly returning to the town for food, Alaska state wildlife officials made the decision to move him to a captive environment.The stories like Sow’s, Coram’s, and Sam’s show the repercussions of feeding the animals. Normally, bears “go out of their way to avoid people,” Redfield explains, and don’t come into human areas unless there are attractants. But the price of carelessness—or intentional feeding—can be deadly. Some facilities such as the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center, can provide homes to these animals, but not all bears are that fortunate.Besides bear-proof garbage cans, Redfield suggests that people keep pet food inside and take care to make sure bird feeders are secure. Basically, just prevent bears from getting access to anything edible, he says.“That can ultimately protect you yourself, your neighbors, and keep bears healthy and wild,” he adds.",
"On August 7, 2015, in Yellowstone National Park, a ranger found the chewed-upon body of a man near a hiking trail not far from one of the park’s largest hotels. The deceased was soon identified as Lance Crosby, 63 years old, from Billings, Montana. He had worked seasonally as a nurse at a medical clinic in the park and been reported missing by co-workers that morning.Investigation revealed that Crosby was hiking alone on the previous day, without bear spray, and ran afoul of a female grizzly with two cubs. The sow, after killing and partially eating him (not necessarily in that order), and allowing the cubs to eat too, cached his remains beneath dirt and pine duff, as grizzlies do when they intend to reclaim a piece of meat. Once trapped and persuasively linked to Crosby by DNA evidence, she was given a sedative and an anesthetic and then executed, on grounds that an adult grizzly bear that has eaten human flesh and cached a body is too dangerous to be spared, even if the fatal encounter wasn’t her fault. “We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim,” said Park Superintendent Dan Wenk, a reasonable man charged with a difficult task: keeping Yellowstone safe for both people and wildlife.Lance Crosby’s death was just the seventh bear-caused fatality in the park during the past hundred years. The next most recent occurred in the summer of 2011, when two people died in separate events, possibly killed by a single female grizzly. After the first killing, of a man named Brian Matayoshi, the bear had been spared by Wenk—with advice from bear managers—on grounds that she was defending her cubs and the attack on Matayoshi wasn’t predatory. Because the Matayoshi killing occurred on the Wapiti Lake trail, she became known as the Wapiti sow. Later she turned up near the second victim, a man named John Wallace, who died eight miles away in what might have been a predatory attack. Wallace’s body, like Lance Crosby’s, had been partially eaten and then cached. Physical evidence didn’t prove that the Wapiti sow had killed him but strongly suggested that she had at least fed on the body, and so she was put down. The sorry events of 2011, and that well-meant choice to give the Wapiti sow a reprieve after Matayoshi’s death, help explain the decision to condemn the 2015 sow after one incident.Norris Geyser Basin, Porcelain BasinMidway Geyser BasinGrizzly bears, clearly, can be dangerous animals. But the danger they represent should be seen in perspective: In the 144 years since Yellowstone was established, more people have died there of drowning and of scalding in thermal pools, and of suicide, than have been killed by bears. Almost as many people have died from lightning strikes. Two people have been killed by bison.The real lesson inherent in the death of Lance Crosby, and in the equally regrettable death of the bear that killed him, is a reminder of something too easily forgotten: Yellowstone is a wild place, constrained imperfectly within human-imposed limits. It’s a wild place that we have embraced, surrounded, riddled with roads and hotels and souvenir shops, but not tamed, not conquered—a place we treasure because it still represents wildness. It’s filled with wonders of nature—fierce animals, deep canyons, scalding waters—that are magnificent to behold but fretful to engage. Most of us, when we visit Yellowstone, see it as if through a Plexiglas window. We gaze from our cars at a roadside bear, we stand at an overlook above a great river, we stroll boardwalks amid the geyser basins, experiencing the park as a diorama. We remain safe and dry. Our shoes don’t get muddy with sulfurous gunk. But the Plexiglas window doesn’t exist, and the diorama is real. It’s painted in blood—the blood of many wild creatures, dying violently in the natural course of relations with one another, predator and prey, and occasionally also the blood of humans. Walk just 200 yards off the road into a forested gully or a sagebrush flat, and you had better be carrying, as Lance Crosby wasn’t, a canister of bear spray. Your park entrance receipt won’t protect you. You can be killed and eaten. But if you are, despite the fact that you have freely made your own choices, there may be retribution.This is the paradox of Yellowstone, and of most other national parks we have added since: wilderness contained, nature under management, wild animals obliged to abide by human rules. It’s the paradox of the cultivated wild. At a national park in Africa—Serengeti in Tanzania, for instance, or Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya, Kruger in South Africa—you wouldn’t face such ambiguity. You would view the dangerous beasts, the lions and elephants and leopards and buffalo, from the safety of your Land Rover or your safari van, seldom if ever strolling through their habitat on foot. But in America we’ve chosen to do things differently, and Yellowstone, because it’s the first national park, an iconic place known throughout the world, which millions of people visit each year, is where the paradox is most powerfully played out.Yellowstone is also the eponym of the biggest and richest complex of mostly untamed landscape and wildlife within the lower 48 states. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is an amoeboid expanse encompassing two national parks (Grand Teton is the second) as well as national forests, wildlife refuges, and other public and private holdings, the whole shebang amounting to 22.6 million acres, an order of magnitude bigger than Yellowstone Park itself. Surrounding this great amoeba is a modest transition zone, where you will more likely find cattle than elk, more likely see a grain elevator than a grizzly bear, and more likely hear the bark of a black Labrador than the howl of a wolf. Bounding that buffer is 21st-century America: highways, towns, parking lots, malls, endlessly sprawling suburbs, golf courses, Starbucks.Question: Can we hope to preserve, in the midst of modern America, any such remnant of our continent’s primordial landscape, any such sample of true wildness—a gloriously inhospitable place, full of predators and prey, in which nature is still allowed to be red in tooth and claw? Can that sort of place be reconciled with human demands and human convenience? Time alone, and our choices, will tell. But if the answer is yes, the answer is Yellowstone.The best overview of Yellowstone Park comes from 300 feet airborne above the landscape itself. So on a clear summer morning, I met Roger Stradley at an airport near Bozeman, Montana, for an aerial tour of Yellowstone in his yellow 1956 Piper Super Cub. He issued me a flight suit and a helmet, then showed me how to insert myself into the rear seat, a cramped space directly behind the pilot’s. I’ve been in kayaks with more legroom.“You don’t get into a Super Cub,” he said. “You put it on.” Small and light, the Super Cub is still favored by old-school bush pilots such as Stradley for its capacity to land on and take off from short strips, and to ride the thermals like a condor. Flying slow and low is especially useful for surveying wildlife, and Stradley is legendary among the biologists of Yellowstone Park who rely on overflights for their work. A robust, cheerful 76-year-old, he has flown in the mountains for 62 years, logging a mere 70,000 hours.We rose up over Bozeman, crossed the Gallatin Range, and flew east along the gently sloped north side of Mount Everts, named for Truman Everts, an unlucky man who went missing from one of the first expeditions to Yellowstone in the late 19th century and survived a month of lonely misery before being rescued. We crossed the Blacktail Deer Plateau, a loaf of raised terrain, where Stradley alerted me through my helmet headphones to a wolf den, signaled by bare dirt and dig marks beneath the exposed roots of a large Douglas fir. Stradley saw, though I couldn’t, a single black wolf lying there in the shade. That animal would be part of the old Eight Mile pack, he said, which had since fissioned, as wolf packs do when they get too large.We traced the Yellowstone River upstream past Tower Fall, catching a flash of rainbow through the mist, and then crossed Antelope Creek toward Mount Washburn, passing over uplands patched with brown, dead trees burned in a recent fire. Good bear habitat, Stradley said. Elk to eat, plus lots of mushrooms—morels, sprouting up from the burn. “You don’t want to go in there and pick them, because you’re going to have competition with the grizzlies.” Duly noted.We swung back toward the Lamar Valley in the park’s northeast corner, broad and grassy between sage-covered hillsides, punctuated with glacial erratics, large boulders from elsewhere left behind by the moving ice of the Pleistocene. We circled above Rose Creek, site of one of the acclimation pens from which Canadian wolves were released into the park back in 1995, after an absence of almost 70 years following their systematic extirpation early in the century. We could see yellow flowers peppered across the meadows of grass and sage—the rich yellow of balsamroot, the paler yellow of biscuit-root, which signals a tuber that bears eat. Lacking geysers and a great canyon, the Lamar Valley isn’t for everyone, but to some eyes it’s the most exquisite corner of Yellowstone.We flew down the east shore of Yellowstone Lake into a roadless area, protected on one side by water and on another by the crest of the Absaroka Range. Near the south tip of the lake’s Southeast Arm is the delta of the upper Yellowstone River, a broad bottomland of willows, grasses, and shrubs in five shades of green. This day the upper river was brownish olive, reflecting fast July runoff from melting snow, though I noticed one oxbow pond, its water a deep, tranquil blue. We buzzed upstream in stately progress, so low and slow that it felt as though we were riding a kite. We crossed the park boundary, an invisible line, and turned east to follow a tributary called Thorofare Creek toward its rocky headwaters, where the Yellowstone, which is America’s longest undammed river (outside of Alaska), has one of its sources. This area, known simply as the Thorofare, is the most remote spot in the lower 48 states. “Thirty miles from anything,” Stradley said.After three hours of flying we pointed ourselves back toward the airport, but first we swung over the Norris Geyser Basin, getting a nice view of all the little hot springs and ponds dotting the area in shades of aquamarine, orange, yellow, and chartreuse. Ahead of us then was the Gallatin Range, not as lofty and jagged as the Absarokas though high enough to retain snow patches and cornices at this season. On one of those white patches we glimpsed a cluster of dark figures and, swooping closer, made out their forms: seven wolves plus a grizzly bear, sharing a little snowfield at uneasy proximity and 9,000 feet elevation.Stradley pulled up his camera, wanting to get a photo of the animals as we circled back. Now he was flying the plane with his knees. “I don’t know why they’re up so high,” he said. “What’s the attraction?”Before I knew it, we were two mountains along, looking down on another bear, a huge one. This grizzly was on a flat above Fan Creek, munching contentedly amid a patch of yellow balsamroot and other vegetation. Again we circled. Stradley seemed puzzled. Balsamroot is not usually mentioned as a grizzly food, although the bear’s dietary choices in Yellowstone are formidably diverse, according to a recent authoritative paper. The list includes 266 kinds of plant, animal, and fungus, ranging from bison flesh to morels, from western waterweed to moose, and from chipmunks to 25 kinds of grass. Was the bear grazing? Didn’t seem to be. Digging up tubers? No. “Might be eating the flowers,” Stradley said. And it was possible: Kerry Gunther, the park’s senior bear biologist, later told me that balsamroot flowers have indeed been found in grizzly scat. So that’s what I took away, my last vivid impression from our eagle-view tour: a humongous grizzly bear alone on a hill above the Gallatin River, eating flowers.The park lies atop what geologists call the Yellowstone Plateau, with an average elevation of 8,000 feet. Dense stands of lodgepole pine cover this great uplift, and high meadows of grass and sage, as well as some lesser bulges such as Blacktail Deer Plateau and a network of gently undulant roads, all across ground that appears cold and static. Don’t be fooled.There’s a dramatic geological reason for the height of the Yellowstone Plateau. Directly beneath it lies a vast volcanic hot spot, a gigantic channel in Earth’s mantle and crust, through which magma rises, releasing heat that further melts the rocks, creating a massive plume. That thermal torrent comprises two magma chambers of partly molten rock, one atop the other, bulging the land surface into an enormous pustule. Around the bulge, like disorderly ramparts, loom mountains that are older and higher—most notably the Tetons, the Absarokas, the Gallatins. On the plateau itself, geologists have traced the evidence of three huge calderas, representing the scars left by three stupendous explosions over the past 2.1 million years. Those explosions, and the volcanic forces that powered them, have earned Yellowstone’s hot spot the label “supervolcano.” Ordinary volcanoes generally occur along the edges of tectonic plates; supervolcanoes blaze directly through those plates, like a stationary torch burning blisters through a sliding sheet of steel. And the Yellowstone torch, feeding heat toward preposterous eruptions, is likely the largest beneath any continent on Earth.“It all starts with heat,” according to Robert B. Smith of the University of Utah, who has studied Yellowstone’s geology for more than five decades. While the North American plate has drifted southwestward over the mantle plume during the past 16 million years, the hot spot has left its marks in a northeastward series of volcanic centers, 500 miles long, from what we now call southeastern Oregon and across Idaho to its current location. The most recent of the three giant upheavals at Yellowstone occurred about 640,000 years ago, spewing 240 cubic miles of volcanic ash into the atmosphere and leaving a rimmed crater that now encompasses Old Faithful, the Hayden Valley, and half of Yellowstone Lake. That one is known as the Yellowstone Caldera. There have also been many smaller volcanic eruptions in the millennia since.The implications of these geological facts are fateful. After the ash settled and the land cooled, the Yellowstone Plateau remained a site of extraordinary volcanic activity, its relatively thin earthly crust floating above the hot spot’s upper magma chamber, which heats the subterranean waters that emanate as geysers and fumaroles and mud pots and colorful hot springs, all penetrating the surface like whistles on a great calliope. Gradually the plateau’s forests regrew, its animal populations recolonized. Meanwhile a combination of gouging and splitting forces, including ice, flowing water, and geological faulting, opened a notch along which the Yellowstone River carved its own Grand Canyon (big and impressive, though not nearly so vast as Arizona’s), thundering over a pair of spectacular drops.Humans arrived, distant ancestors of the Sheep Eater, Bannock, Crow, and other native peoples whose traditions still connect them to this place, moving on and off the plateau as their nomadism led them in search of food and furs and seasonally comfortable living. The place-name itself, Yellowstone, according to the late historian Aubrey L. Haines, may have come as translation of a Hidatsa phrase, Mi tse a-da-zi, referring to yellowish sandstone bluffs along a lower stretch of the river. In part because the plateau’s high elevation made for especially severe winters, Yellowstone wasn’t fought over, seized, and settled during the early waves of Euro-American invasion. Some mountain men and fur trappers saw a bit of it, including John Colter and Jim Bridger, who told tales. Much later, in the years 1869 to 1871, three different expeditions of more citified white men, along with some military personnel, visited the area and were impressed, in particular, by the geysers and the canyon.One of those men, Nathaniel Langford, was described by Haines as “a sickly St. Paul bank clerk” who made his timely exit from Minnesota and went west after a family-owned bank failed. While playing a catalytic role in the 1870 Yellowstone expedition, Langford was a paid publicist for the Northern Pacific Railroad. Another member of that 1870 expedition, Walter Trumbull, noted afterward in a magazine article that the plateau seemed promising as sheep pasture, but he predicted, “When, however, by means of the Northern Pacific Railroad, the falls of the Yellowstone and the geyser basin are rendered easy of access, probably no portion of America will be more popular as a watering place or summer resort.” Langford and his cronies saw that such popularity would mean money in the tills of the Northern Pacific and of whoever else got a piece of the action, selling rail tickets, filling hotels.The 1871 expedition, led by Ferdinand V. Hayden, head of the U.S. Geological Survey of the Territories, was more official—supported by a congressional appropriation—and included the photographer William Henry Jackson and the painter Thomas Moran, visual artists whose images subsequently helped people back East (most crucially, those in Congress) see and imagine Yellowstone. Moran created one especially thunderous painting in 1872, seven feet by twelve, “The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.” An agent for the Northern Pacific then planted a suggestion that lawmakers protect the “Great Geyser Basin” as a public park. Hayden seized that idea and, along with Langford and other minions of the railroad, lobbied for it, as delineated in a bill encompassing not just the geyser basins but also the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone Lake, the Lamar Valley, and other terrain, altogether a rectangle of some two million acres.The Yosemite Valley in California, which earlier had been granted to that state for protection as a state park, served as a rough precedent; Niagara Falls back in New York, on the other hand, stood as a negative paradigm. Niagara was infamous to anyone who cared about America’s natural majesties, because private operators there had bought up the overlooks and blocked the views, turning that spectacle into a commercial peep show. Yellowstone, as a great public attraction promising to bring visitors and money westward, would be different.Congress embraced what the Northern Pacific, Ferdinand Hayden, and others had proposed, and on March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant, compliant but no great advocate of scenic protection himself, signed a bill creating the world’s first national park. That law, not surprisingly for its time, ignored any prior claims by the Sheep Eater or other native groups. It specified “a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” meaning implicitly non-Indian people. Within this park “wanton destruction of the fish and game,” whatever “wanton” might mean, as well as commercial exploitation of such game, was prohibited. The boundaries were rectilinear, although ecology isn’t. The paradox had been framed.At the outset, the park was an orphan idea with no clarity of purpose, no staff, no budget. Congress seemed to lose interest as soon as the ink of Grant’s signature dried. Yellowstone became a disaster zone, neglected and abused, for more than a decade. Nathaniel Langford, the failed bank clerk and railroad publicist, served as its first superintendent, at zero salary, and during his five years in the post he barely earned that, revisiting the park only two or three times. Market hunters established themselves brazenly in the park, killing elk, bison, bighorn sheep, and other ungulates in industrial quantities. By one account, a pair called the Bottler brothers shot about 2,000 elk near Mammoth Hot Springs in early 1875, generally taking only the tongue and the hide from each animal, leaving the carcasses to rot or be scavenged. That account doesn’t say how many grizzly bears the Bottlers killed over those carcasses, for convenience or profit, but undoubtedly the elk meat was a dangerous attractant that brought bears near guns. An elk hide was worth six to eight dollars, serious money, and a man might kill 25 to 50 elk in a day. “There was this massive slaughter that occurred here, from 1871 through at least 1881,” according to Lee Whittlesey, currently Yellowstone’s historian. Antlers littered the hillsides. Wagon tourists came and went unsupervised, at low numbers but with relatively high impact, some of them vandalizing geyser cones, carving their names on the scenery, killing a trumpeter swan or other wildlife for the hell of it. Ungulate populations fell, and then the carnage gradually petered out, Whittlesey told me, “until the Army arrived here in 1886.”As an act of desperation, in the absence of any congressional appropriation for managing Yellowstone or any trained body of park police to enforce its rules, the secretary of the interior in 1886 asked the U.S. Army to take over. And with that event, an unlikely hero enters the story: Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.Philip Sheridan is best known, and most infamously remembered, as a ruthless cavalry leader under Grant during the Civil War and, later, as commander of the horrific military campaigns against the Plains Indians. He advocated exterminating the buffalo as a means of crushing tribal cultures and resistance. But after he visited Yellowstone in 1882, a more appealing side of Sheridan’s character emerged. In this very different context, he deplored the slaughter of “our noble game,” evidently even the bison, and offered troops to prevent it. He also was appalled that a commercial monopoly on visitor services had been granted to the so-called Yellowstone Park Improvement Company, a new entity closely allied with the Northern Pacific Railroad. “I regretted exceedingly to learn,” he reported to Washington, “that the national park had been rented out to private parties.” And he made one radically percipient observation: Congress had made the park too small.Returning to Washington, Sheridan led a campaign by sportsmen and sympathetic lawmakers to extend Yellowstone’s boundaries by 40 miles along the east side and 10 miles along the south. That would have increased the park area by 2.1 million acres, almost doubling its size. More crucially, it would have added adjacent lowlands to which elk and other ungulates migrate in winter.Carried into Congress by Senator George G. Vest of Missouri, the Sheridan proposal failed. The boundaries stood. Those boundaries were tweaked in the 1920s and 1930s, to reflect stream drainages rather than abstract linearity. But the need for safe winter range by big herbivores—especially elk and bison—remained a festering problem, and it still festers today.Yellowstone nowadays is a great sanctum for wild animals. The wolf is back. The grizzly bear population has rebounded since a perilous nadir in the 1970s, now filling areas of the ecosystem, including Grand Teton National Park, where it hadn’t been seen in decades. The beaver has recovered from a long decline. The bison is secure, reproducing only too well, and spilling out beyond the park boundaries. Efforts have been made to protect the crucial migration corridors of the American pronghorn. Elk are abundant but not so overabundant as during the decades when they lived free of wolf predation. Bald eagles are doing well. By these measures, Yellowstone is a magnificently effective wildlife refuge.It wasn’t always so. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, predatory animals suffered ruthless persecution within Yellowstone Park, both as a matter of neglect (while poaching was rampant) and as a matter of ill-conceived policy. The very idea that the park should protect wildlife as well as geysers and canyons was an afterthought, initially applied only to the “good” creatures, the game animals that hunters prized, the trout that fishermen wanted, the benign herbivores that visitors could comfortably admire, such as elk and deer, pronghorn and moose, bison and bighorn sheep. Although the U.S. Army had assumed custodianship of the park, it wasn’t until passage of the Lacey Act in 1894—an act “to protect the birds and animals in Yellowstone National Park, and to punish crimes in said park”—that Yellowstone’s caretakers had authority to arrest and prosecute poachers. The Lacey Act helped both the Army and then the National Park Service (established in 1916) protect Yellowstone wildlife, but it came almost too late for the bison.By 1901 only a few hundred bison remained in America, about two dozen of which had found refuge in the Pelican Valley, a remote drainage northeast of Yellowstone Lake. Park officials managed to save those few, breed them with captive bison brought from ranches elsewhere, and eventually create a bison-ranching operation in the Lamar Valley—straightforwardly called the Buffalo Ranch—with its animals ranging free during summer and herded back in autumn, to spend winter in corrals eating hay. Another instance of the cultivated wild. The merits of the Buffalo Ranch were questionable from an ecological perspective, but as a reaction to the scare over bison extinction it was understandable. The ranch operated until 1952.Horace Albright, superintendent of Yellowstone from 1919 to 1929, worried that America’s elk might also face extinction, because of uncontrolled slaughter outside the park and the harsh winters they faced on the Yellowstone Plateau. Albright is remembered fondly, but his legacy, like Sheridan’s, is ambivalent. He had served as a young assistant to Stephen Mather, the man chiefly responsible for creating the National Park Service, and he shared Mather’s commitment to raising Yellowstone’s value, and that of the national parks system generally, by increasing tourism. Large, visible herds of elk represented popular attractions, so Albright wanted them—even at the expense of other native Yellowstone animals. He instituted a program of feeding hay to elk during winter, hoping to keep them from migrating out of the park and into danger from hunters, and he encouraged his rangers to kill predators. Sport fishing was another visitor draw, so white pelicans, those nefarious trout-eaters, were suppressed by crushing eggs and killing hatchlings at their breeding colonies.Persecution of the “bad” animals in Yellowstone dated back to well before Albright. Predators had been shot, trapped, and poisoned since the 1870s. One superintendent even encouraged commercial trappers to kill beavers by the hundreds, so that they wouldn’t build dams and flood his park. Otters were classified as predatory, that damning label, and for a while there was a fatwa against skunks. During the Army years noncommissioned officers and civilian scouts were “authorized and directed to kill mountain lions, coyotes, and timber wolves,” by order of the secretary of the interior. Wolf killing ended only when the wolves were all gone, not just from Yellowstone (by around 1930) but throughout the American West. Poisoning and shooting of coyotes continued until about 1935. But bears were different.Bears were omnivorous and, as some people saw them, cute. They were also smart and opportunistic. Beginning as early as 1883, they adjusted to feeding on food refuse from garbage dumps near the park hotels, and that behavior made them easily visible and therefore a popular tourist attraction. They also learned to accept handouts from passing visitors, a trend that started in the stagecoach era and continued after private automobiles were allowed into the park, beginning in 1915. Albright himself encouraged the handouts game, leading people to think that bears—even grizzlies—were companionable, benign, and feckless. By the hotels at Old Faithful, on the lake, and near the Grand Canyon, the dumps became theaters where tourists sat on bleacher seats to watch the “bear show” on summer evenings. For 80 years Yellowstone’s grizzlies and black bears consumed humans’ garbage in enormous quantities, coming to depend on it unwholesomely, with the blessings of the park managers and to the amusement of the visiting public. “One of the duties of the National Park Service,” Albright wrote, after succeeding Mather as head of the service in 1929, “is to present wild life ‘as a spectacle.’ This can only be accomplished where game is abundant and where it is tame.”But the grizzlies of Yellowstone were never tame.Photographs and paintings of sights such as this—the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone—inspired Congress to create the park in 1872. It was a revolutionary step.Read part two of this story: Beyond the Yellowstone Tourists See, a Daily Struggle of Life and DeathIn a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"On August 7, 2015, a ranger found the chewed-upon body of a man near a hiking trail in Yellowstone National Park, not far from one of the park’s largest hotels. The deceased was soon identified as Lance Crosby, 63, from Billings, Montana. He had worked seasonally as a nurse at a medical clinic in the park and been reported missing by co-workers that morning.Investigation revealed that Crosby was hiking alone on the previous day, without bear spray, and ran afoul of a female grizzly with two cubs. The sow, after killing and partially eating him (not necessarily in that order), and allowing the cubs to eat too, cached his remains beneath dirt and pine duff, as grizzlies do when they intend to reclaim a piece of meat. Once trapped and persuasively linked to Crosby by DNA evidence, she was given a sedative and an anesthetic and then executed, on grounds that an adult grizzly bear that has eaten human flesh and cached a body is too dangerous to be spared, even if the fatal encounter wasn’t her fault. “We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim,” said Park Superintendent Dan Wenk, a reasonable man charged with a difficult task: keeping Yellowstone safe for both people and wildlife.Grizzly bears, clearly, can be dangerous animals. But the danger they represent should be seen in perspective. Lance Crosby’s death was just the seventh bear-caused fatality in the park during the past hundred years. In the 144 years since Yellowstone was established, more people have died there of drowning and of scalding in thermal pools, and of suicide, than have been killed by bears. Almost as many people have died from lightning strikes. Two people have been killed by bison.The real lesson inherent in the death of Lance Crosby, and in the equally regrettable death of the bear that killed him, is a reminder of something too easily forgotten: Yellowstone is a wild place, constrained imperfectly within human-imposed limits. It’s filled with wonders of nature—fierce animals, deep canyons, scalding waters—that are magnificent to behold but fretful to engage.Most of us, when we visit Yellowstone, gaze from our cars at a roadside bear, stand at an overlook above a great river, stroll boardwalks amid the geyser basins. We experience the park as a diorama. But walk just 200 yards off the road into a forested gully or a sagebrush flat, and you had better be carrying, as Lance Crosby wasn’t, a canister of bear spray. This is the paradox of Yellowstone, and of most other national parks we have added since: wilderness contained, nature under management, wild animals obliged to abide by human rules. It’s the paradox of the cultivated wild.Question: Can we hope to preserve, in the midst of modern America, any such remnant of our continent’s primordial landscape, any such sample of true wildness—a gloriously inhospitable place, full of predators and prey, in which nature is still allowed to be red in tooth and claw? Can that sort of place be reconciled with human demands and human convenience? Time alone, and our choices, will tell. But if the answer is yes, the answer is Yellowstone.On March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant, compliant but no great advocate of scenic protection himself, signed a bill creating the world’s first national park. That law specified “a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.” Within this park “wanton destruction of the fish and game,” whatever “wanton” might mean, as well as commercial exploitation of such game, was prohibited. The boundaries were rectilinear, although ecology isn’t. The paradox had been framed.At the outset, the park was an orphan idea with no clarity of purpose, no staff, no budget. Congress seemed to lose interest as soon as the ink of Grant’s signature dried. The idea that the park should protect wildlife as well as geysers and canyons was an afterthought. Yellowstone became a disaster zone. Market hunters operated brazenly in the park, killing elk, bison, bighorn sheep, and other ungulates in industrial quantities, until the U.S. Army was brought in to handle enforcement. An elk hide was worth six to eight dollars, serious money, and a man might kill 25 to 50 elk in a day. Antlers littered the hillsides. Wagon tourists came and went unsupervised, at low numbers but with relatively high impact, some of them vandalizing geyser cones, carving their names on the scenery, killing a trumpeter swan or other wildlife for the hell of it.Even after the National Park Service replaced the Army in 1916, persecution of the “bad” animals in the park—meaning mostly the predators, as distinct from the gentle herbivores—continued unfettered. One superintendent even encouraged commercial trappers to kill beavers by the hundreds, so that they wouldn’t build dams and flood his park. Otters were classified as predatory, that damning label, and for a while there was a fatwa against skunks. Wolf killing ended only when the wolves were all gone, not just from Yellowstone (by around 1930) but throughout the American West. Poisoning and shooting of coyotes continued until about 1935.Bears, especially grizzly bears (though black bears are also present), have always been a different and more complicated matter. Grizzlies are omnivores, smart and opportunistic. From the early years of the park, they learned to accept handouts from passing travelers and to forage on humans’ garbage. Later, by the hotels at Old Faithful, on the lake, and near the Grand Canyon, large garbage dumps became theaters where tourists sat on bleacher seats to watch the “bear show” on summer evenings. For 80 years, Yellowstone’s grizzlies and black bears consumed food refuse in vast quantities, coming to depend on it unwholesomely, with the blessings of the park managers and to the amusement of the visiting public. The closure of those dumps during the early 1970s, when management ideas shifted toward more “natural” regulation, precipitated a crisis of hungry desperation among grizzlies that brought the population way down and resulted, in 1975, in the bear’s listing as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act.Today Yellowstone is the eponym of a great ecosystem, the biggest and richest complex of mostly untamed landscape and wildlife within the lower 48 states. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is an amoeboid expanse of landscape encompassing two national parks (Grand Teton is the second) as well as national forests, wildlife refuges, and other public and private holdings, the whole shebang amounting to 22.6 million acres, an order of magnitude bigger than Yellowstone Park itself. Surrounding this great amoeba is a modest transition zone, where you will more likely find cattle than elk, more likely see a grain elevator than a grizzly bear, and more likely hear the bark of a black Labrador than the howl of a wolf. Bounding that buffer is 21st-century America: highways, towns, parking lots, malls, endlessly sprawling suburbs, golf courses, Starbucks.Within the ecosystem, everything is connected. That’s the first lesson not just of ecology but also of resource politics. The wolf is connected to the grizzly bear by way of their competition for ungulate prey, especially elk calves and adult elk that have been weakened by winter or the rigors of the autumn rut. Because whitebark pine seeds constitute another important food for grizzlies, the bears are connected to the mountain pine beetle, which kills the pines in increasingly severe outbreaks related to climate change. Bison are connected to Montana livestock policy by way of a disease called brucellosis, probably brought to America in cattle.Multiple surgeries restored Nic Patrick’s face but couldn’t erase the scars left by the grizzly that mauled him in 2013 at his Wyoming ranch, along the South Fork of the Shoshone River. A conservationist as well as a cattleman, Patrick holds no grudge: The mother bear was only protecting her cubs, he says. Watch as Nic Patrick describes the attack.Such interconnections underscore the truth of a truism: that the ecosystem is an intricate, interactive compoundment of living creatures, relationships, physical factors, geological circumstances, historical accidents, and biological processes. The changes that ricochet through these networks of connection, from animal to plant, predator to prey, one level of the food web to another, are a focus of interest, and disagreement, among scientists who study the wildlife and vegetation of Yellowstone. The details become almost Talmudic in complexity, but what’s important to keep in mind is that disturbances have secondary effects, usually unforeseen, and that sometimes those effects are irreversible. Restoring wolves to Yellowstone, for example, does not necessarily fix all the problems that removing wolves from Yellowstone caused. Taking grizzlies off the list of threatened species will have consequences down the road too.Preservation of the grizzly bear population is arguably the highest and best purpose of Yellowstone Park and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. But that doesn’t oblige one to extreme pessimism over the bear’s prospects of survival, nor to distrust of agency biologists, many of whom believe that the bear’s intelligence and flexibility of behavior will keep it robust and numerous despite changes in the landscape that require greater reliance on some different foods. After all, they say, the grizzly is an omnivore, and although some of its traditionally most used food sources are in decline—spawning cutthroat trout, whitebark pine seeds—because of human-caused impacts on the ecosystem, there are 264 other choices on the known list of grizzly dietary items in Yellowstone. Change may come, these scientists say, but the bear will adapt to the challenge.For the people who live within it, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a focus of many hopes, ideals, and fond memories—but also of many angers, in part because it contains so many different expectations governed by different interests. Some hunters are angry that there aren’t enough elk. Some ranchers are angry that there are too many elk. Some wolf lovers are angry that wolves, including those that spend much of their year within the park, now may be hunted or trapped when they roam beyond the park boundaries. Some landowners in Gardiner, Montana, are angry that bison migrate out of the park in winter and into their yards. Some stockmen are angry that migrating bison carry brucellosis, which might be passed to their cows. Some wildlife activists are angry that bison from the park, once they migrate out, may be corralled and shipped to slaughter. Some range scientists are angry about overgrazed grasslands in the two parks, resulting from too many bison and elk. Some fishermen are angry about the slaughter of lake trout, an exotic species that’s being suppressed in Yellowstone Lake for the sake of the native cutthroat trout. Somebody somewhere is probably angry about coyotes. Scarcely a season passes, in the gateway towns of Cody and Jackson and Bozeman, without several public meetings, called by the various agencies, at which people express these angers.Amid that push and pull, however, one important truth must be remembered: that the people who live and work and hunt and fish and hike within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are not the sole possessors of legitimate interest.This is America’s place, and the world’s.Have we vastly improved this great area since the bad old days of commercial poaching and vandalism, governmental neglect, Wild West brigandage, and uncontrolled tourism development—or have we already gone a long way toward making it a big, boring suburb with antler-motif doorknobs?Passionately dedicated people need to find collaborative solutions and to recognize that righteous intransigence is not a strategy; it’s just a satisfying attitude. The various agency members of the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee (the body that tries to oversee the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem as a comprehensive entity) need to add private groups as partners and to make bold decisions that transcend turf politics. Climate change seems to be hurting Yellowstone—by way of temperature ranges, insect cycles, drought, who knows what else—and we all need to do better on fixing that.Ha, easier said than done. But if the Yellowstone grizzly bear is expected to adapt, modify its behavior, and cope with new realities, shouldn’t we be expected to do that too?In a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"Tom Miner Basin, north of Yellowstone National Park, is home to ranch land and also to predators that travel in and out of the park. Hilary Anderson cuts a classic figure riding the range above the family ranch, but her purpose is practical: to deter predators by keeping cattle bunched and by showing a human presence on the land.Just a few miles south of Bozeman, Montana, in the rolling foothills of the Gallatin Range, spacious dream homes pepper the landscape. Forty years ago, wapiti, the Shawnee name for elk, poured out of the mountains in December and spent winters grazing in farmers’ alfalfa fields.Today an ever expanding human footprint weighs on these hills, as it does on many corners of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where public and private lands intersect. The Greater Yellowstone’s 22.6 million acres include both Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, plus national forests, wildlife refuges, and surrounding chunks of 21st-century America: highways, towns, parking lots, malls, and suburbs.Dennis Glick, founder of conservation group Future West, assesses the scene.For the second half of the 20th century, he, like many U.S. conservationists, believed that if anything would destroy the integrity of Yellowstone and neighboring lands, it would be the noose of natural resource extraction tightening around the national park’s borders.Becky Weed and her husband, David Tyler, make every effort to live peacefully within their environment, recognizing the important roles of both farms and native predators in conservation.Bill Hoppe’s Montana ranch overlooks the park. Elk, bison, wolves, and grizzly bears migrate across his land, and he makes part of his living guiding elk hunts. He protested the reintroduction of wolves, claiming they would devastate elk herds.Hard-rock mining, conservationists believed, would foul the rivers. Oil and natural gas wells would fragment wildlife habitat; industrial-strength logging would lay waste to national forests; and livestock grazing on public lands would cause conflicts with grizzly bears, wolves, and other predators.But Greater Yellowstone survived the era of natural resource extraction that swept across the West for a century. Ask Glick now to identify the most ominous threats facing the ecosystem, and he doesn’t hesitate. “Number one would be the effects of climate change: droughts, big wildfires, and diseases that were never here before.”But close on the heels of climate change is people.“It isn’t that we are behaving callously,” he says. “Humankind may very well be loving this place to death.”This band of 1,400 sheep spends the summer grazing season in the Gravelly Range of Montana. They’re tended by three ranchers along with a sheepherder and two Akbash guard dogs. Constant vigilance replaces bullets as a way of deterring predators that live in and around Yellowstone.Visitors from around the world are swarming to the region in record numbers. Last year both Yellowstone and Grand Teton set visitation records, and they are expected to shatter those marks again in 2016. Meanwhile waves of others summoned by an instinct to live closer to nature—“lifestyle pilgrims,” as Glick calls them—are leaving cities and relocating to Greater Yellowstone.“Greater Yellowstone management is on the map for doing things right,” Glick says, “protecting big pieces of public land so it now supports every major mammal species that was here before Columbus arrived on the continent.” But how people develop a few million acres of private land has huge implications for the ecological integrity of public land and the wildlife that depends on it.As long as adjacent private lands remain open and undeveloped, species can survive. For example, nine major elk herds pass through Greater Yellowstone on epic migrations. Although they spend a majority of their time on public land, they also spend crucial winter months on private ranches.A state wildlife manager in Cody, Wyoming, checks on a problem grizzly that’s been tranquilized so it can be relocated away from people. Wyoming and other states around Yellowstone argue that grizzlies, still protected on the “threatened” list under the Endangered Species Act, have recovered enough for trophy hunting to be allowed.Back in the day, Glick says, most population growth in this region occurred in existing communities or, if in rural areas, remained tucked into draws out of the wind or above the floodplain. “Nowadays,” he says, “rural sprawl has been the dominant development pattern, and it has ripple effects for public lands.”Andy Hansen, a conservation biologist and professor at Montana State University, points out—in a study due to be published this summer—that the number of private land tracts with no homes or few homes is declining. And the number of parcels with one home per 40 acres increased 328 percent from 1970 to 2010, he says.By 2013, 30 percent of Greater Yellowstone was considered “developed,” and some wildlife migration pathways were believed to be imperiled. By 2020, between 5 and 40 percent of the ecosystem’s most biologically rich habitats will undergo conversion from ranch and farmland to exurban development.Today Yellowstone and Grand Teton, plus Glacier National Park, located along the U.S. border with Canada, are the only national parks in the lower 48 states that support populations of three major North American predators: grizzlies, wolves, and mountain lions. In Yellowstone and Grand Teton this success is due to the parks’ good neighbors: surrounding private lands that support habitat for the prey species—elk, deer, and pronghorn—that the predators eat.But over time the severing of corridors will likely contribute to a decline in migratory elk, mule deer, and pronghorn populations inside the national parks.People are also pushing deeper into grizzly habitat, causing conflicts that typically result in bears being removed or killed. And climate change, a looming wild card, is expected to reduce the carrying capacity of public lands, making private lands on the periphery of Greater Yellowstone all the more important.In recent decades local land trusts have protected important parcels of private land through conservation easements. But the process isn’t keeping up with the rate at which land is being steadily fragmented.Foresighted federal environmental laws preserved Yellowstone and the national forests. But protecting private lands requires a different kind of thinking. And at a time when anti-regulation sentiments serve as an obstacle to community planning in the West, the coming decades will be critical.In the long term what will save Greater Yellowstone from experiencing the same fate as most other regions in the lower 48? “I’ll say it in one word: ‘restraint,’” Glick says. “In 1872 the creation of Yellowstone National Park was an exhibition of restraint against the prevailing forces of Manifest Destiny, and we are reaping huge benefits. What’s going to save Greater Yellowstone comes down to the same ethic. But I’m sorry to say I’m not seeing much of that these days. If we are going to act, the time is now.”Four-year-old Elle Anderson chases a ball and a future near her family’s house on J Bar L Ranch in Montana. “A hundred years from now,” says Hilary Anderson, “I hope this place is a thriving ecosystem full of everything that should be here—wolves, bears, humans, livestock.”In a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"In 1995 and 1996, some 70 years after Yellowstone’s last wolf howled its last howl, 31 wolves from western Canada were released from acclimation pens across the park. They took hold of the landscape, they proliferated, they thrived in the park, and spread throughout the region. Another 35 wolves were released in central Idaho at about the same time. Twenty years later roughly 500 wolves inhabit the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Thirteen hundred more live elsewhere in the northern Rockies, and the gray wolf—that’s the common name, although individuals vary in color from pale brindle to black—has been removed from endangered species listing in Idaho and Montana. Wolves can now be legally hunted and trapped there. (The Wyoming situation is more complicated.) Today about a hundred wolves, constituting ten packs, live primarily within Yellowstone National Park, where Doug Smith, head of the Yellowstone Wolf Project, leads the effort to monitor, manage, and protect them.On a cold December morning at an airport near Gardiner, Montana, just north of the park, I buckled into the back of a cherry-red Hughes 500D helicopter beside Smith for a glimpse of the project in action. Smith has worked with wolves for 37 years, with Yellowstone’s since their reintroduction, and has handled more than 500 individuals while they were tranquilized for collaring. He’s a tall man with a gray handlebar mustache and crow’s-feet that pinch around his smiling eyes. Seconds after we were securely aboard, the chopper levitated and then plunged toward the Yellowstone River under the touch of Jim Pope, a wildlife-capture pilot with an aerobatic flair. He leveled us off and then climbed again, sweeping south into the park, across the foothills, up over Sepulcher Mountain. Freezing wind ripped through our bubble as the treetops flashed by 200 feet below. Then we set down gently on a clear patch of snow behind Sepulcher. Pope’s crew—a pair of “muggers,” whose job was to fire a charge-propelled net, jump out, and tranquilize captured animals—had already immobilized two wolves.Smith’s colleague Dan Stahler was also there, working with two other biologists on the drugged wolves. Kneeling in the snow, Stahler had almost finished fitting a collar on the bigger animal, a handsome black male, maybe three years old, with a small injury over his right eye. The other was a young female, light gray with a reddish brown head. Wearing purple medical exam gloves on a day that asked for warmer handwear, Stahler drew blood from the male’s right leg, then took a small tissue sample from the right ear for DNA work, while Smith adjusted a collar on the female. Smith measured the male: right front paw, body length, upper canine tooth—a little over an inch for the last. Upper canines are the teeth that show so menacingly when a wolf snarls at an enemy. But Smith called my attention to the carnassials. “Those are shearing teeth,” he said. “You don’t even want to get your fingers in there when they’re drugged,” although that was almost precisely what he was doing. Carnassials are their key teeth, he said—edgy and powerful, for slicing meat, cracking bone.Smith and the team moved quickly. They lifted the male in a sling to weigh him: 55 kilograms, more than 120 pounds. They grabbed a fecal sample and injected a microchip between his shoulder blades. They weighed and measured the female. They took a rectal thermometer reading. Her body temperature had gone a little low, so they put her on a plastic sheet, wrapped her in jackets, and placed chemical hand warmers in her groin area while they finished other work. When they had their data, Smith invited me to kneel in the snow beside the big male and hold up his head for a photo. Cradling the animal gingerly, I noticed that his black fur was highlighted with grizzled and silvery tips. His tongue hung out, limp as a sock. He was groggy and helpless for now, but he was magnificent.“Look at those eyes,” Smith said. They were wide open, blazing a coppery brown. “That’s wild,” he said. “This is what our world is trying to do away with. Right here, that look. We want to keep that look. That’s what Yellowstone Park is all about.”That’s what Yellowstone’s grizzlies are about too. Far from tame, as Horace Albright, that especially influential early park superintendent, wanted them, they are wild animals, powerful and well armed, jealous of their solitude, the females vehemently protective of their young. Lance Crosby’s death in August 2015 serves as only the most recent reminder of that. They’re also voracious—they’ve got to eat. Understanding the Yellowstone grizzly begins with considering its diet, and human flesh is an anomalous item, not even included with balsamroot and stink ant on the list of 266 items in the grizzlies’ diet.There were times in the 1970s and ’80s when the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem held as few as perhaps 140 grizzlies, and the population seemed doomed, says Chris Servheen, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official who coordinates grizzly recovery. Today 700 to 1,000 live there, including these two hulks tangling near the Firehole River.Kerry Gunther, who is Doug Smith’s counterpart as bear-management biologist for the park, spoke about this one afternoon as I sat with him in the backcountry, overlooking a site that doesn’t appear on the tourist maps: an odd, deep little spring that grizzlies sometimes use as a sort of bathtub. We had bushwhacked all morning to get there and eaten our lunches on a small knoll, talking of what Gunther had seen in 30 years of bear study and management in Yellowstone. He’s a quiet man, judicious in his statements, confident in his science, content to let others think what they will think, and dispassionate enough to view bitter disputes in which he and other managers are stuck between critics on both flanks as “interesting.”In the 1980s, Gunther said, “every adult female bear seemed critical to the population. We were still at low population numbers.” Numbers were low because the grizzly population had crashed in the 1970s, after a change in management emphasis away from Albright’s yen for spectacle and toward greater attention to ecology. One signal event influencing that change was the Leopold Report of 1963, a landmark in the evolution of ideas about Yellowstone’s purposes and policies, which came from a review committee chaired by Aldo Leopold’s son Starker, a respected biologist in his own right. The Leopold Report, formally titled “Wildlife Management in the National Parks,” wasn’t the first voice to suggest an ecological approach to parks management—that idea went back to a foresighted animal ecologist named Charles C. Adams in the 1920s—but as a special advisory paper commissioned by the secretary of the interior, Stewart Udall, it carried considerable force. The report stated that conditions in each national park should be “maintained, or where necessary recreated,” so as to represent “a vignette of primitive America,” thereby affirming, but without untangling, the paradox of the cultivated wild. That and other factors—notably the public reaction to two grizzly-caused human fatalities, seemingly unrelated but shockingly coincidental, in a single night in Glacier National Park in August 1967—led to the closure of all Yellowstone dumps.Cutthroat trout, seen here spawning in the Gros Ventre River, are highly prized by anglers. Adapted to cold water, they’re threatened by a warming climate—and in Yellowstone Lake, by non-native lake trout.Young common loon chicks rest on the back of their mother at Yellowstone National Park.North American river otters swim at Ely Springs in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Shutting down that garbage buffet left the bears hungry, dazed by the sudden deprivation, confused, and reckless. They got into trouble, they suffered the consequences, their reproductive rate fell, and their population shrank drastically, to perhaps fewer than 140 throughout the ecosystem. During 1971 alone, more than 40 grizzlies were killed outside the park in various conflicts and mishaps, including bears that had been captured, marked, and released. The Yellowstone grizzly might have died out completely if the decline had continued for a decade.But in 1975 the grizzly bear in the lower 48 was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Hunting of grizzlies ceased, at least as a legal sporting activity in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and the park adopted new policies to protect people from bears and vice versa. “We spent a lot of time managing individual bears, especially females, working really hard to try to keep them alive,” said Gunther, who came to Yellowstone in 1983. That meant forestalling bear-human conflict, by practical measures such as bear-proofing garbage cans and Dumpsters, patrolling campgrounds, educating visitors not to feed bears intentionally and not to allow them to pilfer human foods. The point was to keep humans and grizzlies at a respectful distance from each other and to encourage bear reliance on the natural foods they’d begun rediscovering after the closure of the dumps.It worked. More females survived, they produced more cubs, “and the population has really turned around,” Gunther said. Grizzly numbers increased within the park, and their distributional range increased too, with bears now turning up in peripheral parts of the ecosystem where they hadn’t been seen in decades. Grizzly bears are hard to count, but the latest estimate from the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, in just the core area of the ecosystem (they call it the Demographic Monitoring Area), and using an arcane mathematical model to extrapolate, puts that population at 717 bears. In the entire ecosystem, Gunther said, “I think we could easily be up around a thousand.” Based on such numbers, on the trend over recent decades, and on their belief that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is now about as full of grizzly bears as it can be, many of the state and federal bear biologists suggest that it’s time to remove the Yellowstone grizzly from the list of threatened species.This is controversial. Everything about the grizzly is controversial. Some conservationists outside the agency circle have challenged the population estimates, the positive prognosis, and the advisability of delisting. They’re concerned about the likely effects of renewed sport hunting and the long-term food security of the Yellowstone population.Although that list of grizzly food items is extensive and diverse, just a few of the 266 deliver far more caloric intake than any others: cutthroat trout from Yellowstone Lake at spawning time, ungulate meat, whitebark pine nuts, and an unusual insect that aggregates in Yellowstone’s high country, the army cutworm moth (Euxoa auxiliaris). Each of those is an intricate story within the big saga.The cutthroat trout is the only trout native to Yellowstone waters. Rainbow trout, browns, brookies, and lake trout are all exotics, brought in since the park was established. Yellowstone Lake was a stronghold for the Yellowstone subspecies of cutthroat, the lake’s feeder streams offering shallow, well-oxygenated waters where it could spawn. Kerry Gunther’s first job at Yellowstone, as a fishery technician, involved monitoring cutthroat spawners in Clear Creek, one of the major lake tributaries, where he remembers a count of around 32,000 cutthroat spawners in one spring and early summer, all clambering into the shallows to mix their sperm and eggs in gravelly spawning beds. Grizzlies, black bears, coyotes, and other predators made good use of this easy food source. The first grizzly that Gunther ever saw was a big, dark-colored bear he encountered while snowshoeing in at the start of May 1983 to count spawning cutthroat. Being on snowshoes was no doubt a good reminder that you should never try to run from a grizzly. By 2006 the season’s count at Clear Creek had declined to 489 fish, less than a hundredth of the former number—therefore less than a hundredth the fat and protein available to bears fishing there. The decline continued, and spawning-fish counts in other tributaries around the lake have fallen almost to zero. Three factors, in deadly combination, account for this collapse: prolonged drought, especially affecting the tributaries; an ailment called whirling disease, caused by a parasite new to the system; and most important, the presence of lake trout, brought originally from the Midwest.Lake trout arrived in Yellowstone Lake some decades ago, secretly introduced, presumably by a witless sportsman meaning to enhance the park fishery. They survived, they spawned, their population grew, but the alarm bell didn’t ring until 1994, when a fisherman on Yellowstone Lake caught a 17-inch lake trout. “Then everybody kind of had heart attacks,” said Pat Bigelow, a fishery biologist at Yellowstone. “Because it was pretty well known that the lake trout is a voracious predator.”And a tough competitor. The big, adult lake trout in Yellowstone ate the smaller cutthroat trout and fingerlings, and before long the cutthroat population was a ghost of its former self. This was not just a trade of one trout kind for another, but a drastic shift in where the trout flesh resides. Whereas cutthroat trout hang shallow, often eating winged insects from the water’s surface or leeches and other small invertebrates in those shallows, lake trout tend to lurk in the deep, feeding on invertebrates also, or other fish, and usually doing their spawning down there, rather than running up into the tributaries. So they are far less available to bears, and their replacement of cutthroat trout represents a severe loss for those grizzlies that once feasted at spawning streams.Bigelow came to Yellowstone from Vermont in 1979, as a member of the Young Adult Conservation Corps, and she remembers seeing fishermen on Yellowstone Lake catch and release 50 cutthroat in a day. That doesn’t happen anymore. The catch for cutthroat is down, and if you fish there today and catch a lake trout, park regulations require that you kill it.A magpie mobs a group of river otters on the Snake River, Grand Teton National Park. Magpies follow otters in winter, attempting to scavenge leftover bits of fish.A weasel blends into snow in Grand Teton. In spring it will molt and turn light brown. Cutthroat trout, seen here spawning in the Gros Ventre River, are highly prized by anglers. Adapted to cold water, they’re threatened by a warming climate—and in Yellowstone Lake, by non-native lake trout.But sportsmen will never solve this problem. Bigelow showed me, during a long, fishy morning aboard a large, steel boat on Yellowstone Lake, how the park is trying to cope with it wholesale: by contracting a company from Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan, to bring Great Lakes–style commercial fishing methods to the task of exterminating lake trout. For most of five hours I stood beside her, wearing orange vinyl overalls, rubber boots, and a life jacket, like everyone else. The gill nets coming up held large, greenish gray fish—four pounds, five pounds, two feet long—that could be considered beautiful animals if only they weren’t exotics causing such harm to an ecosystem. I watched Bigelow and the boat crewmen wrestle these fish from the nets, measure them, count them, then slit them open with sharp knives, check for eggs, puncture the air bladders, toss them gasping and dying into plastic tubs, and eventually dump them all back into the lake, allowing the nutrients to remain in the system. Our boat had killed and dumped 238 fish by lunchtime, amounting to half a ton of lake trout. Meanwhile three other boats were inflicting similar carnage. The work was gruesome and heartless—and justified, for the sake of not just the Yellowstone cutthroat but also the grizzly.These commercial boats have been working a long season each summer since 2011, and the cutthroat have begun showing modest signs of recovery. But the lake trout may never be extirpated, and so the suppression effort can probably never end. “If it fails,” Bigelow said, “it’ll be because we didn’t try hard enough.”The loss of whitebark pine nuts from the grizzly bear menu is a more complicated concern, lying further beyond human fixing. These fat-rich little morsels—they’re called nuts but are really pine seeds—come to ripeness within cones on the trees, which inhabit the Yellowstone ecosystem only at high elevations, above 8,500 feet. Whitebark pines grow slowly, reaching cone-bearing maturity after 50 years. Grizzly bears get the nuts mainly by raiding cone middens of red squirrels, which store them for winter. Clark’s nutcrackers, gray-and-black birds in the crow family, also harvest the nuts and hoard them buried in little caches of several seeds each, and most new whitebark pines grow from nutcracker caches that have gone unrecovered by the birds.The greatest enemy of the whitebark pine is the mountain pine beetle, a tiny bullet-shaped insect that burrows tunnels in a tree’s living tissue, which can interrupt nutrient flow and kill the tree. Whitebark forests have always suffered episodic attacks by mountain pine beetles, but in recent years the beetle kill has gotten much worse, probably because of climate change. Severely cold weather, especially deep cold snaps that occur early in winter or late in spring, can knock down the beetle population. But that sort of weather is now rare, and since 2003 a vast beetle outbreak in the Yellowstone ecosystem has resulted in unprecedented killing of whitebark pines.“The whole defensive strategy of the whitebark is escape,” said Jesse Logan, a forest entomologist, as we stood amid a grove of whitebarks in the Absaroka Range. “It’s a hell of a survivor. But it’s not much of a competitor.” At high elevations, in cold and harsh conditions, it largely escapes competition from other conifers—ponderosa pine, lodgepole, Douglas fir. But it doesn’t escape the beetle, not anymore.Logan’s aerial surveys, done with William Macfarlane, a colleague from Utah State University, suggest that almost half the whitebark distribution in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has now suffered severe mortality from the mountain pine beetle, and 82 percent has suffered at least moderate die-offs. Logan pulled some bark off a dead tree to show me the beetles’ tunnels, vertical and crisscrossing, like a subway map of New York City. “My sense is that the loss of this food resource is really important to grizzlies,” he said. He’s not a bear biologist, and others disagree, but the issue is serious.Army cutworm moths are more unexpected, more fortuitous in the grizzly bear’s diet, because unlike whitebark nuts and cutthroat trout, they come from elsewhere. These little gray creatures migrate hundreds of miles in early summer from lowland farming areas—on the Great Plains and in the intermountain West, where in the larval stage they’re crop pests—to high elevations in the Absarokas and elsewhere. They spend the hot days hunkering in cool, moist recesses amid scree slopes (fields of broken, tumbled rocks) above 9,000 feet, and at night they fly out to drink nectar from wildflowers in alpine meadows. Metabolizing the nectar, they lay on rich stores of fat, enough to see them through their arduous return migration in the fall back to crop fields in Kansas, Nebraska, or wherever. A moth that arrives in the mountains in late June, having 40 percent body fat or less, can increase to 65 percent fat or possibly more by the end of the summer. Lapping up such creatures from amid the scree, for a grizzly bear, is like eating pill capsules filled with olive oil by the handful. A grizzly can consume about 40,000 moths in a day, representing about 20,000 calories, which makes the moths ideal food during the hyperphagia period of the bear’s year, when it’s fattening itself for winter hibernation. At that rate a grizzly feeding for 30 days on army cutworm moths can satisfy almost half its yearly energy needs.One of those moth sites lies on the northwest face of a mountain high above a beautiful little basin near the headwaters of the North Fork of the Shoshone River. On a cool day in late August, Mark Bruscino, formerly chief of large-carnivore management for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, led a small group of us to the site, seven hours by horse into the North Absaroka Wilderness. Our packtrain had been assembled by Lee Livingston, an outfitter and county commissioner out of Cody, who rode caboose. We made camp in a glade, drank some whiskey, ate well, and awoke the next morning to find that a small, late summer storm had covered the higher slopes with a thin blanket of snow. We stood at spotting scopes all morning, watching seven grizzlies work their way across the whiteness of a scree slope far above. The bears were burly and dark, their paths turning scree brown against the white as each bear tossed aside 40-pound rocks, digging down, slurping moths, moving slowly on. For a while I watched one grizzly, his huge butt protruding in the air as he dug, rummaged, snarfed, and then occasionally lifted his head, as though to take a breath and swallow. Not far from him, a female and two cubs also fed, tolerating the male at what would be unacceptably close proximity (because male grizzlies sometimes kill cubs and eat them) under other circumstances. But they were all preoccupied now, gobbling moths, acquiring fat.So far this year, Bruscino told me, his old colleagues had counted about 200 individual grizzlies working dozens of moth sites. That’s about a fifth or a quarter of the ecosystem’s grizzly population, he reckoned, all feeding on moths while they’re available. His arithmetic assumed, as did Gunther’s, about a thousand grizzly bears—a huge rise since the nadir of the 1970s. “To me,” he said, “this is one of the greatest wildlife-restoration stories ever.”The grizzly still faces threats, Bruscino noted, but the worst is not the loss of whitebark pines nor of cutthroat trout. It’s not that the moths might disappear or become poisonous if farmers in Kansas decide to use more pesticides. “The biggest long-term threat to this bear population is private-lands development,” he said.A month earlier I had ridden over a pass elsewhere in the Absarokas, southwest of Cody, to meet a young ecologist named Arthur Middleton, who was hard at work in the remote Thorofare area outside the park’s southern boundary, tracing the intricate migrations of Yellowstone elk. My guide this time was Wes Livingston, Lee’s brother, another backcountry horseman who grew up in these mountains and knew every creek and trail. Livingston wore a camo T-shirt, a droopy mustache, an elk-tooth necklace, a weathered felt hat that didn’t even bother to look cowboy, and a titanium .44 Magnum on his belt, in case he needed to shoot an injured horse or mule. He led a string of five pack mules and an extra horse, as I followed him up a long switchback trail toward Deer Creek Pass.It was late July, but nearing the top, we faced a dicey stretch where the narrow trail still lay buried beneath a drift of old snow. Off the left side was a steep plunge toward Deer Creek far below. Livingston stampeded his animals across, their hooves postholing into the snow, their momentum carrying them through. As I tried to follow, my horse—a steady buckskin named Jimbo—balked, floundered, and got himself turned. “Get off!” Livingston hollered, then coached me to grab Jimbo’s lead rope and walk him back onto the dirt to regain his footing. I followed instructions, and eventually we all got across.At the top of the pass we noticed a scoop shovel, stashed there for the use of snowbound hunters. Then the trail tipped down gently into a wide, meadowy valley on the Thorofare side, and Livingston laconically declared, out loud but to himself, “Didn’t roll any donkeys down the mountain.” I wasn’t sure whether “any donkeys” referred to the mules, the horses, or me.We joined Middleton at his camp near the mouth of Open Creek, from which he would range up into the high meadows in search of summering elk. The following morning, over a campfire breakfast, he talked of elk dynamics. The northern herd in Yellowstone Park is famous, he said, for its fluctuations between excessive abundance and relative scarcity, due partly to natural factors, including now again wolf predation, and increased bear predation, and partly to direct human actions. That’s the herd most familiar to visitors, thanks to its conspicuousness along roadsides from the Hayden Valley to the grassy lawns around Yellowstone’s headquarters buildings at Mammoth Hot Springs. The other herds probably haven’t experienced such drastic fluctuations, for reasons that vary by herd and might include open terrain, long sight lines against predators, strong winds that blow away snow, and the animosity of private landowners toward wolves.There was history behind this. The massive slaughter in the late 19th century took elk numbers way down, but then came an elk boom that increased under Horace Albright’s protection, and then a policy reversal after elk seemed too abundant, especially on the northern range of the park, resulting in an active elk-reduction program that lasted from 1934 to 1967. Whipsaw changes. During that long elk-reduction regime, park rangers shot 13,753 elk from the northern herd, private hunters killed 41,400 when the animals migrated out of the park, and almost 7,000 were trapped and shipped away to forests and zoos elsewhere. In the late 1960s the park superintendent and his chief biologist, influenced by the Leopold Report and some fashionable new thinking in ecology, embraced a policy called natural regulation. But what were the limits of “natural” in the service of “regulation”? Was it more natural to let elk starve than to hunt them? Was it more natural to haze bison back into Yellowstone with helicopters, trucks, and rangers on horseback than to ship them to slaughter so that the meat could go to Native American tribes? Hard to say. That fancy phrase “natural regulation” served to codify in two words—but not solve—the paradox of the cultivated wild.As for wolves, reintroducing them was a bold act of management that did restore some “natural” conditions. But how far do those conditions ramify?Attitudes toward the wolf are more bitterly polarized and complex than those around any other creature in Yellowstone. Beyond the wolf-haters-versus-wolf-lovers tussle, scientists disagree about how and to what degree wolves are reshaping the Yellowstone ecosystem. Do they reduce reproductive success among elk simply by creating a landscape of fear, wherein the great bulls and cows are too nervous to eat and procreate? Have wolves killed enough elk to curtail elk browsing on aspen and willow shoots? Has that reduced browsing allowed aspen and willow stands in Yellowstone to recover and renew themselves for the first time in decades? Has such aspen and willow recovery enabled the return of beavers and songbirds? Or is reality a little more intricate? Some scientists and wolf advocates tell this story in happy, simplistic terms. “But it’s an unproven theory that gets undue attention,” Middleton said, “in the quest to have wolves shine rainbows out of their asses.”Middleton is an improbable fit for the role of Wyoming elk maven: a South Carolina kid, a graduate of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, who came west nine years ago, having landed work on a study of elk-wolf interactions commissioned by Wyoming Game and Fish. After arriving in Cody to meet his new collaborator, he admitted that he’d never seen a wolf or an elk. But he learned fast, and he loved the mountains. He put GPS collars on elk, clarifying poorly understood patterns in their movements between summer and winter ranges. He collated similar data from other researchers and made eye-opening digital maps. Look where these animals go. “Most of Yellowstone’s elk,” he said later, “are not in Yellowstone for most of the year.” They’re off the plateau, down on winter range, where the snow isn’t so deep and the temperatures aren’t so brutal, largely on private ranches. By this time Middleton had a Ph.D. from the University of Wyoming and a postdoc position back at Yale. His hair was long, his speech was slow and considered, his brow scrinched when he pondered something carefully. Within a short time at least one Cody-based game warden began referring to him as “the elk hippie.”Middleton’s mapping of the elk data showed at least nine distinct migratory herds, each moving seasonally in a different direction. Many of Grand Teton’s elk winter in the National Elk Refuge, just north of Jackson, Wyoming. Thousands from the other herds move down onto ranches. Along the South Fork of the Shoshone River and in the upper Greybull River Basin, southeast of Cody, many of them winter on historic spreads such as the Pitchfork Ranch and the T E Ranch. From there, in summer, they migrate 50 miles across two difficult passes to reach the verdant highlands above Thorofare Creek, just outside Yellowstone’s southeast corner. That’s why Middleton was here: to find them on their summer range.Several days into our Thorofare trip we rode up out of the valley and camped high, at about 9,200 feet, atop the Thorofare Plateau. The next morning Middleton and I went higher, picking our way through a jackstraw mess of downed timber from the great fires of 1988, our horses stepping carefully over the logs, then onto the easier footing of a meadow, amid the short grasses, the Indian paintbrush, the purple asters. Cresting a ridge, we saw about 150 elk—bulls and cows, some calves—grazing and resting on a green slope in the near distance. From the Cody herd, Middleton said. Part of what he wanted to do here, he explained, was gauge the cow-calf ratio. If 80 percent of the cows had calves in spring, and only 40 percent did now, where did those other calves go? How many had been eaten by grizzlies, how many by wolves?And where would they go in winter if the Pitchfork and the T E and the other big ranches wouldn’t tolerate them? When the alpine grasses go brown, when the frosts hit, when the snow flies, the elk have got to come down from these highlands and all the others to find more clement conditions. But those migrations are in some danger of being choked off—as Mark Bruscino too had warned me—by private land development that turns winter range into vacation homes for the wealthy, sprawling suburbs for the middle class, and commercial areas that serve all sectors of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s growing human population. Many people understand this, at least dimly, but want to own a piece of the scenery anyway. Wes Livingston made the point pungently, as we sat drinking coffee: “It’s called the last-son-of-a-bitch clause. ‘Let me in, and then close the gate.’ ” Blocking the migration corridors, by settlement on lands just outside Yellowstone and Grand Teton, will interrupt an essential flow of ungulates and all the values—nutritional, ecological, aesthetic, financial—they carry.It’s the same basic truth that Gen. Philip Sheridan recognized back in 1882, further illuminated by research such as Middleton’s: Yellowstone’s elk need the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, all of it, and the ecosystem needs Yellowstone’s elk.Livingston had a piece of advice, he told me, for the righteous, out-of-state, vacation-home-owning greenies he sometimes met. If you really want to help Yellowstone wildlife, he would say, “burn your house down and go back to California.”Read part three of this story: Yellowstone's Future Hangs on a Question: Who Owns the West?In a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"Dave Hallac stood in his office at the Yellowstone Center for Resources, the park body charged with science and resource management, in a rambling old clapboard building amid the formidable stone structures of Mammoth Hot Springs. A candid man with an oval face and thinning hair, Hallac was serving his last day as chief of the center—and head scientist at Yellowstone Park—before departing to a promotion elsewhere. His office had the look of farewell when I found him there, between final tasks, his shelves and desk already bare, his books and reports and photographs packed into boxes awaiting removal. He closed the door, which was a little unusual on that open-doored corridor, and as we sat amid the boxes, he repeated to me something he had said passingly a couple months earlier, something so arrestingly blunt that I had asked him to elaborate. “I think we’re losing this place,” he said. “Slowly. Incrementally. In a cumulative fashion.” He hesitated. “I call it a sort of creeping crisis.”Hallac ticked through a list of interrelated concerns, nagging issues in Yellowstone familiar to us both: bison management, elk migration, grizzly bear conservation, private land development in the region surrounding the park, human population growth driving that development, invasive species and their impacts on native species, water use, climate change, and finally the overarching problem that exacerbates all these others—an absence of coordinated, transboundary management. “We go around telling everybody this is the most intact ecosystem in the lower 48,” Hallac said. “Well, if it’s that important, that special, it’s time for us to do a lot better when it comes to protecting it.”This concern about the broader wholeness of the Yellowstone ecosystem, which others share (though not enough others to leverage vigorous action), is now urgent but has been a long time coming. The word “ecosystem” itself didn’t appear in the 1872 act establishing the park, and probably not, either, in any of the emendations or directives about Yellowstone Park that followed for much of a century. The phrase “Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem” may have been first used in Frank Craighead’s 1979 book Track of the Grizzly, an account of the pathbreaking 12-year field study of bears led by him and his twin brother, John. The Craigheads had absorbed, and stated pointedly, a crucial fact: that Yellowstone’s grizzlies live not only within the park’s boundaries (which are unfenced and, throughout most of the landscape, unmarked) but also across a wider terrain that includes Grand Teton National Park, parts of adjacent national forests, and other surrounding lands.Becky Weed and her husband, David Tyler, raise sheep on pastures not treated with chemicals. They ranch with a guard dog to ward off coyotes, bears, and mountain lions.Bill Hoppe’s Montana ranch overlooks the park. Elk, bison, wolves, and grizzlies migrate across his land, and he makes part of his living guiding elk hunts. He protested the reintroduction of wolves, claiming they would devastate elk herds.Jim and Dave Hagenbarth, brothers who own a family ranch in Montana, have dedicated their ranching life to finding new ways to keep agriculture sustainable.Two years later the superintendent of Yellowstone, a percipient man named John Townsley, used that phrase during a friendly chat with Rick Reese, a young mountaineer and educator. “He told me that to treat Yellowstone Park as a box on a map, with no regard for threats to the park from neighboring national forest lands, was absurd,” Reese later wrote. The park and its animal populations, its plants, its waters, even its thermal features, would be affected by what happened outside that box. Paraphrasing Townsley, Reese wrote that the American people “must be educated about these interrelationships and must begin to think in terms of a ‘Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.’ ”Reese served as first president of a new organization, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an alliance of individuals and groups dedicated to conserving the broader wholeness of Yellowstone. Soon afterward, in 1984, he published a book graced with pretty photographs but made influential by serious words, titled Greater Yellowstone: The National Park and Adjacent Wildlands. For a while some of the government people resisted this new term, favoring instead “the Greater Yellowstone Area”—a pusillanimous compromise—possibly because “ecosystem” invoked an interconnectedness that ran against bureaucratic compartmentalization and discomfited those with a jealous sense of turf. But in the years since, even they, except the most cautious, have adopted it.“Yellowstone National Park is not an island,” Reese wrote in that 1984 book, and he was right. But it’s also important to realize that the ecosystem itself is an island in many respects—an ecological island, surrounded by a sea of human impact. It’s isolated landscape. Ravens and eagles may come and go at will, but crossing from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to safe habitat elsewhere is far more problematic for the likes of grizzly bears, elk, and bison. When they step off the island, they generally die.Who’s in charge of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem? Everybody and nobody. There is a deliberative body, the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee, but full membership includes representatives of only the federal agencies (the states, county officials, and private interests participate in subcommittees), and its powers are modest even when its consensus is firm. That’s why Hallac bemoaned the absence of transboundary management in the face of the creeping crisis. “I’m not suggesting in any way that the ecosystem is falling apart,” Hallac told me. “Because it’s not. But it has the potential to. And there are a lot of incremental changes that, I think, are beginning to negatively affect the system.”After half an hour of such conversation, someone knocked on Hallac’s door and peeked in, reminding him that he was due at his own farewell party. He invited me along, but I didn’t want to intrude, preferring to skulk away and consider what he had said. Park managers come and go, even the best of them, but the problems abide.The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is bigger than any other park complex in the lower 48 states. And size matters. A resonant study published in the journal Nature back in 1987, by a young ecologist named William Newmark, revealed that among 12 national parks and park complexes in the western United States, all except two had lost mammal species in the years since they had been established, but that Greater Yellowstone, as the largest, had lost fewer species than almost all others. Most of those local extinctions had resulted not from direct human persecution—as the wolves of Yellowstone had been persecuted to oblivion—but from the natural processes of extinction characteristic of islands: When habitat is constrained within a limited area, animal populations remain small, and small populations tend to wink out, over time, because of accidental factors such as disease, fire, hard weather, and bad luck. Greater Yellowstone had lost less of its mammal diversity by natural attrition than had small parks such as Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Mount Rainier. Its size, evidently, had served it well.Newmark’s original work has been challenged in some particulars during the decades since, but its basic conclusion remains sound: Size matters. The size of the Yellowstone complex helped preserve big, fearsome, wide-ranging, combative animals such as the grizzly, each one of which demands a large territory. No other park in the lower 48, apart from Glacier National Park along Montana’s Canadian border, now supports robust populations of the three greatest living North American carnivores—the grizzly, the wolf, the mountain lion—as well as such other predaceous animals as the wolverine, the coyote, the bobcat, and the red fox. Yellowstone is our wildest park south of the border complex that includes Glacier, in part because it’s our biggest.The other good thing about geographical bigness is that, besides giving space to large predators with broad territorial needs, it usually encompasses habitat diversity as well as sheer space, thereby sheltering a greater variety of creatures at all levels of size, living all modes of life. That truth was reaffirmed to me by an elk hunter one December morning in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.This hunter had killed an elk on the National Elk Refuge, which is legal by special permit (though, given the name of the place, paradoxical) and with stipulations, such as only limited-range weapons allowed on the South Unit of the refuge. “Limited range” means muzzle-loader or bow and arrow or other old-fashioned weapons, so as to demand more of the hunters and give an element of fair chase. When I spotted this fellow from a nearby road, his dead elk lay on a one-wheeled game cart and with two friends he was rolling it slowly across the bottomland toward his truck. I went striding out to talk with him—committing exactly the sort of nosy intrusion that hunters with freshly killed animals seldom welcome. Once I had introduced myself and explained the basis of my nosiness, he answered my questions genially. His name was Mitch Bock, he said, “like the beer, not the composer.” He lived in Fort Collins, Colorado. He had gotten his elk—a nice cow, six or eight years old, just the sort that the refuge managers hoped to see taken—with a black-powder rifle. He had killed a cow yesterday too, under another permit. That hunt had required a four-hour belly crawl through the soggy meadowland to get near her.I thanked him for the information and was about to leave. But wait, he said, you’re from National Geographic? Yes. And you all are doing a special issue on Greater Yellowstone? Yes.“Don’t forget the little boreal toad,” he said. It’s native to Yellowstone, he explained, but like so many amphibians, isn’t doing well in the modern age.Everything is connected. That’s the first lesson not just of ecology but also of resource politics. The wolf is connected to the grizzly bear by way of their competition for ungulate prey, especially elk calves and adult elk that have been weakened by winter or the rigors of the autumn rut. Whitebark pine are connected to mountain pine beetles, whose population outbreaks are connected to climate change. Bison are connected to Montana livestock policy by way of a disease, brucellosis, probably brought to America in cattle. Elk are connected to the boreal toad by way of Mitch Bock.Elk are also connected to cutthroat trout. In this case it’s by way of grizzly predation, taking a bigger toll on elk—some evidence suggests—since the crash of the Yellowstone Lake cutthroat. Aspen trees and willows are connected to wolves and grizzlies by way of the heavier elk predation, which does seem to have helped aspen and willow stands recover (notwithstanding Arthur Middleton’s scorn for the simplistic version of this story) from decades of heavy browsing. Then again, decades of drought and the absence of beaver, whose “habitat engineering” raises the water table, may also have contributed to the historic aspen and willow suppression. Trumpeter swans, rare in Yellowstone, are connected to cutthroat trout by way of bald eagles, which now fly from Yellowstone Lake (where cutthroat, their favored prey, have so declined) to nearby Riddle Lake, where they feed not just on trout but also on the cygnets of nesting swans. Moose are connected to beaver because moose eat willows, but they’re connected also to mule deer by way of a parasitic nematode worm (Elaeophora schneideri), for which mule deer are the usual host. Horseflies carry the worm from deer to deer—or from deer to moose, brokering that connection. The worm is innocuous in mule deer, but in moose it can restrict blood flow to the head, sometimes causing brain damage, blindness, and death. Grizzly bears are connected to corn farmers in Kansas and their decisions on pesticide use by way of army cutworm moths.The changes that ricochet through these networks of connection, from animal to plant, predator to prey, one level of the food web to another, are known to ecologists as trophic cascades. They are a focus of interest, and disagreement, among scientists who study the wildlife and vegetation of Yellowstone, including Doug Smith and Arthur Middleton. The details of those disagreements become almost Talmudic in complexity, but what’s important to keep in mind is that disturbances have secondary effects, usually unforeseen, and that sometimes those effects are irreversible. Restoring wolves to Yellowstone, for example, does not necessarily fix all the problems that removing wolves from Yellowstone caused.Such interconnections underscore the truth of a truism: that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is an intricate, interactive compoundment of living creatures, relationships, physical factors, geological circumstances, historical accidents, and biological processes. As an ecosystem, in all its glories and its troubles, its fractured relationships and the consequences of those fractures, it can teach us a lot about how nature works. Its greatest value, its fullest purpose, is not simply to freeze a picturesque place “in the condition that prevailed when the area was first visited by the white man,” as the Leopold Report proposed. Why measure time from the arrival of white men? Ecosystems are continually subject to change, both from human-delivered disturbances (including those caused by indigenous peoples) and from natural ones. The long outline of the Yellowstone Caldera, nicely visible from the top of Mount Washburn, should be enough to remind us of that. In its aboriginal condition 640,000 years ago, the whole place was just a vast smoking hole.Instead of a smoking hole, we wanted a landscape full of living creatures as well as geysers and canyons, and by a long series of visionary acts, heroic efforts, mistakes, corrections, happy accidents, and good decisions, we have it in 2016. Superintendent Dan Wenk told me that he thinks Yellowstone National Park, for all its problems, might be in better overall shape now than at any time since 1975, the year the grizzly bear’s decline was recognized with federal protection. Hallac, notwithstanding his concern with the creeping crisis, agreed.Whether the same can be said of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem—that it’s in better shape now than for many decades past—is more questionable. Have we vastly improved this great area since the bad old days of commercial poaching and vandalism, governmental neglect, Wild West brigandage, and railroad dreams—or have we already gone a long way toward making it a big, boring suburb with antler-motif doorknobs?The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a focus of many angers, in part because it contains so many different expectations governed by different interests. Some hunters are angry that there aren’t enough elk. Some ranchers are angry that there are too many. Some wolf lovers are angry that wolves, including those that spend much of their year within Yellowstone Park, now may be hunted or trapped when they roam beyond the park boundaries. Some landowners in Gardiner, Montana, are angry that bison migrate out of the park in winter and into their yards. Some stockmen are angry that migrating bison carry brucellosis, which might be passed to their cows, although not a single case of bison-to-cow transmission has been documented. Some wildlife activists, including those of the Buffalo Field Campaign, are angry that bison from the park, once they migrate out, may be corralled and shipped to slaughter. Some range scientists are angry about overgrazed grasslands in the two parks, resulting from too many bison and elk. Some fishermen are angry about the slaughter of lake trout. Somebody somewhere is probably angry about coyotes. Scarcely a season passes, in the gateway towns of Cody and Jackson and Bozeman, without several public meetings, called by the various agencies, at which people express these angers.One such meeting occurred this past December in a hotel conference room at Jackson’s ski resort. Roughly a hundred people crowded in, interested citizens filling rows of chairs, some standing at the back, to hear scientists and managers deliver updates to an interagency committee charged with overseeing the Yellowstone grizzly bear. The atmosphere was tense and adversarial. Many people in the room had fought one another over this issue for decades. The crowd heard Chris Servheen, coordinator of grizzly recovery under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (a position he has held for 35 years), explain that the Yellowstone population had reached its benchmarks—“We consider the bear recovered”—and that his agency soon would propose removing it from the “threatened” list under the Endangered Species Act.How soon? Very, but indefinite. Delisting means that the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho would be free to issue licenses to hunt grizzlies for the first time since 1975. Frank van Manen, head of an interagency science team that studies the bear, made a dispassionate presentation, which included encouraging data on current grizzly numbers and their distribution throughout the ecosystem, and Servheen discussed those data, all to a largely skeptical crowd. Other scientists and managers took their turns, answering polite questions from the committee, edgier ones from the audience. Toward the end of the afternoon, the floor was opened for public comment from any people who had entered their names on a list.A man named Reuben Fast Horse, representing the Oglala Sioux Tribe, walked to the podium carrying a small drum. His longish dark hair was pushed back behind his ears. He adjusted the microphone, took off his glasses, and began speaking in Lakota, one of the Sioux dialects. All the white people listened raptly. Occasionally we caught a word—“Europeans.” Fast Horse spoke for three minutes, his speech musical but utterly incomprehensible to most of us, then came to an end point and said: “Don’t worry, the rest will be in English.”He read a statement from the president of the tribe, expressing strong opposition by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council to delisting the grizzly. This statement noted a relationship with the bear “that has existed from time immemorial,” and stressed that the tribe “recognizes the grizzly as a relative, a healer and a teacher of our people, as exemplified in narratives related to our ancestors.” Fast Horse added some words of his own, explaining that his Lakota people “never ate or hunted bear” anymore because, when they originally had, “the skeletal remains looked too human, too close to ourselves.” Then he lifted his drum and his stick, played a strong cadence, and sang a bear song in Lakota.Imagine you’re a federal manager, like Wenk, seated at the committee table. How do you reconcile that with the metrics of population biology?Wenk himself has concerns about grizzly delisting—not that the bear population hasn’t robustly recovered, but that the negotiating process doesn’t directly include the National Park Service. That process is “owned by the Fish and Wildlife Service,” he told me later, with park voices left “peripheral.” Will the new management regime weigh the interests of Yellowstone and Grand Teton visitors, who want to see bears, equally with the interests of hunters? Will the sheer economics of bear-watching be duly considered? What happens if a grizzly is wounded in Montana, then comes roaring back across the boundary to suffer its agonies in Yellowstone? What about visitor safety? What about perceptions? Who puts the animal out of its miseries? Who takes the heat? Does that bear count in the hunting limits?I asked Wenk whether he had gotten satisfactory answers to these questions. He’s a patient man, and a professional. He said: “Not yet.”Wenk’s concern reflects an important truth: that the people who live and work and hunt and fish and hike within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem—even people such as Reuben Fast Horse, whose local ancestry goes back millennia—are not the sole possessors of legitimate interest. This is America’s place, and the world’s. Animal lovers at the far reaches of Twitter, people who have never given ten minutes’ thought to grizzly bear conservation, who could never tell you the Lakota word for grizzly nor the bear’s key foods in Yellowstone, are angry at Wenk for ordering the death of the sow that killed Lance Crosby in the summer of 2015. Yellowstone National Park received more than four million visitors that year; Grand Teton National Park received over three million; and having set foot in these places, such visitors feel invested—which is good. As the superintendent of Grand Teton, David Vela, said last July to a group of Latino schoolkids from Jackson who were spending a week in that park as part of an outreach program: “You own this national park. This is part of your heritage as Americans.”Wes Livingston, the mountain guide, the inveterate hunter and antler collector, the detester of government regulation, the despiser of fatuous liberals and whiny cattlemen, captured much the same spirit one evening in camp up in the Thorofare. Livingston views the park as a single big ranch, managed for desirable animals. In other words: the cultivated wild.“Who owns this ranch?” I asked. “We do,” he said. “Who is ‘we’?” “The United States of America. The citizens of America, the taxpayers.” “Does an outfitter in Cody own it more than a wolf hugger in New Jersey?” “Absolutely not,” Livingston said.If the wolves provoke varied angers, and the ownership matter is more consensual, other issues stir quiet worries. Agency biologists such as Mark Bruscino worry that the loss of big private ranches to subdivisions will destroy migration routes and winter ranges of public wildlife. Some grizzly bear advocates worry that, with declines in certain major bear foods, delisting and the hunting to follow will doom the Yellowstone grizzly. Others worry that failure to delist the bear, despite its robust recovery, will only further inflame resentment against the grizzly among people with whom it shares habitat and will undermine the Endangered Species Act itself. Bird lovers worry that the trumpeter swan may be eradicated from Yellowstone. Some herpetologists, along with Mitch Bock, worry that an exotic fungus or climate change, or both, may kill off the boreal toad. Wildlife veterinarians worry about the approach of chronic wasting disease, a bizarre affliction similar to mad cow disease, spreading northward toward Greater Yellowstone among mule deer. Tourists worry that, amid the summer crowding, they won’t get a room at Lake Hotel or the Old Faithful Inn. Rangers worry that still another clueless tourist will be gored while taking a selfie in front of a bison. Hallac worries about the crisis creeping across Yellowstone and whether it will slowly ruin the park.As if that weren’t enough, some people worry (despite reassurances from experts such as Robert Smith) that the Yellowstone supervolcano will explode again soon, incinerating everything and everyone within 200 miles.And me? My concerns focus on the grizzly bear, because I consider this the highest and best purpose of Yellowstone Park and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem: to preserve a viable population of that great, terrible animal at the center of the American West into the indefinite future. But I no longer share the extreme pessimism of bear-advocate friends of mine, like Doug Peacock and Dave Mattson, nor their distrust of Kerry Gunther, Mark Bruscino, Chris Servheen, and the other conscientious agency biologists I’ve met, who believe that the bear’s intelligence and flexibility of behavior will keep it robust and numerous despite changes in the landscape that require greater reliance on some different foods.After all, they say, the grizzly is an omnivore, and three major dietary items—the trout, the pine nuts, the moths—have never been available to all of Yellowstone’s bears every year, nor even to many bears during some years. Whitebark pine nuts come and go in cycles. Spawning cutthroat offered nothing to bears on the west side of Yellowstone, distant from the lake. Likewise with army cutworm moths: Many grizzlies exploit them, but not all grizzlies.Change may come, these scientists say, but the bear will adapt to the challenge. Dan Wenk is right, though, that the devil could be in the details—that the opaque process of delisting and the return of responsibility to the states contain potential harm to the grizzlies, and to the public’s interest in them, against which there must be guarantees.Meanwhile we the owners of Yellowstone National Park, and of Grand Teton, and of the national forests and other federal lands of the ecosystem, face some new challenges of our own. The parks need more funding for the impossible work they do; only a fraction of their operating and improvement funds comes from Congress, whereas crucial initiatives such as the Yellowstone Wolf Project are supported by private money, through “friends” organizations such as the Yellowstone Park Foundation. The parks need political support for hard decisions, such as the one that may come when, because of overcrowding, private automobiles are no longer allowed to enter. Sorry: Get on the shuttle.The most heated wildlife issues, notably grizzly and bison and wolf, need collaborative solutions, not continuing warfare. Passionately dedicated people need to recognize that righteous intransigence is not a strategy; it’s just a satisfying attitude. The various agency members of the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee need to add private groups as partners and to make bold decisions that transcend turf politics. Climate change seems to be hurting Yellowstone—by way of temperature ranges, insect cycles, drought, who knows what else—and we all need to do better on fixing that.Ha, easier said than done. But if the Yellowstone grizzly bear is expected to adapt, modify its behavior, and cope with new realities, shouldn’t we be expected to do that too?Any backcountry trip in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a rare privilege, and mine to the Thorofare with Arthur Middleton and Wes Livingston had moments of pure savor beyond the science. With his elk calves counted, Arthur and I rode still higher on the Thorofare Plateau, above our camp, above the summering elk, until the rising swell of land crested as a narrow ridge at about 10,300 feet. I was amazed that backcountry horses could climb so high and keep their balance on such footing, but I tried not to think about that. Gnarled whitebark pine, much of it dead but some alive, formed a thin windbreak along the ridge. We crossed rocky ground, and meadows enlivened by Indian paintbrush, and then patches of mud, just melted out from beneath last winter’s snow, where in a week or two fresh alpine grasses might grow. The vista around us, through 360 degrees, was epic.I turned in my saddle, trying to see it all: the Absaroka Range to the northeast, the Trident Plateau just across Thorofare Creek, Yellowstone Lake in the distance beyond that, and even farther, the Gallatin Range. I cranked around. Westward was Two Ocean Plateau, then the Grand Tetons to our southwest, with the Grand itself rising to 13,775 feet, unmistakable in height and profile above the Snake River and Grand Teton National Park. Coming toward us from the south: the highest reaches of the upper Yellowstone River. Arthur pointed across the Castle Creek cirque to where, along a north-facing rim, sizable cornices and couloirs of snow still lingered, shedding their melt to the streams below. This was late July. Look at all that water, he said. It drains to the big river. It grows the grass to feed the elk.To feed the whole thing, I thought: all the processes, all the players. The photosynthesis and the herbivory and the predation and the competition and the migration and the parasitism and the decomposition, everything downstream, everything that moves into Yellowstone and across it and back out. Seems almost like this is where the ecosystem begins, I said.“If an ecosystem ‘begins’ anywhere,” Arthur agreed, “this would be it.”For every beginning in the natural world, there is an ending, and then a beginning again. Does that robust cyclicity hold true even when nature’s wildness is cultivated by people? Maybe. If the cultivation is judicious, humble, and wise. We’re up so high here, atop the Thorofare Plateau, you and I and Arthur Middleton, that a person can almost see the future.In a spectacular yearlong event, the National Geographic Channel series America’s National Parks will show you the parks’ natural wonders—both big and small—as you have never experienced them before. Learn more about the series.",
"Orca (left), Dazzle (center), and Rooster—"bear dogs" with the Nevada Department of Wildlife—drive away a black bear  in Nevada's Lake Tahoe Basin.When dozens of polar bears descended upon the northern Russian archipelago of Novaya Zemlya, no one was sure what to do. The bears entered homes and public buildings, and people were afraid to go outside. But polar bears are an endangered species in Russia, and the federal government has refused to issue licenses to shoot them.This “invasion,” as it’s been called, has sparked conversations about how prepared wildlife managers in North America are for an influx of polar bears as they lose critical habitat from melting sea ice and take to land in search of food. Similarly, black bears’ ranges are expanding and oil and gas development is increasingly close to or in bear territory. (Learn more: Two rare bear attacks show a rise in conflicts with people.)Typically if a bear shows up at a dump or digging through someone’s garbage, “you’d either show up, corner the animal, and euthanize it,” says Alan Myers from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, "or you would dart the animal, put it in a cage, and take it many miles away. Those were the only two options and neither one of those was effective at all.”One bear biologist, Carrie Hunt, has made it her life’s mission to find effective, non-lethal methods to prevent human-bear conflict. After watching how wildlife rangers’ dogs could scare bears away, she was inspired. In 1996, Hunt founded the Wind River Bear Institute, headquartered in Florence, Montana, to train a special breed of dogs to be “bear shepherds”—to bark and scare away bears when they get too close to human settlements and to condition them to steer clear.Karelian bear dogs (pictured, Orca in Nevada) were originally bred in Europe to hunt big game.Since then, law enforcement and wildlife agencies in the United States and Canada increasingly have begun turning to dogs as an alternative to keep bears away. Bear dogs now work with wildlife and land managers in the states of Washington and Nevada, as well as Alberta, Canada, and even in Japan. Several national parks, including Banff, Yosemite, and Glacier, have contracted bear dogs too.“Bears are naturally afraid of canids,” Hunt says. “Why? Because packs of coyotes can steal cubs.”The most common breed of bear dog is the Karelian bear dog, a black-and-white working dog that hails from the region between Finland and Russia called Karelia. Finnish breeders originally intended the animal to be a big game hunting dog, but Hunt realized they could be trained to manage wildlife, too. The Wind River Bear Institute breeds, trains, and sells Karelian bear dogs as well as contracts them out to agencies that don’t have the resources to have their own program.“I am confident saying that thousands of bears have been spared the bullet using this nonlethal technique,” said Rich Beausoleil, a wildlife biologist with Washington’s wildlife department, which has eight dogs, in an email.Bear dogs are especially helpful when a bear gets habituated to a particular spot, such as a garbage dump. The wildlife officer will trap the bear at the site, and then bring in the dogs.“They’ll bark at this animal and scare the heck out of it [to] let them know it’s not where it’s supposed to be and it should never come back to this location,” Myers says. After the dogs have barked at the bear for a while, they open up the bear’s cage.“The bear boogies out. It takes off like a rocket,” Myers says. Sometimes they fire beanbag rounds or rubber bullets to scare the bear even more, and then the bear dogs are released.“They want to go out and get that bear,” says Nils Pedersen, the wildlife dog program coordinator at Wind River Bear Institute’s satellite kennel in Fairbanks, Alaska. They track it, bark at it, nip at its heels, until the dogs are called back by their handlers. By then, the bear has hopefully learned its lesson that that’s not a place it wants to return to.“The good thing about bears is that they’re smart enough to know [and] to learn quickly. Studies have found there is a very good non-return rate,” according to Myers.In the 20 years he’s been working with bear dogs, Beausoleil says he hasn’t seen any dogs injured because of their work. Hunt emphasizes that safety is her chief concern when sending dogs after bears, and she says they’ve had no injuries in the field either.Pedersen has formed a very close bond with his principal Karelian bear dog, Soledad.“Over the years, Soledad and I have grown together in ways that can only be described as true partnership,” Pedersen says. “I think that our personalities were complimentary to begin with...but the joy that this dog brings me cannot be adequately put into words. Soledad is a huntress.”Together they’ve released 500-pound black bears in Tahoe and pushed mama grizzlies with cubs out of campgrounds in the Rocky Mountains. But Soledad is also trained to do something else—she can sniff out polar bear dens. (Also read about dogs that can sniff out cancer.)Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, land managers at oil and gas fields and other work sites are required to establish mile-wide buffer zones around polar bear dens, preventing activity until their hibernation is over.Dazzle pursues a black bear in Lake Tahoe. Bears learn to fear dogs and people during such incidents, which makes them less likely to become problem animals.It’s an increasingly important role as polar bears move closer to human activity because of melting sea ice. Soledad can smell polar bears under feet of snow and alert Pedersen when she’s found a den, thus allowing the den and its inhabitants to finish their long sleep undisturbed.Bear dogs have also been helpful in solving wildlife crimes. Beausoleil, who handles dogs Indy and Cash, says while their main duties relate to bears and cougars, they’ve also been tasked with helping investigate poaching.When the wildlife department was tipped off that a gray wolf had been poached—the first in recent memory—it was critical to find the body.“Officers searched hundreds of hours looking for it, and someone said, ‘You know what, geez, I wonder if the Karelian bear dog guys could find this?’” Beausoleil says.The dogs were able to track down the carcass in 40 minutes. With the body, law enforcement was able to prove the crime and prosecute the case.In another case, officers were tipped off that an elk had been poached, and they went to the suspect’s house to investigate, finding an elk head.Grizzly bears can be eight feet long and weigh more than a thousand pounds.But they needed more evidence to bring the suspect to court. The investigators went out to search for the rest of the elk’s body, but they came up empty-handed. But within 20 minutes of bringing in the bear dog team, one of the dogs found elk remains. DNA from the head matched DNA from the remains. (Read about sniffer dogs that find cremated human remains in the rubble after wildfires.)“They were able to prosecute once again based on being able to find the carcass, which we never would’ve found without the bear dog,” Beausoleil says.Despite the enthusiasm for the program among some state wildlife managers, Karelian bear dogs aren’t the best choice for everyone or every setting.Ann Bryant, executive director of The BEAR League, a volunteer bear conservation group in Tahoe, ran into obstacles trying to use them in populated areas. Fourteen years ago, the organization got two Karelian bear dogs, Anya and Dmytry, from a breeder and trained them up.“Anya and Dmytry were a huge hit at our public lectures and outreaches and were able to help us talk some bears out from under homes,” Bryant said in an email, but “it quickly became evident that allowing them to chase bears through neighborhoods and across busy roadways and through shopping center parking lots was not a good idea.”Furthermore, training bear dogs is a lot of work, and not everyone’s up to the challenge.“It’s a huge, full-time job because that dog is there with you all the time,” Bryant says. “It can work, it’s not a panacea….You really got to research it, be dedicated at it. These dogs have to become your life.” (See the rigors of war dog training.)Derek Reich, a volunteer who assists the Nevada Department of Wildlife with its bear dog team, says that the time and resources required to train bear dogs has limited the growth of their program.“It's also easier for a lot of agencies to just kill the bear,” Reich said in an email. “In most states, black bears are a game species. It's a lot of effort and resources put into an animal who may just be harvested in a hunt the next week.”After more than twenty years at the helm of the institute, Hunt says she’ll be stepping back soon from the program, and Pedersen will be taking over as executive director.“I’m going to just work on breeding and raising the dogs and matching them and placing them in agencies (where) I know them,” she said. “I’m going to try to expand the use of these dogs into new areas that have bear problems like the east coast of the United States.”Hunt says she’s proud of her legacy. “I had this dream, and it became a reality because I never gave up,” she says. “It was in my DNA to want to communicate with dogs and bears and work to help them.”",
"Piper, a border collie from the Institute for Canine Forensics, signals to her handler that she has found human cremains on the site of a house burned to the ground during the Carr Fire in California.Nobody should have to lose a loved one twice. Some dogs are helping to prevent that from happening.When wildfires like the ones that ravaged California this summer sweep into a neighborhood, there is no time to collect valuables. Homeowners flee with bare essentials. Among the precious things that must be left include cremated remains, or cremains, often stored in a receptacle kept on a shelf or mantle. But now, professionally trained detection dogs are being dispatched to recover these human ashes from the charred ruins of destroyed homes.“These people are devastated,” says Lynne Engelbert of the Institute for Canine Forensics, which uses Historical Human Remains Detection dogs to locate cremains. (See photos of detection dogs being trained to find human remains.)Human cremains have a distinct odor that trained dogs can easily identify, even in a house that has been totally destroyed by a wildfire that likely topped 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.These dogs are “not fixed on a person’s scent—they’re fixed on human cremains,” says Engelbert.The Carr Fire in California, which burned for 39 days over late July into early September, destroyed over 1,000 homes and burned almost 230,000 acres. Seven homeowners contacted the non-profit Institute for Canine Forensics for help finding cremains, a service provided free of charge. Save for one instance—when the site was compromised by people walking through it—the detection dogs found cremains in ashes that can be 8 inches deep, sometimes in a matter of minutes.“When we walk onto a site, there’s a lot of stress,” says Engelbert, a trained firefighter who has been doing search and rescue with detection dogs for 30 years, including in New York City after 9/11. “When we walk off of a site, there’s hugs, and tears, and lots of good feelings”“It’s why I do what I do,” she says.Piper, Jasper, and Jett—all who were on site at the Carr Fire recently—work with the Institute for Canine Forensics to recover human cremains, including those of Native American ancestors lost to time. In 2017 Piper and Engelbert were flown to Nikumaroro Island, in Kiribati, to look for traces of Amelia Earhart as part of an Institute for Canine Forensics search team sponsored by National Geographic and The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery.The four dogs on that trip all detected traces of human remains beneath a tree on the island where items were found: a jackknife, a woman’s compact, a zipper pull, and glass jars. But no human bones were found on the island that could have positively identified either Earhart or her navigator, Fred Noonan.The ability to sniff out such subtle odors is possible because of dogs’ remarkable noses. The animals can smell at least one part per trillion, which is at least three times more sensitive than the most sensitive mechanical sniffers. And compared to human schnozes, dogs’ smelling abilities are up to 100,000 times better, by some measures.According to a 2016 study in Frontiers in Veterinary Science, canines can detect the equivalent of “one drop of a liquid in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools.”Dogs have hundreds of millions of olfactory receptors—compared to just a few million in humans—and their nostrils register scents independently from each other, giving them the ability to smell in stereo. Their super-smelling abilities allow them to identify bombs, drugs, missing people, and to detect medical conditions like cancer.When humans reward dogs for smelling specific scents, the animals learn to hone in on those odors, and ignore all others. That’s how detection dogs are made.Piper the border collie smells the ground while looking for human bones hidden in the woods during a training exercise with the Institute for Canine Forensics in Saratoga, Calif.,According to Sue Stejskal, special deputy and forensic canine handler at St. Joseph County Sheriff Department in Michigan, any dog can learn this skill but certain breeds partner better with people, and have the drive and focus to be successful.As for training a dog to recognize a certain odor, it’s the same as any other sort of training, she says: “Find out what the dog loves and give them what they love for finding it.”For example, Stejskal trained her Canadian-born spaniel, Maple, to detect bed bugs. She lined up paint cans with holes in them and put different things inside. Into one went bed bugs. When Maple dipped her nose down and sniffed the correct paint can, she got a reward. As time went by, Stejskal decreased the number of bed bugs in the paint can. Then she introduced other distractions—dead bedbugs, toys, food—continuing to reward Maple when she got it right.Separately, Stejskal trained Maple to sit as a signal that she found the bed bug odor. The next step was to link the two behaviors: find scent, sit, get reward. Then, in possibly the trickiest part, Stejskal changed it up so that Maple learned to work in all sorts of environments.When working the Carr Fire sites for human cremains, Engelbert put Piper, a black-and-white border collie, through her paces just as she did during the search for Earhart’s remains. Piper is one of eight detection dogs Englebert knows of that can specialize in human cremains. Institute handlers are training three more dogs to do that work.Engelbert’s signal to Piper that it’s time to get going is simple: She says, “Do you want to go to work?” Piper nearly always is.Once at the site of the burned home, the owners will show the team where the cremains were kept, whether in the kitchen or on the mantlepiece. A small keepsake urn holds about three tablespoons of cremains, Engelbert says, and that’s the smallest amount she’s seen her dogs detect.When Piper finds cremains, which can take as little as two minutes, she lays down near or on top of them, Engelbert says.Next, volunteer archaeologists start clearing an area, isolating what the dogs signaled they found, brushing off layers of ash until cremains emerge. They are “unmistakable—kind of grainy, sometimes with small chunks of bones in them,” Engelbert says.After a successful find, handlers reward the dogs. In Engelbert’s case, the prize takes the form of a rolled-up towel and a game of tug-of-war.They can also receive positive reinforcement from homeowners whose loved ones’ cremains have been recovered.The dogs “get all sorts of love… and it’s therapeutic just because they’re there,” Engelbert says. “They do therapy in addition to the recovery.”",
"Another season of dry weather and high winds, another series of devastating fires. An expansive blaze in Northern California has now burned nearly 90,000 acres, according to local reports, and has destroyed more than 500 structures, leaving hundreds of people around Redding, California, hurrying to protect their homes, business, and communities.We spoke with National Geographic photographer Mark Thiessen, a certified wildland firefighter, about how fires spread and how they can be stopped. His footage and images show wildfire damage up close, and how often the smartest thing people can do is to get out of the way.A fire acts like a living organism. The same way a plant spreads its seeds, a fire creates wind to spread its embers. A fire causes hot air and smoke to rise rapidly, pulling in air along the ground to replace it. This creates a wind that will push the fire along which creates a self-perpetuating cycle of fire that is impossible to stop. This wind helps the fire race through forests and neighborhoods, launching embers at everything that could burn. To make everything worse, as the air temperature increases, the relative humidity drops, which dries out the vegetation and makes it catch fire more easily.This picture shows a house in the Smiley Park area of Running Springs, California, in the very early stages of burning down. An ember, likely blown from a nearby burning house, landed on dry pine needles on a wood deck.The same view, the next day.An ember the size of a pencil eraser can be blown onto a wood window sill and can begin to burn the house down. It’s not a large tsunami wave of fire that burns down houses, it’s more likely it’s a blizzard of embers from a nearby burning house that get lodged into a flammable exterior of the new house and will start burning it down.The most dangerous position to be in is trying to evacuate at the last minute. On February 7, 2009, 180 people died in Victoria, Australia, in a single day when 400 fires ravaged the area on Melbourne’s hottest day ever. Many died in last-minute evacuations when strong winds blew black smoke across roads making it impossible to see. These conditions turn day into night while reducing visibility that caused car accidents. It’s best to heed evacuation warnings and get out while you still can.Houses are like flypaper for embers. Strong, dry winds blow embers from already burning homes onto adjacent homes where they stick and ignite. In these-wind driven fires, the embers can blow through the green vegetation and land on structures that are like standing firewood, like a house. Once the fire gets established the home will eventually burn down.In my before and after photos, you can see embers have landed on some pine needles on the wood deck. Hot, dry winds ignited the pine needles. This is a house in the very early stages of burning down. Everyone has been evacuated, there is no one around to put this small fire out. This house was already a goner.Mother Nature causes fires and Mother Nature puts them out. These fires are pushed by the perfect combination of wind, temperature, and low humidity. Until the weather changes, the best firefighters can do is herd the fire around and do their best to protect lives and property. Only when the wind stops, the temperature drops, and the humidity rises do the fires start to put themselves out.",
"A large fire tearing through Holy Jim Canyon in California that has charred more than 6,200 acres so far has a familiar origin. Though not always intentional or criminal, humans are the most common cause of wildfires in the United States.   Earlier this week, a man named Forrest Clark was arrested in connection to the Holy Fire, the name given to a group of several different wildfires that have blazed through forests in southern California. It's the second such arrest this summer.Last month, a man from Temecula, California, was arrested for starting what eventually grew into the large Cranston Fire.“The probability of fires is increasing because people are increasing,” Jon Keeley from the U.S. Geological Survey told National Geographic in 2014.   His predictions have proven true year over year as fires have grown deadlier, larger, and more numerous. Last year, one of the largest wildfires tearing through southern California was caused by a downed power line. Illegal campfires can start blazes, like one that began in 2009 and grew to destroy more than 2,700 acres. Everything from items with small sparks like cigarette butts to more ostentatious flames like fireworks have started large fires.   A study published in 2017 in the journal PNAS found that, at the national level, debris burning is responsible for 29 percent of wildfires and arson causes 21 percent of fires. Campfires accounted for just five percent, the study found.  Hot, windy, and dry conditions fueled by California's reoccurring droughts have created a tinder box that people can easily set ablaze. Recognizing the growing danger, the California Fire Department, U.S. Forest Service, and National Park Service created an educational campaign in 2014 called “One Less Spark.” The program outlines ways people can prevent wildfires by correctly burning trash, maintaining campgrounds, towing their cars safely, and properly using outdoor equipment.   While most commonly the culprit, people aren't always to blame for large fires. Wildfires are sometimes caused by lightning strikes or other natural conditions, but the California Fire Department estimates that those factors account for only about 5 percent of the fires started in the state.   In addition to the Holy Fire and Cranston Fire, California is also experiencing the largest fire in the state's history—the Mendocino Complex Fire. Though not the deadliest or most destructive ever seen, it's covering the most ground, having already scorched more than 283,800 acres as of this week. A cause for the Mendocino fire has not yet been disclosed.   As the Holy Fire continues to grow, Clark remains in jail under a $1 million bond. He could face life in state prison if found guilty.",
"If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.That was the angle many news outlets took this week with a viral video of a brown bear mother and cub. Shot by Dmitry Kedrov this summer with a drone on the coast of Russia’s Sea of Okhotsk, the video shows a baby bear repeatedly climbing up and falling down a treacherous, snowy slope.And though the video has a happy ending—the cub makes it to the top, and the duo walk off into the wilderness—numerous scientists have expressed concerns on social media about the way the video was shot.For instance, at just over one minute into the video, the camera zooms extremely close to the bears. At the same time, the mother appears to look directly at the remote-controlled helicopter, and even appears to swat at the device—which then seems to cause the cub to fall back down the slope.Kedrov told a Russian website that the zoom effect was done in post-production and that his drone did not scare the animals in any way. But some experts aren’t so sure.“It could be a zoom on the video camera, but most consumer drones don't have the payload capacity to carry a camera with a high quality zoom lens,” says Mark Ditmer, a wildlife ecologist at Boise State University who has studied the physiological impact drones have on black bears. “I could be wrong, but I would have to guess this is the drone approaching rapidly and the mother panicking and swatting out of fear.”“You look at the mother bear in that video and she’s staring straight at the drone for chunks of time,” Sophie Gilbert, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Idaho. “From her perspective it’s literally a UFO. It’s an unidentified flying object.”“She has no idea what it’s doing. She’s probably never seen anything like it in her life. She’s got a very young cub with her, and of course her response is going to be fear,” Gilbert says.In fact, the presence of the drone—and the desire to flee from it—could explain why the mother and her cub are traversing such treacherous terrain to begin with; Mothers with such young offspring usually avoid difficult travels unless necessary.While the details of this particular incident are still coming out, there are many other videos online that show the effects drones can have on wildlife.Gilbert points to videos of drones hovering above brown bears eating salmon, of a wolf attacking a moose, and of pronghorn antelope apparently trying to escape a low-flying drone as examples of where the machines are actually influencing the behavior of the animals.“I don’t know how much time you’ve spent around drones being flown, but they’re really loud,” says Gilbert, who conducted a review of how drones are being used in research in 2016. While some of these videos have soundtracks, many of them peaceful, “that is not how it sounds in real life.”Noise alone can take a toll on wild animals. It distracts them from other necessary functions, like eating or competing for mates. In some animals, these machines may trigger a fight or flight response, while others show increased vigilance like they would in the presence of a predator. And some animals appear not to be affected at all.(Related: “Oil and Gas Drilling Is Causing Birds to Have Fewer Chicks”)Looks can be deceiving, however. In Ditmer’s study from 2015, he was able to show that while most black bears didn’t run away or react in obvious ways to drones flying overheard, their heartrates were going through the roof.“Large spikes in heart rate indicate a stress response,” he explains. “In the most extreme example we saw bear's heart rate increase from 41 beats per minute prior to the drone flight to 162 beats per minute when the drone was overhead.”(Related: “Narwhals Wearing Heart Monitors Reveal Danger of Human Encounters”)And while it’s true that bears and other creatures can handle a quick heartbeat now and again, Ditmer notes that wild animals are already under a lot of stress trying to find enough food and avoid predators.What’s more, humans are adding to this stress load all the time as we continue to encroach into wild areas, piling on still more noise with cars, airplanes, ships, and oil and gas extraction.One thing that was clear after speaking with several experts is that nobody is saying we should ban all drones.“After reading some of the comments on the bear video, I am concerned that people demonize drones,” says Margarita Mulero-Pázmany, a lecturer in unmanned aerial vehicles at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom. “That would be a mistake. We should not blame the tool just because it can be misused.”Instead, we should develop best practices for scientists, hobbyists, and outdoors-enthusiasts alike that protect both animals and people.In a review she conducted in 2016, Mulero-Pázmany suggests that drone operators avoid flying at animals head-on, as this is thought to be most threatening. Similarly, all flights should be as short and discrete as possible, while using models are smaller and electric which are much quieter than larger, gas-powered drones. Altitude is also key, and operators should strive to stay as high above the scene as possible while still gathering useful data.Finally, care should be taken to avoid endangered species, animals that may be more vulnerable to drone presence like those that fly or who have evolved to fear aerial predators, and to never interfere with animals during sensitive times in their life cycle, such as breeding seasons.“I think it’s a double-edged sword,” says Gilbert. On the one hand, when drones are operated correctly, there’s a chance to help people feel more connected with wildlife, which she says is extremely important for conservation outcomes.But people also need to remember that animals have their own lives, needs, and fears to attend to, and we “need to not interfere,” Gilbert says.",
"Our helmeted hornbills magazine story almost didn’t have any photos of helmeted hornbills in it.OK, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but it’s true that we were close to not having enough photos of the bird to fill out the magazine story. When Tim Laman, the photographer, first pitched a story about these ancient-looking birds, he knew it would be a challenging assignment. The birds are extremely rare, shy, and elusive.“I’ve been pursuing hornbills in the rain forests of Southeast Asia for many, many years,” Tim told me. “One of the reasons I wanted to pursue this story was because in my Geographic hornbills story 20 years ago, I photographed many other species, but I never got any good pictures of helmeted hornbills.” (See the 1999 story, "The Shrinking World of Hornbills," members only.)A male rhinoceros hornbill feeds on figs in the Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary in southern Thailand.A Palawan hornbill holds a fig in the Philippines' Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.This great hornbill was photographed in Thailand's Khao Yai National Park.A great hornbill pauses to preen in the rain forest canopy on its way to a fruiting fig tree in the Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary.It was important now more than ever to try, though. The helmeted hornbill is heading toward extinction because of the booming black market for carvings made from its “horn.” Other hornbills have hollow casques, as their horns are called, but the helmeted hornbill’s is solid and easy to carve into beads, figurines, and intricate scenes, which have suddenly become the thing for a certain subset of wealthy Chinese.It’s not too late to save the helmeted hornbill, we learned, but to get people to care, we had to be able to show them the bird in all its splendor.“I knew it was going to be hard,” Tim said. “Twenty years ago it was hard, and now they’ve been hunted so much more, they were even rarer. But it turned out to be even harder than I expected.”This red-knobbed hornbill, on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, visits a nest cavity to feed his chick. A strangler fig tree, which produces some of the bird’s favorite food, grows around the trunk of the nesting tree.Tim knew our best chance at finding helmeted hornbills would be during breeding season, roughly from March to August. That’s when the female seals herself inside a tree cavity to incubate her egg and raise the chick for up to 150 days, and during that period, the male must deliver them food multiple times a day. If we could spot an active nest, we at least had a chance to see a male.We were in touch with a research team in Thailand. They recruit former hornbill hunters to monitor and protect hornbill nests—they’re the experts who know which nests are active and how to get to them.It turns out we were treated to not one, but two, active nests—at the top of a mountain. Suffice it to say it was a very steep, very muddy, very sweaty slog, with a lot of equipment in tow. Tim and I did some quick math, and we figured that with about 15 porters, each carrying 40 to 50 pounds of gear, at least 600 pounds of stuff was hauled up the mountain—the camping equipment, a generator, provisions, and the overnight bags for all the team members. And, Tim says, that’s packing as light as possible, taking just the essentials for a National Geographic-level shoot: His RED digital cinema camera, several Canon SLRs, a set of lenses, a heavy-duty tripod, and a lighter tripod."I’d never been so thankful to be a writer, needing only a pen, paper, and my own eyes to observe my subject.Photographer Tim Laman built a blind high up in the canopy of Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary to stake out a fruiting fig tree, in hopes that a helmeted hornbill would come to feed.Once we got to the first nest site, Tim built blinds for us to hide behind, and we sat there for hours at a time, waiting for papa hornbill to bring a meal to his mate and chick. We often heard his maniacal laughter, seeming to mock us, just a few trees over. Maybe he was figuring out whether it was safe to approach. He lived up to his Latin name, Buceros vigil—vigilant, as in, no matter how well we hid, he always seemed to know we were there.Still, he did show himself a few times, but so briefly that getting National Geographic-worthy shots was a challenge.After several days of watching the nest, we got word that a fig tree was fruiting in nearby Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary. It was a chance for us to see helmeted hornbills in a different setting. When fig trees bear fruit, the whole forest menagerie comes to feast, so we had to get there fast to look for hungry helmeted hornbills before the tree was picked clean.A huge storm broke just as we arrived, but Tim nevertheless managed to build a blind a hundred feet up in a nearby tree. Thankfully he managed to not get struck by lightning. (Watch how Tim climbs a tree here.)The next morning, and for several mornings after that, we were out at the fig tree by a little after 5 a.m. We hoped that if we were in place before the sun came up, the helmeted hornbills wouldn’t know we were there.A great hornbill flies over Thailand’s Khao Yai National Park.Sitting in the early morning darkness, Tim high above and I on the ground, we heard the night insects quiet down and the screeching day insects start up. We waited as the mist of the night gave way to the humidity of the day. We saw monkeys and giant squirrels, rhinoceros hornbills and great hornbills. But, alas, no helmeted hornbills showed up for some figs.Ten-hour days in a tree don’t seem to phase Tim. He’s gotten pretty good at making himself comfortable. “I try to make a little seat,” he said. “I have a pad to sit on, and I can move around and stretch a little bit. The helmeted hornbills weren’t cooperative, but there were other birds and monkeys. There’s a lot to watch for, and I was photographing and filming a lot of the time.”After a few days at the fig tree, we had to move on. I went to Indonesia to continue my reporting, while Tim went back to the first site to visit the other nest. The male helmeted hornbill was less shy at this nest, and he was able to get a few more shots. There still wasn’t a lot of variety though.“The only images I had at that point were at the nest: The female was already inside, and the male was delivering food. It was great, but it was only part of the story,” Tim said.Back in the office the team began discussions about highlighting other species of hornbills. If we didn’t have enough photos of the helmeted hornbill...well then, that just showed how elusive and rare they really are, we reasoned. The hornbill family as a whole is fascinating and beautiful, so we figured we could highlight some of the other species to paint a more complete picture of Southeast Asia’s rain forest ecosystem. After all, we did see some gorgeous rhinoceros hornbills and great hornbills.We had a few more months before the story was to publish, and we were planning one more trip to Indonesian Borneo, a hot spot for helmeted hornbill poaching. We hoped we’d see a helmeted hornbill while we were out in the forest, but we knew this trip was more about documenting the hunting of the bird than actually seeing the bird itself. On this trip there was no time for Tim to hang out for hours on end in a blind. Our hopes weren’t high.Rhinoceros hornbills sit high in the canopy at Gunung Palung National Park, on the island of Borneo.After spending a week with a community of Dayak Iban, an indigenous group, we’d learned a lot about the significance of the bird in their culture and why some of their own were turning to poaching. Then on what was to be the very last day of the trip, we heard from a researcher that his team had spotted a pair of helmeted hornbills scoping out potential nest sites in western Borneo.It seemed too good to be true. This was the last chance to make photos of the helmeted hornbill for our story.I had to fly back to Washington, D.C., but the rest of the team quickly got provisions together and headed out to the site, filled with anticipation.“I was really excited to hear about that location,” Tim said. “It was a unique opportunity to see and photograph a male and female outside the nest. I was happy—and relieved—to get variety so that the entire story could focus on the helmeted hornbill, which was our original intention.”In the end Tim’s persistence yielded depictions of a range of helmeted hornbill behaviors, including some that had never been documented on film to this extent. And although we didn’t end up needing those other hornbill photos, those birds are so striking that we wanted to share them here.",
"A Kermode bear, also known as a spirit bear, climbs a crab apple tree to grab its fruit in the Great Bear Rainforest, in British Columbia. These rare white bears are sacred to First Nations people.KLEMTU, GREAT BEAR RAINFOREST, BRITISH COLUMBIAThere are stories about the white bears that hide in the deep forest of British Columbia’s coast. Old stories, handed down from one generation to the next for thousands of years, since the last Ice Age gripped the world, and glaciers licked the edge of the rain forest.One tale, told by the Kitasoo/Xai’Xais Nation, says that as the sheets of ice began to retreat, Raven—the creator of all things—made the animal known as the spirit bear to remind him of the ice and snow. It’s a story that speaks not only to First Nations’ connection with wildlife but also to their deep roots in the Great Bear Rainforest, an area the size of Switzerland that’s home to some 20,000 First Nations people.Yet in the 1980s when Doug Neasloss, the elected chief of the Kitasoo/Xai’Xais, was growing up, he never heard the origin story of the spirit bear. In fact he never heard of spirit bears at all because for decades the stories about these white-coated relatives of black bears were kept secret. Elders feared that if word of their existence spread, spirit bears—like black and grizzly bears—would be pursued and killed by fur trappers or trophy hunters.So in the late 1990s when Neasloss was starting to work as a wildlife guide and his boss told him to go out and look for a white bear, he was skeptical. You guys are out to lunch, he remembers thinking—there’s no such thing as a white bear.But Neasloss dutifully ventured into the bush. He was just unzipping his trousers to relieve himself when a ghostly bear padded into the forest and lay down on a bed of moss 30 feet in front of him. The bear began gnawing on a salmon it had caught in a nearby stream, unconcerned by Neasloss’s presence. A ray of sun momentarily broke through the clouds. “It was magical,” he says.Spirit bears, also known as Kermode bears, are among the world’s rarest ursines, found only in the remote archipelago of British Columbia’s central coast. They’re a subspecies of the black bear, born white when two dark-furred parents carry an obscure genetic mutation. The British Columbian government estimates there are 400 spirit bears in the province, and hunting them is illegal. (Learn more in National Geographic Magazine’s 2011 feature article “Spirit Bear.”)A spirit bear cub huddles with its sibling. For many years First Nations people kept the existence of the white bears secret. Elders feared that if word of them spread, they would be pursued and killed by fur trappers or trophy hunters.It wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say that Neasloss’s encounter with that bear helped redirect the fate of his community. At the time his hometown of Klemtu was struggling with about 80 percent unemployment and a host of social ills. The tiny town—on an island only accessible by plane or boat—was still struggling to recover from the loss of its fish cannery decades before, and logging companies were pressuring local officials to cut down the surrounding rain forest to create jobs.  Neasloss had another idea. He believed the forest was worth more intact, and the bears it sheltered—grizzly, black, and Kermode—were worth more to the Kitasoo/Xai’Xais alive than killed by trophy hunters. If Klemtu capitalized on tourists’ fondness for bears and invested in the ecotourism beginning to take hold in the region, perhaps the village could bounce back without sacrificing its natural resources. It was worth a shot.In 1999 Neasloss helped launch the Spirit Bear Lodge from a little red-roofed float house anchored at Klemtu’s docks. Today a luxurious new lodge accommodates visitors from around the world, most of whom come to tour the nearby islands in hope of spotting and photographing bears. All profits go to the tribe. Ecotourism is Klemtu’s second-largest industry, and unemployment has fallen to 10 percent.Doug Neasloss, elected chief of the Kitasoo/Xai'Xais Nation, helped launch the Spirit Bear Lodge, in Klemtu, which jump-started ecotourism in the region.In part because of this growing dependence on ecotourism, and because of their long-standing connection to the land, Kitasoo/Xai’Xais was one of 27 First Nations that negotiated with the Canadian government to permanently conserve 85 percent of the Great Bear Rainforest. Finalized in 2016, the Great Bear legislation was a success for both indigenous activists and international environmental groups. (See spectacular photos that reveal the newly protected Great Bear Rainforest.)But in Neasloss’s view it had one gaping hole: It failed to end trophy hunting for grizzly and black bears.The Kitasoo/Xai’Xais and other Coastal First Nations have never signed treaties giving up their land rights, and in 2012 they decided to ban trophy hunting in their traditional territories. The British Columbian government, however, exerts legal jurisdiction over much of the Great Bear Rainforest, and despite the nations’ ban, the provincial government has continued to issue tags and licenses to kill grizzly and black bears for their heads or fur. Many indigenous people consider this an affront to their sovereignty and values.“Our people do not believe in killing an animal unless it is taken for food,” says MaryAnn Enevoldsen, elected chief of the Homalco Nation, which runs a grizzly-viewing area about 200 miles south of Klemtu. “We can show thousands of people the bears in their natural habitat without harming or stressing them out. On the other hand, the ‘pleasure' of killing a bear only happens once and gratifies a few individuals.”A Kermode bear eats a fish in a moss-draped rain forest. The Kitasoo/Xai’Xais Nation has been fighting to make their forest off-limits to hunters and instead promote bear-viewing tourism.A study by the Center for Responsible Travel found that in 2012 visitors to the Great Bear Rainforest spent 12 times as much money on bear watching as on trophy hunting—and Doug Neasloss’ experience suggests that the two activities cannot co-exist. Several years ago, he was leading a group of tourists among the maze of islands near Klemtu when he glimpsed something dark and motionless in a river estuary. He thought it might be a dead seal. As he nudged the boat closer for a look, the object resolved into the headless carcass of a grizzly. His clients were horrified. Neasloss says hunters make bears more skittish, which means tourists are less likely to see them.  According to the British Columbian Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations, and Rural Development, some 250 of the province’s 15,000 grizzlies are killed by hunters each year, nine in the Great Bear Rainforest. Hunting the province’s 100,000 black bears is also allowed, but there’s no annual quota system. Government officials have long claimed that the number of bears killed is sustainable, but some First Nations' biologists question the government's science.Among them is William Housty, a biologist with the Heiltsuk Nation. Housty says that while government numbers are rough estimates extrapolated from a few overflights, his own department led a six-year, boots-on-the-ground mapping project using grizzly DNA that found wide variation in bear populations, especially as salmon runs have declined in recent years. (A spokeswoman for the provincial government agrees that DNA-based inventory is the “gold standard” and says her department welcomes peer-reviewed science from First Nations to augment its own estimates.)Nonetheless, in reaction to a growing public outcry, British Columbia has announced that it will ban trophy hunting for grizzlies in the Great Bear Rainforest beginning November 30. Neasloss and others say this is welcome news for Coastal First Nations—but it doesn’t mean the fight to protect the bears of the Great Bear Rainforest is over.For one thing there are still too few wildlife officers to enforce hunting regulations, which means much of the work will continue to fall to the Coastal Guardian Watchmen, a network of First Nations people who monitor, patrol, and enforce indigenous laws in parts of the Great Bear Rainforest that are too remote for federal or provincial officers to reach regularly. The Kitasoo/Xai’Xais are ramping up their Coastal Guardian Watchmen presence to deter poachers in the waning days of the grizzly hunt, but their efforts alone cost some $210,000 a year—a fraction of the funds activists say the network needs.Kermode bears are found only in the remote archipelago of British Columbia’s central coast. A genetic mutation in some black bears gives Kermode bears their white fur.In addition, as long as the British Columbian government continues to allow trophy hunting for black bears, Neasloss’s work isn’t done. That’s because black bears here are the progenitors of the spirit bears. “Every time you issue a tag for someone to shoot a black bear, it could be carrying the recessive gene that produces the spirit bear,” he says. He’s currently meeting with government officials and working with other First Nations to convince the province also to ban trophy hunting for black bears in the Great Bear Rainforest.For many First Nations people, ending trophy hunting isn’t just about saving wildlife or benefiting from the money bear-viewing brings to their communities. It’s also about cultural survival. Like many indigenous people, First Nations in the Great Bear Rainforest were marginalized for much of the past two centuries. Traditional religious ceremonies called potlatches were banned by the Canadian government until the 1950s, and sacred regalia was burned as punishment for holding them. Thousands of children were sent to live at government-run “residential” schools, where many were physically abused and forced to abandon their culture. Languages, food, customs, stories, and rituals were all but lost.Crab apples are a favorite food of British Columbia’s spirit bears. The coastal town of Klemtu used to have an unemployment rate of 80 percent, but bear-viewing ecotourism has helped reduce it to 10 percent.Today, First Nations up and down the coast are reclaiming their culture, and bear-based ecotourism is a part of that. Many tribes are rebuilding the “big houses” where potlatches and other ceremonies are held, sometimes with money earned from tourist operations.Coastal Guardian Watchmen are reconnecting with their traditional lands as they patrol for illegal hunting. And elders no longer fearful of poaching are starting to share the sacred stories about bears they’d kept silent for so long.Just down a gravel road from the Spirit Bear Lodge is Klemtu’s big house, a massive cedar building constructed in 2001. It’s perched at the edge of the sea, surrounded by mist-shrouded cedars and spruce trees, with an opening in the roof to let out wood smoke. Inside, 24-year-old Barry Edgar is giving a tour. He talks about a new online database that’s preserving digital recordings of traditional stories and about the new generation of children who will grow up hearing ancient tales about Kitasoo/Xai’Xais’ unique relationship with bears, told beneath the carved totem poles of the big house.  “Culture is like a flower," Edgar explains as visitors snapped photos of the intricate carvings. “It needs to be in the sun to thrive. Tourism helped us survive because it forced us to remember things.”Krista Langlois, a freelance writer based in southwest Colorado, writes about science, the environment, and social justice for High Country News, Outside, Adventure Journal, and other publications.

"Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., calls the Great Bear Rainforest "the planet's last large expanse of coastal temperate rain forest." Stretching for more than 250 miles along the coast of British Columbia, the 21-million-acre wilderness is sometimes called the Amazon of the North. The vast, sodden land encompasses 1,000-year-old cedars, waterfalls spouting off the sides of moss-covered mountains, granite-dark waters, and glacier-cut fjords. This remote expanse is home to many First Nations communities as well as abundant wildlife: coastal gray wolves, grizzly bears, Sitka deer, cougars, mountain goats, orca, salmon, sea lions, sea otters, humpback whales, and its most celebrated resident, the rare, cream-colored Kermode bear, or sprit bear, considered sacred by the T'simshian people. (Spotting a spirit bear takes a lot of patience, even more luck, and the expert tracking skills of a local guide.)When to Go: From late August to the middle of October, thousands of returning salmon draw wildlife to the local rivers, making this the best time to view grizzly bears and the elusive Kermode bear. Trout fishing is in season year-round, and different Pacific salmon species run the rivers from April through October.Where to Stay: Built in 1929 as a hunting lodge, Tweedsmuir Lodge has 11 chalets and cabins (most facing a central lawn) on 60 wilderness acres in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park. From late August to mid-September, guests can take guided grizzly bear-viewing float trips on the bordering Atnarko River. King Pacific Lodge is a luxurious, floating, 17-room resort anchored in Barnard Habour along the shores of Prince Royal Island. Open June to September, the lodge is accessible only by floatplane. Rates include transportation, gourmet meals, and guided tours. Spirit Bear Lodge, a tour/lodging outfitter in Klemtu, is owned and operated by the local Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nations community. To stay at the waterfront lodge, constructed in traditional west coast First Nations longhouse style, reserve a spot on a three-to-seven-night Spirit Bear Lodge bear viewing and cultural heritage tour.How to Get Around: Since many areas are accessible only by floatplane, booking an all-inclusive tour covering transportation, meals, and lodging is the most convenient option. Pacific Coastal Airlines operates direct flights from Vancouver to the Great Bear Rainforest communities of Bella Bella, Bella Coola, and Klemtu. BC Ferries offers a summer-only ferry service to many local communities through its Discovery Coast Passage. Other water-based options include Maple Leaf Tours' sailboat-based guided excursions and, in late August and early September, small group standup paddleboarding (SUP) expeditions led by Canadian paddleboard athlete and racer Norm Hann.Where to Eat or Drink: If you're a sport fisherman, you can drop off your catch for processing in Prince Rupert at Dolly's Fish Market (it's a depot for St. Jean's Cannery & Smokehouse) before chowing down on the fish 'n' chips—lightly battered and fried local halibut or ling cod chunks served piping hot with homemade fries and a Caesar salad. Dolly's is a working market, so the restaurant side is simple, compact, and usually packed in summer. Go light on breakfast and head to Dolly's before 11 a.m. for an early lunch. Local favorite Bella Coola Valley Restaurant is a burger joint in Bella Coola. The eclectic breakfast-to-dinner menu options range from pancakes to chow mein, but stick to the beef burgers: thick, juicy, and with toppings galore. Frequent visitor Kalen Morrow recommends the restaurant at Prince Rupert's Crest Hotel for its halibut steak and "panoramic view of the harbor. It's my hidden secret gem, but the new Wheelhouse Brewing Company is an up-and-coming competitor." She suggests their juniper ales if they're available.What to Read or Watch Before You Go: The Great Bear Rainforest: Canada's Forgotten Coast showcases more than 150 photographs, as well as journal entries and maps from conservationists Ian and Karen McAllister's sailing odysseys along the western Canadian coastline.What to Buy: At Petroglyph Gallery in Bella Coola purchase masks, paddles, and jewelry crafted by the people of the Nuxalk Nation. Baskets and hats woven from red and yellow cedar and spruce root by Tsimshian, Nisga'a, and Haida artists are among the handcrafted First Nations pieces available at the Museum of Northern British Columbia in Prince Rupert.Helpful Links: Great Bear Nature Tours, National Geographic article, National Geographic map of the areaFun Fact: In what was considered a landmark agreement, a major portion of the Great Bear Rainforest, five million acres—almost the size of New Jersey—was declared off-limits to loggers in 2006.",
"Wadi Rum is Jordan's largest valley. Many visitors walk or drive through this rugged landscape, but by horseback might just be the way to go.If you’re planning a trip to Jordan, it’s likely that a visit to the archaeological wonder and UNESCO World Heritage site of Petra is already on your itinerary. After crossing that must-see off your list, check out some of the many lesser known activities worth experiencing in this Middle Eastern country. Here are six unexpected things to do in Jordan.Work alongside Yousef Sayyah, a beekeeper in Um Qais, for a unique experience that teaches teamwork, conservation, and more.Community-based tourism activities are growing in Jordan—which is good news for visitors and locals alike, as both groups can benefit from the cross-cultural exchange and economic opportunity. Don a beekeeper suit in Um Qais and accompany bee enthusiast Yousef Sayyah as he tends to his bee colonies and teaches about teamwork, conservation, and the healing properties of natural bee products. Tag along with a shepherd near the Dana Biosphere Reserve to better understand the Bedouin life. Or learn to cook Arab dishes in local family kitchens in Amman, Um Qais, and Orjan.For a different experience in Wadi Rum, let Arabian horses lead you in an equine-assisted “soul session.”Jordan’s rugged landscape naturally entices intrepid travelers seeking outdoor adventure. But this ancient place is also steeped in a spirituality so salient, you may be inspired to embark on an introspective journey as well. Head to Wadi Rum, where you’ll find a handful of Arabian horses and their trainer, Sandra Jelly, ready to lead you in an equine-assisted “soul session.” According to Jelly and other equine trainers and mental health professionals, horses are herd-minded and have an innate ability to act as mirrors. When you step into the stable, they believe that these gentle giants reflect your inner workings and worries, giving you the chance to identify limiting beliefs, address issues that arise, and (re)discover your most authentic self.If you assume that desert dominates the landscape of this Middle Eastern country, you are correct. About 75 percent of Jordan is indeed considered desert. But that means there’s still 25 percent left to surprise you. Visit Jordan in the spring months (March to May) and you’ll find the fertile hills of the northern highlands bursting with brightly colored blooms. Take a self-guided stroll along the trails or hire a local guide who can offer cultural and historical context and help you identify wildflowers along the way, including Jordan’s national flower, the black iris. Unsure where to start? The Um Qais to Fuheis section of the Jordan Trail offers ample opportunities to enjoy a kaleidoscope of springtime colors.You might expect alcohol to be outlawed in this Muslim-majority country. It’s true that most restaurants don’t offer alcoholic beverages and it’s illegal to buy or sell alcohol on Muslim holidays (with the exception of some international hotels). But alcohol is, in fact, available in some supermarkets, select restaurants, and liquor stores in Jordan. For a one-of-a-kind intoxicating experience, head to Fuheis. Just 25 minutes north of Amman, this Christian town is home to Carakale, Jordan’s first and only craft brewery. Here you can take a brewhouse tour and sample handcrafted beers in the tasting room or on the open-air terrace overlooking Blue Canyon. Further north in Mafraq (about 1.5 hours from Amman), Zumot Winery awaits. During the summer months (April to September) you can request a private tour of the vineyards and a poolside wine pairing on the property.The open sky around Wadi Rum is perfect for stargazing with a candlelit dinner.Sometimes the best activities are the ones you won’t find widely advertised. Select tour operators in Jordan (such as Experience Jordan, In2Jordan, and Engaging Cultures) can arrange unique VIP experiences. For an unforgettable evening, request a private candlelit dinner in the Nabataean caves of Petra or under the desert stars in Wadi Rum.If tackling a thru-hike is on your to-do list, consider the recently opened Jordan Trail. Traversing the length of the country from north to south, this 400-mile path weaves its way along heart-stirring scenescapes, up and down challenging and ever-changing terrain, and through some 52 towns and communities. Stroll through pine forests, ascend some of the steepest wadis (valleys), and trek across open desert—all on your own two feet. Experienced hikers can go it alone and at their own pace with the help of downloadable maps and GPS navigation, while those looking for a designated support team, preplanned itinerary, and hiking companions can join a group.Writer Sunny Fitzgerald scans the landscape of Zubia and Bergesh along the Jordan Trail.",
"If you close your eyes and picture the Middle East, windswept desert dunes probably come to mind. While this region certainly has incredible sandscapes worth wandering (and we’ve included some here), it’s also home to a hypersaline lake, Technicolor valleys, and geological formations so fantastical you might feel you’ve arrived in a fairy-tale land or left Earth entirely. Here are a few of the many majestic natural wonders of the Middle East.Once upon a time, some 30 million years ago, a volcano spewed ash across the land now known as Turkey. So begins the story behind the enchanting fairy chimneys of Cappadocia. The ash transformed into tuff—porous rock made up of volcanic debris and compacted ash that, as it turns out, was not so tough after all. Time and nature took their toll, wearing away at the softer stone, leaving spire-shaped pillars of stronger stone such as basalt behind.The only skyscrapers you’ll find on Hormuz Island are nature-made mountains and salt domes, where large amounts of rock salt have been pushed up through the planet’s surface.This tiny geological gem located in the Persian Gulf is proof that big things can indeed come in small packages. Nearly every inch of Hormuz Island’s 16 awe-invoking square miles imparts a story of its formation. The only skyscrapers you’ll find here are nature-made mountains and salt domes, where large amounts of rock salt have been pushed up through the planet’s surface. Further exploration of the island reveals a sort of geographic gallery where you can admire some of Earth’s art: Valley of the Statues is home to rocks weathered into fantastical shapes, and the multihued Rainbow Valley is painted red, orange, white, blue, and purple by naturally occurring minerals.The imposing peaks and craggy cliffs of the canyon that cuts through the Jebel Qaraqir plateau dwarf the cars and visitors that visit.The imposing peaks and craggy cliffs of the canyon that cuts through the Jebel Qaraqir plateau are plenty impressive on their own. But the unexpected hero of this dramatic Saudi Arabian desert scene is a spring-fed stream that consistently delivers water, splashing refreshing shades of green—in the form of grasses, shrubs, and palm trees—against the orange and yellow-colored sandstone canyon canvas.The high salinity of the Dead Sea makes it naturally floatable for humans.The high salinity of this landlocked lake—located at the lowest point on Earth and bordered by Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian territories—makes the Dead Sea naturally floatable and healing for humans, yet uninhabitable for fish, plants, and other water-dwelling creatures (save some bacterial species and microbial fungi). Freshwater flows in, though in dwindling amounts these days, from rivers and natural springs found on the lake floor, and with no outlet, salt and other natural minerals are left behind when water evaporates in the intense Middle Eastern sun.The Jeita Grotto is a popular spot for visitors to Beirut. Check the water levels ahead of time if you want to take a boat ride.Don’t judge this natural wonder by its artificial exterior. Once you enter Jeita Grotto, just north of Beirut, you’ll understand why this karstic cave system is a top tourist draw. Examine (at a safe distance, of course) its natural stone curtains, columns, and candles in the cathedral-like atmosphere created by the stalagmites and stalactites of the upper cave. Then, water levels permitting, let the placid vibe of a boat ride in the lower cave transport you to a silent subterranean world where you can catch a glimpse of a Pisa-like leaning stalagmite and see striking limestone formations—some still growing each day and others formed as far back as the Stone Age—reflected on the surface of the water.Soak in the vast desert landscape of Wadi Rum, broken only by sandstone pillars and large goat-hair tents of the Bedouin tribes that live nearby.Ancient sandstone pillars stretching up from the red sands toward an endless sky create a sublime setting in Wadi Rum, Jordan’s largest valley. Walk among these towering rocks that have been carved and curved by eons of wind, sand, and flash floods and you’ll feel as if you’ve traveled to another planet. In fact, this Mars-like landscape is so extraterrestrial it has even stood in for the red planet in The Martian and as the fictional moon Jedha in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Rub al Khali, or "Empty Quarter", is the name given to the world's largest contiguous sand desert in Oman.The staggering size and inhospitable conditions of this wonder—the world’s largest contiguous sand desert—earned it the name Rub al Khali, or “Empty Quarter.” A 255,000-square-mile sea of sand, Rub al Khali covers nearly a quarter of the entire Arabian Peninsula, with 80 percent in Saudi Arabia and the remaining 20 percent spilling into parts of Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Wadis likely delivered much of the red-colored sands, and it’s possible that some whiter sands blew in from the floor of the Persian Gulf. Winds continue to shape the dunes into various and picturesque forms, including steep star dunes and crescent-shaped barchan dunes.Sunny Fitzgerald is a freelance writer, sustainable travel specialist, Lonely Planet Local, and a regular contributor to Kama`aina Magazine.

"A massive concrete wall looms oppressively over Bethlehem’s horizon. Many tourists flock to the city, curious to see the biblical birthplace of Jesus in a grotto under the sixth-century Church of the Nativity on Manger Square, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Instead of finding Christmas card-worthy surroundings of fields and shepherds, an imposing structure—planned to stretch a total of 440 miles and at some points, reaching up to 26 feet tall—divides the landscape.“The wall is part of the history and everyday life of the local population,” explains Jerusalem native and National Geographic Explorer Aziz Abu Sarah. “It evokes strong emotions and opinions in Israelis and Palestinians for different reasons. You can explore many aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian narratives and conflict by visiting the wall.”Foreign visitors take tour buses or taxis the short six miles from Jerusalem, riding along the blank wall that Israelis started building in 2000, justifying it as protection against terrorism. It’s necessary to show identification at a guarded checkpoint, restricting movement of Israelis and Palestinians. Considered racial segregation and apartheid by Palestinians, the wall on the side of the occupied Palestinian territories is covered in vivid, anarchic graffiti in protest.“I aim to show the artistic aspect of the conflict, resistance through graffiti, painting, and colors,” says Israeli photographer Yoray Liberman, who traveled to Bethlehem, the epicenter of Palestinian tourism. “I also reflect the impact the separation wall has upon the landscape, the ecology and nature, to emphasize how big and massive the wall is in comparison with human beings.”The visual spectrum of political views reach Manger Square, where taxi drivers hawk rides to see the most famous works of art by elusive British street artist known as Banksy, who used the wall as a canvas to bring awareness to the ongoing conflict since 2005. There’s the pigtailed girl frisking a soldier, a dove protected by an armored vest, and other provocative works. This year, Banksy encouraged even more people to come by opening the Walled Off Hotel right next to the border, where guests can stay the night in an art-filled hotel bragging the “worst view in the world.” Next door a graffiti shop charges guests to add their mark by supplying stencils and paint.Beyond the city’s artistic narratives, locals offer their own unique and diverse perspectives. While taxi drivers tell stories of their life in Bethlehem while showing passengers the wall from a hill’s vantage point, organizations offer visits to local families in a refugee camp. Guests on the National Geographic Expedition in the Holy Land hear a unique dual narrative provided by both Israeli and Palestinian guides, trained by cultural educator Aziz Abu Sarah.Some tourists intend to visit the wall, while others just pass by on the way to more enjoyable places to visit, like the exceptional stepped landscape of Battir covered in olive trees and grape vines, the renowned food scene of Nablus, or the winding alleyways of the oldest town in history, Jericho. Tourists should head to the wall for a deeper understanding of how the structure affects the lives of millions that live near it, and then explore the region beyond.Yoray Liberman is a photojournalist based in Tel Aviv.

"When intensive modern farming started, there was a staggering 120 cubic miles (500 cubic kilometers) of water beneath the Saudi desert, enough to fill Lake Erie in the U.S. But in recent years, up to 5 cubic miles (21 cubic kilometers) has been pumped to the surface annually for use on the farms. Virtually none of it is replaced by the rains, because there effectively are none. Based on extraction rates detailed in a 2004 paper from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, the Saudis were on track to use up at least 96 cubic miles (400 cubic kilometers) of their aquifers by 2008. Experts estimate that four-fifths of the Saudis' "fossil" water is now gone.That means oe of the planet's greatest and oldest freshwater resources, in one of its hottest and most parched places, has been all but emptied in little more than a generation.There are no rivers or lakes or areas of abundant natural vegetation because rainfall is scant to non-existent. Over the centuries, through oases and then desalination plants, the Saudi people have found enough water to support their daily lives. But a relatively recent national effort has brought changes to the desert and created much greater demands for water resources. Zooming in on certain areas shows that there are indeed regions of intense greenery that nature did not create.From the sky, the Saudi landscape is checkered with green, showing farm fields made possible by irrigation. Enormous buildings nearby house tens of thousands of milk cows, whose drinking and cooling needs are prodigious. The water to perform these miracles in the desert is pumped from far below the surface, from aquifers filled thousands of years ago, when the climate in Saudi Arabia was much wetter. Water in this most improbable place gave the nation the hope to achieve its long-sought goal of feeding itself rather than importing food from other countries. However, this solution has a limited lifespan and the end is near.Saudi Arabia sits on two pools of liquids – water and oil. The oil, in world-leading volumes, has paid for the enormous cost of pumping the water to the surface for agriculture and the raising of livestock. Oil revenue continues to grow for the time being, but the water supply is rapidly diminishing and the Saudi government has decreed only a few more years will be devoted to growing wheat. The country is now directing its massive wealth towards buying land and growing crops in other, more verdant nations.",

"Through virtual reality, travelers can “experience” far-flung destinations, such as coastal Tanzania, with minimal environmental impact.This Earth Day, people who usually celebrate by heading outdoors might need to rely on virtual tours instead. It will be a fitting opportunity to experience a technology that some experts have advanced as an eco-friendly solution to the problem of overtourism.With about 90 percent of the world under a travel restriction, many would-be adventurers are turning to virtual reality (VR) to bring them to Machu Picchu or the Galápagos Islands. The potential for this technology to ease tourism’s carbon footprint is clear, underscored by some of the unexpected ecological benefits the coronavirus lockdown has surfaced—including cleaner air and water.Even as it has eased pollution, the pandemic has been devastating for the tourism industry. But will interest in traveling virtually last beyond the pandemic? And will VR technology sustain growing interest?For years, airlines, travel agencies, and tourism boards have used VR technology to market destinations to potential customers. Now, “the impact of COVID-19 may allow [virtual reality] to shake off its image of being a gimmick,” says Ralph Hollister, a tourism analyst at Global Data and author of a report on the VR travel industry.Virtual travel experiences are seeing a surge in popularity. Valeriy Kondruk, CEO of VR travel company Ascape, has seen app downloads grow 60 percent from December (traditionally the busiest month) and double since January. The company has fielded increasing interest from educators and those working in nursing homes, Kondruk says, even as the airlines and travel agencies that usually license Ascape’s VR content have paused their accounts.For overcrowded destinations including Machu Picchu, virtual reality experiences could help divert some tourists, easing the burden on the location’s infrastructure.Related: Had to cancel your vacation? Here’s what to do next.Still, there’s a big gap between using virtual reality to “try before you buy” and treating virtual reality like the destination itself. To start with, the technology isn’t ready yet. 360-degree virtual reality videos are usually experienced through a headset (like Oculus Rift) or an app (like Google Cardboard). The headsets are expensive, heavy, can cause nausea, and aren’t comfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes. The apps have none of these problems, but simply aren’t as impressive, says Hollister.Limited sensations are another hurdle. The videos focus on sounds and sights but can’t do much with smell, touch, or taste, and VR experiences tend to only be a few minutes long—hardly the equivalent of a two-week vacation in Spain. Of course, some researchers are working on ever-more-immersive VR features, including haptic suits, says Samuel Greengard, author of Virtual Reality. But while creating a full-body suit with enhanced sensory experiences might make a video of the Amazon or Antarctica more realistic, it still doesn’t fulfill the deeper needs that compel us to travel.Tourists aren’t locals, and they aren’t business travelers. Tourists tend to be less directed in their explorations and more focused on new experiences and discoveries. “This simply can’t be recreated in virtual reality,” says Erick Ramirez, a philosopher at Santa Clara University who studies VR.He compares the future of virtual travel to a classic thought experiment: Imagine that you could hook yourself up to an “experience machine” and simply feel happy forever. Philosopher Robert Nozick, who developed the experiment, “thinks nobody would want to be hooked up to such a thing,” Ramirez says. “I do think that there are some kinds of tourist experiences where the value in them is in the doing, not just in the seeing and hearing, and it’ll be tough for VR to replicate.”We not only want to do things, we want to be the ones deciding what to do. On a fundamental level, virtual travel is constructed and fed to us; we see a world only to the extent that someone was able to film and engineer it. It is, as Ramirez puts it, “the most authoritarian of guided tours.”Virtual reality extends only as far as it’s engineered. In a virtual experience, you can’t choose to wander down a side street and discover a charming café—unless those options have already been programmed.Someone going to India for real can decide where to go and what to see. They can be surprised by themselves and by what they learn. Someone going to India via video might never see aspects that a VR production company obscures in order to create a more pleasant experience. “A tour that Elon Musk—just to pick on somebody—might design would look very different from what a working-class Indian living in India might design,” Ramirez says. “It’s important to keep that in mind as we go into these touristy VR experiences.”Related: Meet the Indian women taking on a male-dominated travel industry.For my part, I experienced VR travel in 2015, using Oculus to demo a short tour of the north coast of Vancouver, British Columbia. The demo was beautiful and looked similar to the real place, which I visited four years later. In other ways, though, there was little comparison. Part of the difference was sensual: the air was cold on my skin and I could touch the water. But much of the difference was the specificity of my own actual visit. In person, the experience was happening only to me, I had full control over what I was able to hear and see—and if I wanted, I could see and choose something else.Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc, a Paleolithic cave painting site in southern France, is too vulnerable to be visited in person. A nearby replica allows tourists to see copies of the paintings in a way that presages the potential of virtual reality travel experiences.Virtual reality may never replace traditional travel, but it still offers intriguing possibilities. If the technology becomes sophisticated enough, the more environmentally conscious among us—especially those aiming to reduce our carbon footprint (or people sensitive to flight-shaming)—might prefer this form of escape. VR travel does bring parts of the world to people who are physically unable to visit certain landmarks. Most of all, it could help bring people to places that are otherwise inaccessible.Southern France is the site of some of the world’s earliest cave paintings, which are closed to the public because the Palaeolithic works are so delicate. Yet only four miles from the original a complete replica is on view. Ramirez suggests that virtual reality could be applied in a similar way—and even more accessible way—to sites around the world. Hollister, from Global Data, agrees that VR can play a unique role in recreating historic attractions. And Kondruk, the CEO of Ascape, says that the company has been working with Vietravel, a major Vietnamese travel agency, on recreating areas of the country where the government has limited tourist travel.Related: See mesmerizing photos of Vietnam from above.Ultimately, the impact of virtual reality on travel will be determined by the evolution and application of new technologies. So far, advances have been incremental—and not at a scale that is likely to disrupt the travel industry or support a drop in travel-related carbon emissions after the pandemic has ended. But just as travel platforms, from print to social media, offer some of the discoveries of actual exploration, virtual reality might bring faraway places closer—and in so doing encourage travelers to embrace sustainable practices wherever they choose to go (or not go) in the future.",
"Travelers around the world are scrambling to get home. But what do you do if your trip never got off the ground?What’s a traveler to do when the next destination is a short hop to the kitchen or a long weekend in the living room?For many in the travel and tourism industry, the first priority during the coronavirus pandemic has been helping tourists return home as travel bans take effect and countries enact measures to limit public contact. But for the countless people whose vacation plans were canceled before they could even get off the ground, the best advice is to stay put. Here’s what to do you if your trip’s scrapped—and how to make the most of staying home.A frustrated vacationer’s first thoughts might be about getting their money back, but it can be tough to untangle itineraries that took months to assemble. Airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and tour companies are offering different refund options, some under policies that change by the minute. As businesses scramble to save profits—particularly airlines, which are staring down looming bankruptcy—some travelers are left in the lurch.Tiffany Hines, who runs the Athens, Georgia-based travel consultancy Global Escapes, recommends checking your airline’s policies to see what refunds, vouchers, or other compensation is on offer in exchange for a canceled trip. If you booked an Airbnb, you’ll likely get your money back—though the company’s policy puts the onus on hosts to pay up. Even if you purchased travel insurance for your trip, be aware that policy benefits don’t always cover every aspect of your booking.In many cases, prepare to get only what you can bargain for. And don’t be afraid to seek advice and allies. Hines has offered her company’s expertise to travelers even if they weren’t previously clients, and she suggests other companies might be willing to do the same.“We can read between the lines [of cancellation policies] and provide insight,” Hines says. “You may have looked at our services as an extra cost, but in the end, it can save you so much time and headache and worry and stress.” Another bonus? Building a relationship with travel advisers gives you an advantage when the storm clears and the industry is flooded with rebookings, Hines says.“It’s a human crisis,” says travel adviser Tiffany Hines about the coronavirus pandemic. “And we need to be human” when dealing with trip cancellations.As iconic destinations sit eerily empty, some thwarted travelers are turning to their own backyards in search of places to discover. The temptation to get outdoors is powerful, but are local trips a good idea? It depends.Ditching the city for the great outdoors might not effectively “flatten the curve”—that is, keep the daily number of disease cases at a manageable level for medical providers. Parks can offer open space and social distance. But unsafe exposure is still a risk on crowded tours and at viewpoints and visitor centers—a risk disproportionately shouldered by low-wage hospitality and sanitation workers, according to the Guardian, in a report describing packed scenes at Big Bend and Zion National Parks this week.A few national monuments and recreation areas have closed their gates in response to COVID-19, but the National Park Service has drawn criticism for opting not to shutter heavy-hitters such as Yosemite, Yellowstone, and the Grand Canyon. Instead, NPS is merely restricting operations—and waiving entrance fees, CNN reports.In some places, the decision to venture out is moot. In California, six counties in San Francisco’s Bay Area have enacted sweeping “shelter in place” measures—the country’s strictest—ordering 6.7 million people to stay in their homes. Though there’s no magic number when it comes to a safe gathering size, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends restricting gatherings to fewer than 50 people, while the White House says that through April 1, all gatherings of more than 10 people should be canceled or held virtually to prevent the virus’s spread.The best advice is to look at the CDC’s risk assessment. Do you have underlying conditions? Are you more vulnerable or would your trip threaten others who are? Individual circumstances vary, but you might need to postpone your commune with nature. If you go anyway, make sure to maintain social distance and take other preventative measures.So, you’re stuck at home. What now?Just as technology has made remote work more feasible, it also offers the chance to travel without leaving your couch. For about as long as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have been around, people have used the tech to prepare for vacations: taking a digital walk through airports, exploring a hotel ahead of time, even previewing a lavish meal.But in a time of pandemic, virtual tourism could help replace the vacation itself. Pull up a 360-degree video on your smartphone, and you can hurtle down a snow-covered mountain in a wingsuit, roam the ancient Maya city of Chichén Itzá, or even explore the surface of Mars. Want a more sedate pace? Take a virtual tour of a world-class museum.Some travelers have even argued that, pandemic aside, virtual experiences are a more responsible alternative to overtourism, since they can ease the infrastructure demands and carbon footprints of actual travel. Virtual reality may even expand travel opportunities in years to come, as researchers focus their work on experiences that are expensive, dangerous, rare, or even impossible in the real world. Bucket-list items such as whale-watching or seeing the Sistine Chapel could become accessible to everyone—with all the thrills but very few of the environmental impacts.The benefits of virtual reality also extend to how travel makes us feel, says Sarah Hill, who develops AR/VR experiences that change in response to customers’ lowered heart rates. Hill’s first project provided VR encounters to ailing veterans unable to travel to see memorials to their service. She discovered that the technology not only provided psychological comfort, it also helped relieve physical stress.As lockdowns and self-quarantines confine people to close quarters, “finding ways for your brain to escape and travel is not only important, but therapeutic,” Hill says. “We all need some virtual peace. This is a walk in the park for people who can’t take a real walk in the park.”Alas, even virtual experiences can fall short in recreating a real sense of place. Sometimes the best option is curling up with a good book.“There’s nothing like a book to immerse you instantly in the culture and history of a place,” says Amy Alipio, National Geographic travel editor and resident bibliophile. “So if you can’t head to Paris for spring break, maybe tuck into Little by Edward Carey, a curiosity-filled novel about the life of Madame Tussaud, set in the years before and during the French Revolution.”Her other recommendations: Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, Alexandra Fuller’s memoir of farm life in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); Aravind Adiga’s prize-winning tale of an Indian chauffeur-turned-entrepreneur, The White Tiger; and Without You There Is No Us, a look at North Korea’s rising ruling class for which author Suki Kim lived undercover in Pyongyang for three months.If cabin fever is still creeping in for you and your family, just keep reading. You can replace your canceled spring break trip with one of these page-turners. Can’t get to your favorite national park? Try these books instead. Or dig into 12 years of the National Geographic book club’s favorite recommendations.When the best way to protect ourselves and our communities from a global pandemic is to stay at home, Emily Dickinson’s words may be truer than ever: “There is no Frigate like a Book / To take us Lands away.”Ninth-century illuminated manuscripts and the earliest known architectural plan drawn on parchment are just some of the literary treasures at the resplendent 1,200-year-old Baroque-style Convent of St Gall in Switzerland.",
"Two massive lockdowns are already under way—the entire country of Italy and China’s Hubei province, both home to some 60 million people. Governments there have set drastic limits on domestic travel and social gatherings and have shuttered businesses and schools in a desperate effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The geographic size of these two areas may appear small compared to the U.S., but when studied by population, a different picture emerges.Some form of restricted zone encompassing 60 million people in the United States would cover all the citizens in California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona combined—or an entire swath of the country directly to the east of those western states. (Coronavirus is officially a pandemic—here's why that matters.)The sweeping measures in Italy and Hubei province are focused on severely restricting travel first and foremost. The restrictions vary but are geared toward keeping people in their homes and avoiding movement as much as possible. Public transport, from buses to planes and trains, has been curtailed or, in some cases, shut down entirely. Highways might be manned by checkpoints. Italians, for example, must get official permission if they need to travel within the country for work, health, or any other significant purpose. Schools are closed as are businesses, except those considered essential, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. “Social distancing” measures include businesses that are allowed to stay open enforcing a three-foot distance between customers. China’s clampdown began January 23 and quickly widened throughout Hubei province, a drastic move but one that is appearing to help, as the number of cases has been falling there. Italy’s countrywide limits, announced March 9, came as regional restrictions failed to stem the contagion and health systems became increasingly strained.The designated “containment area” in New Rochelle, New York, calls for less drastic measures but is the first officially controlled zone in the U.S. All schools, houses of worship, and other public spaces are shutting down and large gatherings are banned. Free movement, however, is allowed. The National Guard has come in to disinfect common areas and to distribute food where needed; the containment area has a one-mile radius. (These are the people most at risk of becoming infected.)",
"In advance of new travel restrictions taking effect in Italy March 8, a passenger waits for a train out of Milan’s main train station.It was supposed to be the spring break trip of a lifetime—a family excursion to Tokyo for California’s Jessie Nagel, her husband, and their 14-year-old daughter, who is obsessed with Japanese culture.The Los Angeles family had a multifaceted vacation booked: a boat ride past the cherry blossoms of Chidorigafuchi Park, a tour of Harajuku, a stroll along the Nakamise shopping street, and a concerted effort to eat ramen and okonomiyaki (savory crepes) across the neighborhoods.Then COVID-19 started to spread, and everything fell apart.The more reports of cases coming out of Asia, the more concerned Nagel became that they might become infected if they traveled there. She also worried about the overall experience. Friends both at home and in Japan suggested that sites might be closed, and that streets could be eerily empty because locals would be staying indoors. And then Nagel started to fear being quarantined upon returning to the U.S., just because of where the family had traveled.Ultimately, Nagel, the head of a communications agency, pulled the plug.“We canceled our hotel without issue, but now I have to find out about the flights,” she said on March 4. “We got a very good deal—a total of $1,800 for three of us—but that’s still a lot to lose.”Nagel and her family aren’t the only travelers scrambling to rethink or rebook spring break itineraries.Some, like Nagel, have canceled to minimize risk. Others are engaged in a game of wait-and-see, busily compiling components of a Plan B should the spread of the coronavirus get worse. Still others have sworn off travel all together—at least for the foreseeable future. And a few adventurers are pressing on, despite what they hear about the spread of the virus.The situation is daunting. At press time, the World Health Organization (WHO) had recorded more than 120,000 cases of the virus and more than 4,000 deaths. While most cases have been reported in Asia—the disease was first reported December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, China—WHO had identified cases in at least 111 countries.What’s more, on March 8, the U.S. State Department warned that U.S. citizens should not travel on cruise ships, where many cases have incubated. (Find out how to stay healthy on a cruise ship.) On March 9, Italy became the first Western democracy to put an entire country on lockdown since World War II.And on March 11, U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. would ban all travel from Europe for 30 days beginning March 13 (though the U.K. would be exempt). March 12, Viking and Princess canceled all cruises until at least May.In Italy, which has been hard hit by coronavirus, attractions like the Pompeii Archaeological Park have seen tourist crowds drop by more than 75 percent.Workers disinfect the church of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples on March 6.According to experts, signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The official website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the virus is most dangerous for the elderly and those who have chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease.For all of these reasons, many colleges have canceled study abroad programs for the spring. Large events are being scrapped, too: on March 6 organizers of the annual SXSW music, technology, and film festival in Austin, Texas, called the whole thing off for the first time in its 34-year history.It’s all prompted some travelers to swap one itinerary for another.Take New York City resident Vanessa Wise. She, her husband, and their three boys (ages 13, 10, and 6) were planning to spend spring break in early April in Palm Springs, California, and at Disneyland. As they saw big companies tweaking plans, the family pivoted, canceling their original lineup and booking Plan B at a small resort in Long Boat Key, Florida.Delta waived all change fees on the flights, but Wise said, ”I gladly would have paid the fees for increased peace of mind.”“I’m still nervous about travel with three kids, but want to live our lives and not be freaks,” said Wise, a development executive at a nonprofit. “With everything that’s going on we didn’t want to go [to a place from which] we couldn’t get home by car if we had to.”Within the travel industry, organizations have been quick to sound alarms, even if they haven’t gone so far as to make recommendations about spring break.For instance, the Family Travel Association (FTA)—an organization that works with vendors serving families— issued a statement on Facebook March 1 that essentially encouraged families to stay abreast of updates from WHO and take precautions to minimize exposure.Executive Director Colleen Hodson said that while FTA cannot advise anyone on what is the right choice for their family, it can provide calm and coherent suggestions. “Traveling with children during a period where many are fearful of possible health risks—however remote—is always extremely personal,” she said. “We suggest families traveling with children check in with their pediatrician before going, consider [what the situation is] where you are traveling to, and purchase travel insurance.”Family physicians also encouraged caution.Dr. Elisa Song, a pediatrician in Belmont, California, recommended that parents be “rationally cautious” as they react to coronavirus news, and that they minimize their chances of infection with diligence, rest, and good hygiene. “Doing things like wiping down surfaces on the airplane, not touching your face, and hydrating will make a difference,” she said. Song, who runs the blog Healthy Kids Happy Kids, also counsels keeping other healthful habits on track, virus risks or not. So don’t reward your kids for good hand-washing hygiene with a bag of candy, since Song says research indicates sugar suppresses the ability of white blood cells to fight infections.Learn where to sit on a plane to minimize exposure to germs and viruses.Song also noted that evidence suggests nasal irrigation with neti pots or portable misters can reduce the colonization of different viruses. “When we get off a flight, we irrigate our noses with saline to flush out any viral particles that may have taken hold,” she said.Still, some travelers are undaunted. Matt Swenson, an editor who lives in Alpharetta, Georgia, said he and his wife were forging ahead with plans to take their two young children (ages 6 and 4) to New York City for spring break in early April.Swenson said that he lives 40 miles from one of the world’s busiest airports (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport), and notes that, “the disease could just as well be at the local supermarket.”He added that he and his wife are “always harping on the kids to wash their hands anyway.”Even with a similar plan to keep exposure risk low, California’s Noelle Thill says she’s not sure she’ll go through with her family’s spring break plans in late March. She, her husband, and their two daughters (ages 15 and 10) currently are scheduled to visit Disneyland for three days, but because her younger daughter has asthma, Thill doesn’t want to take chances.“If more cases come forward in the next few weeks, we will probably cancel,” said Thill, who lives in Healdsburg. “We’ll see what next week looks like. We’re re-evaluating every day.”",
"Sometimes the best-laid trip plans get waylaid by illness, accidents, and world events. Travel insurance can help, but read the fine print.You’ve dreamed about this vacation for months, maybe years. You’ve researched it. You’ve saved for it. And now, due to reasons out of your control, you have to bag it.That scenario can hit anyone at any time. But over the past few weeks, it’s happened at an unprecedented rate as countries race to contain the spread of coronavirus. The virus has upped the risk factor for virtually all forms of travel. And in response to the constantly evolving crisis, airlines and hotels have become increasingly flexible about rebooking and credits, so it may be possible to rescue your plans—if you wait on hold long enough.It’s also made a lot of folks wonder: Would I not have to worry about this if I just bought travel insurance?According to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association, Americans spent nearly $3.8 billion on travel protection plans in 2018, up from $2.8 billion in 2016. Those numbers are likely to spike even higher this year due to anxiety over coronavirus. But as everyone in the travel industry has been repeating, insurance won’t necessarily help right now, even if you bought it long before Purell was selling out in stores.Find out why washing your hands was once controversial medical advice.“Fear is never covered,” explains Helen Prochilo, a Long Island travel agent. So if you want to bail on a trip because you think you could potentially get sick, you’d better have a Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) policy. While the cost of a standard policy usually starts at about five percent of your total trip cost, a CFAR policy tends to push that up by about 50 percent. To insure your $6,000 summer trip to Norway would cost as little as $300 without CFAR, but would likely be upwards of $450 with it. In exchange, holders can recoup up to 75 percent of their losses as long as they back out of their trip at least two days before departure.Prochilo usually needs to break the bad news to her New York clients that they are barred from purchasing CFAR, but New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on March 6 — in light of complaints due to coronavirus — that residents will now have that option. (But, at least for now, these policies are only available from a handful of insurers and remain somewhat tricky to get.)These super-flexible policies make sense to Consumer Federation of America insurance expert Doug Heller. “A consumer can understand them,” he says, noting he’s purchased a CFAR policy when buying plane tickets to a meeting that seemed likely to get canceled. Want to find a regular policy that otherwise covers such a commonplace issue? Good luck. “My problem with travel insurance is that usually, it’s not worth it because of the narrowness of the coverage,” he explains.Some credit cards include travel insurance, but ask a lot of questions before relying on them.Calculating whether to shell out for any insurance depends on both how much the trip costs and the value you place on your peace of mind, notes Prochilo. She tells clients that if they can afford to lose everything they paid for their trip and foot the bill for hospital bills in another country, then they don’t need insurance. Although she doesn’t sell insurance, she often finds herself having to explain it to travelers, who generally are uneducated about their options. She recommends that clients call insurance companies to ask specific questions before buying. “It’s confusing even to us,” she says.The biggest reason people rely on their policies is due to illness, Prochilo says. The problem might arise beforehand, say breaking an ankle the day before a big ski vacation. That’s when trip cancellation protection can be handy.But Prochilo’s most dramatic client stories come from incidents when folks need to rely on medical coverage. One man got in a moped accident in Bermuda and racked up thousands of dollars in bills. Another client ended up in a hospital in the Dominican Republic for parasites. In situations like these, she says, having no international health coverage is a major problem. And that’s pretty common for Americans. (For example, Medicare covers very little abroad.)An American couple on a cruise in Mexico last year made headlines when their trip to the emergency room left them trapped until they could pay a $14,000 bill. Filmmaker Tyler Perry came forward and covered their bill, and they came home. But in case you don’t want to depend on a celebrity intervention, a travel insurance policy could also do the trick.Find out how not to get sick on a cruise ship.The key? Read the fine print, says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of Travelinsurance.com, one of several websites allowing customers to compare policies from multiple providers. Others include Squaremouth.com and Insuremytrip.com. Type in your destination, travel dates, total cost, and age of travelers, and these sites offer policy options at various price points. (You’ll notice prices shoot up for those over age 70.)Policies greatly differ by how much protection they offer, Sandberg says, so it’s important to do your research—and do it early. To nab a CFAR policy, for example, you need to lock it in within a certain number of days after the initial trip deposit date. If you have health problems, you’ll likely want a policy with a pre-existing condition waiver. Traveling to a remote corner of the world? Make sure the emergency evacuation coverage is high.Trip cancellation tends to be the priciest element of travel insurance, Sandberg says. If you want a cheaper option that just covers medical care and evacuation, enter a trip cost of $0 when you calculate or purchase a policy.Annual subscription options are available for frequent travelers. Some companies specialize in emergencies, such as Medjet, which, in addition to catering to business and leisure travelers, offers membership for expats and students studying abroad.Doing such a deep-dive analysis isn’t likely when you’re clicking a yes/no box after buying a plane ticket, says Heller, who notes that online travel websites often steer customers to a particular insurance plan and policy. “It’s bought without shopping most of the time,” he says. “The reason those companies get on the website for Expedia is they’re paying—call it ‘commissions’ or ‘kickbacks.’”If you do your homework on insurance, you may find you’re already covered by your credit cards. Some of them pay out for trip cancellation and interruption, delayed and lost baggage, rental car collision damage, travel accidents, and more.Heller says he reviews his contracts before a trip so he knows exactly what each card can offer in a specific situation. That way he knows which card offers the best protection for care rentals, flight cancellations, or whatever. “It’s worth educating yourself on the phone. It’s hard to read these policies even for someone who knows the industry,” he says.But don’t just assume your card has enough coverage, warns Prochilo. She had a client planning a $14,000 cruise who insisted her credit card would protect the trip no matter what happened. Then Prochilo checked her policy. It had a cap of $3,500. The client purchased travel insurance, which turned out to be a smart choice when her husband developed pneumonia right before the trip.",

"If you drive slowly through the village of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue on a weekday afternoon, things are so quiet you may hear the Provençal version of the proverbial pin drop: the cork popping off a wine bottle in one of the town's drowsy bistros. Come on a weekend, though, and you'll find parking so tight you may have to leave your own rental car on a country road and hike back into town.Weekends are when the town's market and antique shops are open (in addition to the artisanal shops, also open on weekdays, that sell regional fabrics, ceramics, and foods, as well as chunky blocks of purple soap that distill the perfume of area lavender fields). And L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue isn't alone. Just about every village in Provence boasts its own workshops and boutiques dedicated to the local specialty, so a leisurely four-day drive through southern France offers the ultimate souvenir crawl. You can stop and start anywhere along the route. While you'll be taking in all the classic craft towns, don't call the circuit a shopping trip. You'll also be sampling a quintessential slice of Provence, as the two-lane rural back roads wind past olive groves, cherry orchards, vineyards, and the stony medieval hilltop towns. Even better, you'll be discovering one of the epicenters of authentic European artistry, and you'll be supporting an exuberant cultural legacy that still defines Provence.Start the Provençal version of a grand tour in Avignon. If you grab the two-and-a-half hour TGV express train from Paris's Gare de Lyon station (reserve your seat in advance) you'll be in Provence by noon. Once there, rent a car (try Europcar at the rail station). In town, order the prix fixe lunch (if you're lucky it will include the signature terrine of duck foie gras) on the terrace of the venerable Christian Etienne restaurant (10 rue de Mons, www.christian-etienne.fr) and then walk next door to the Popes' Palace where the Roman popes temporarily decamped in the 14th century. The Palace, stripped down to its austere bones during the French Revolution, is now a maze of elegantly unadorned chapels and banqueting halls. But it breaks loose with a very earthy surprise in the basement, where you'll find something you don't usually expect from a religious landmark: a wine cellar and sommelier. "Every spring all the best wine producers of the surrounding Côtes du Rhônes villages send us samples from their vineyards, " says sommelier Eric Sigmann, "and a panel of 30 experts chooses the best wines of the year. This year 350 samples were sent into us and we selected 63 of the most amazing wines to sell, at the producers' own prices."That kind of purist regard for Provençal artisanship is visible a few blocks away at Les Délices du Luberon (20 Place du Change; www.delices-du-luberon.fr/boutique_us/liste_rayons.cfm?code_lg=lg_us), along one of Avignon's crammed shopping streets, where jars of regional olives, olive oil, and tapenades include manager Magali Caire's favorite "tapenade noire a la Provencal" (a blend of black olives, anchovies, and garlic that pretty much squeezes the essence of the local table into one small jar).From Avignon head 16 miles (25 kilometers) southeast on the N7 (then switching to the D907, the D900, and the D938) to L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue for another lesson in regional taste but come the day before the hectic Sunday market. Saturday is when Michel Biehn opens the doors of his Virginia creeper-covered townhouse cum shop, La Maison Biehn (7, avenue des 4 Otages), and lets you unfurl the region's best-edited collection of brightly colored Provençal textiles. "They're hand-blocked printed cotton called ‘les Indiennes' because they came from India through the port of Marseille, as early as the 16th century," says Biehn, the kind of passionate collector who has written books on the subject. "Suddenly even poor fishwives could dress in colors that used to be reserved for royalty. What a joy." Biehn stocks antique wedding quilts printed with garlands of flowers in the trademark Provençal colors—the purple of lavender, yellow of sunflowers, and gray-green of olive leaves—that made the area a muse for artists like Van Gogh, Matisse, and Cezanne. If the 18th-century originals are too pricey (and a good quality Venetian yellow quilt can easily run 2,000 euros) Biehn also continues the tradition by commissioning newly printed les Indiennes fabrics, pillows, shirts, and boutis—a quilted, three layer bedspread—splashed with the red poppies and yellow hibiscus that bloom near his window.Continue heading east another 18 miles (28 kilometers) (take the D901 to the D900, then turn left on D149) to the hill town of Roussillon, a rose-colored beauty spot framed by red-ocher cliffs. Then prepare for the most dramatic drive, a 65-mile (104-kilometer) version of a carnival ride (follow the D900 through Apt, then switch to the N100, right on D907, right to D4, left on D82, and the remaining way on the D952) that leads you along narrow, corkscrew mountain roads, past the valleys and bluffs of the Alpes de Haute-Provence region, until you reach Moustiers-Ste-Marie. The village perches so precariously on its cliffside that it looks ready to tumble and splinter, though that's fitting; in a town known for its fragile craft—the vividly colored, glazed ceramic called faïence—everything seems breakable. How did the effete art form, a court-favorite at 18th-century Versailles, become synonymous with a rustic mountain village? "We had to work harder to produce the shiniest glaze because Moustiers was so small and remote," says Isabelle Bondil, who sells faithful faïence reproductions, thrown by her brother Philippe in his village workshop, at her family-owned Bondil a Moustiers shop (Place de l'Eglise). There are the traditional flowers, birds, and mythological scenes, painted on plates, vases, and urns, along with the Oriental figures favored by Marie Antoinette.More contemporary, candy-colored faïence plates also land on the terrace tables of La Bastide de Moustiers (Chemin de Quinson, www.bastide-moustiers.com), a gourmet inn opened by global top chef Alain Ducasse. The rustic getaway settles on its own perch just below Moustiers and shows off another regional craft: the updated Provençal cuisine that chef Wilfrid Hocquet produces, working with the tomatoes—actually 42 varieties of them—that grow in the Bastide's own garden, along with the ripe local larder of eggplants, lamb, berries, goat cheeses, and seafood (if roasted langoustines pop up on the menu, order them).The Bastide itself, a stone country house framed by olive groves, guarantees a hushed night's sleep before you head back west, 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of Avignon, to Les Baux-de-Provence (the 97-mile/156-kilometer route—the most direct—follows D952 west to E712, then E80 to N569, D113, D5, D17, and D27). Just outside Les Baux you will pass the Moulin Castelas (Le Mas de l'Olivier; www.castelas.com/GB/indexGB.html) olive grove, where you can pick up tins of the silky Castelas olive oil before you reach the town parking lot.Another vertical village, Les Baux-de-Provence, climbs up to the ville morte (the dead town), a former village from whose spectral fortress ruins the medieval lords of Baux once dominated more than 80 Provençal towns and cultivated a chivalric society famous for its troubadours and courtly etiquette. But not everything is embalmed here. Just below the ville morte is the newer (by Provencal standards) but still medieval, and fully alive, Les Baux, where you can fortify yourself with a lunch in the garden courtyard of Café des Baux (Rue Trencat). Don't stop there though, before your 22-mile (35-kilometer) drive back north to Avignon (taking the D27 to the D78F, the D17, the D33A, the D33, the D32, the D570N, and finally the N570). The best Les Baux landmark may be the Santons D'Arts (Rue de L'Orme) where the Peyron-Campagna family, including mother Jacqueline and son Fabrice, produce another local specialty. Santons, the terra-cotta, hand-painted miniature figurines that depict regional society, are made everywhere in Provence, and the studio's highlight is its clay women—a whole matriarchy of fishwives and dairy maids that will look oddly familiar after your long drive. That's because the cheese-makers, lavender vendors, and spinners echo the world of artisans you've just visited, as well as something more. They are also Jacqueline and Fabrice's unwitting self-portrait, the mirror of devoted craftspeople determined to keep passing on their own singular gift.Spring, summer, and fall are all delightful times to visit Provence.

The full 224-mile (360-kilometer) loop described above begins in Avignon, heads east through the villages of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Roussillon, and Moustiers-Ste-Marie, then circles back west through Les Baux-de-Provence to Avignon again.—Text by Raphael Kadushin, adapted from National Geographic Traveler",

"The first thing I learn in French Polynesia is how little I need. A swimsuit is enough.Ten years have passed since my last visit to the island of Moorea—a decade of longing to return to the color and clarity of this wide-open world in the South Pacific where nature dominates. After dropping my bag of unnecessary things at my beachside bungalow, I head to the sandy lagoon, easing into water as warm as a bath.Halfway between California and Australia, French Polynesia isn’t a singular sensation but a mosaic of moods spread across 118 small islands and atolls (67 inhabited) and more than a thousand miles of ocean. It’s not a place of museums or hot spots, but rather an elemental destination of earth, water, air, fire, and something else even more elusive that I always feel but can barely explain. So I set out to find it again.I use my hands as much as my feet to hike up into the tropical highlands of Moorea, in view of sister island Tahiti, a short ferry ride away. Pulling on smooth vines and hopping mountain brooks, I tromp upward through a rain forest of cool shadows and diaphanous orange and red flowers. To an outsider the plants are so outlandish they nearly seem fake, but my hands and nose let me know that everything is real.My guide, Heinrich Tamatoa, knocks his fist against a gigantic furrowed tree trunk. A deep and bellowing boom echoes through the woods. “This is the mape tree—Tahitian chestnut,” he says, “carried to this island by the first Polynesians.” These ocean voyagers likely originated from Southeast Asia more than a thousand years ago, bringing with them taro and breadfruit, as well as pigs, dogs, and chickens.Like a skeptical kid, I knock the hollow tree and another boom bellows skyward, past the high canopy of ancient wood. Tamatoa knows the name of every plant, tree, flower, and shrub, in French and Tahitian, as well as in the four other languages he speaks in his work as a guide. He knows the plants’ history and how they’re used. There are teas that promote health, leaves to make hats, and trees for building a canoe that will cross the ocean.“For us Polynesians, nature is not separate,” Tamatoa explains. “We belong to the Earth.” The way he says it, I know that it’s not just a line that he feeds tourists, but something he believes personally. “I’m a hiking guide because I like being in the forest,” he says. “I like showing visitors our nature—how green and alive our island is.” Tamatoa is a French citizen, his passport emblazoned with the stars of the European Union, “but,” he insists, “I am a hundred percent Polynesian.”Flowers and leaves are placed as sacred offerings at a stone marae (temple).Island riches lured Europeans and Americans to Polynesian shores. The legendary mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty took place after a layover in Tahiti. A deserter named Herman Melville jumped ship in the Marquesas and the experience inspired his first book. The long colonial struggle for control was finalized in 1880, when the king of Tahiti ceded these widely scattered islands to France. Almost 140 years later, parliamentary elections showed a span of attitudes toward France, with a strong vote of support for the independence parties. But it wasn’t enough to beat the status quo, whose campaign tagline politely proclaimed, Continuons Ensemble, or Let’s Continue Together.It takes more than an hour hiking uphill to reach the knife’s edge of Moorea’s volcanic ridge, a steep black basalt wall. From the narrow lookout at Trois Cocotiers (Three Coconuts), I can see the whole of Moorea: the heart-shaped island, the gleaming turquoise of Opunohu Bay, and the unbroken carpet of green that sweeps from the shoreline up to the cartoonish peak of Mount Rotui.Jagged mountains, dark volcanic soil, and steep rain forests exert their own power. Only from on high do I realize that land may be the forgotten element in the South Pacific, where neon blue lagoons dominate travelers’ Instagram feeds.Every island in French Polynesia is unique, each with its own personality and affiliation to one of five island groups. Tahiti and the other Society Islands are the most visited, the Marquesas the most northerly, the Tuamotus the flattest, while the more southern Austral and Gambier archipelagoes remain virtually unvisited by foreigners. The biggest mistake a traveler can make is not to get past the romance of Tahiti or the honeymooner overwater bungalows of Bora Bora or even the emerald green Moorea. The Polynesian voyager spirit compels travelers to explore beyond each new horizon, and it’s that same spirit that pushes me to Huahine, a lesser known but lush garden isle bursting with jungle and giant flowers and top-heavy banana trees.A quick plane hop northwest of Tahiti, Huahine has a gentle and unassuming air about it. Tourist formalities vanish so that, after a day, I feel a part of village life. Strangers hand me snacks of fresh pineapple and cut-open coconuts for me to drink. I am offered rides to islanders’ favorite spots: “Right here is the best place to watch the sunrise,” says an older lady who insists on driving me out of her way before bringing me back to my hotel, pointing out the flowers along the way—pink and white, bushy and fragrant, growing year-round in the living earth.Sunrise is even more memorable underwater. Seventy feet below the ocean surface, suspended in the clear void outside Moorea’s reef, I focus my gaze on the 10-foot lemon shark just below me. Striped pilot fish hang about the timid giant, then scurry after him to darker and less conspicuous depths. I twist backward and see a parade of blacktip reef sharks following me like curious groupies.National Geographic photographer David Doubilet's mission to document the world's coral reefs led him to Fakarava Atoll, in the Tuamotu Archipelago, where hundreds of sharks gather to feed.My dive buddy, Mana, motions me forward, and we soar like slow dolphins over a coral meadow that glows with all the colors of cotton candy. Silvery fish, purple-tipped sea anemones, and giant clams fill the frame of my mask, an epic reminder that life is pulsing below the waterline.Mana helps me back into the boat, where the captain is sitting back in his chair, singing softly and strumming a song on a Tahitian ukulele. “Mana means ‘life force’ in our language,” says Mana, explaining his name as we head back to shore. “It’s lucky to have a dive buddy that has mana—life,” he jokes.In French Polynesia the ocean has great mana, from the gleaming black pearl inside a quivering oyster to the turtles and rays that hover in the shallows. At times it feels like nature is begging to connect, often when you’re least expecting it. My friend Helga told me about how, in Moorea’s Opunohu Bay, a magnificent juvenile humpback crashed a snorkeling party. “This huge and friendly creature stared right into my eyes,” she said. “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I could snorkel with a whale.”Tahitian Angelo Faraire rides the legendary wave at Teahupoo, on the southeast end of Tahiti island.The abundance, accessibility, and scale of sea life make these islands an underwater paradise. For rare and natural encounters, in-the-know divers have discovered the Tuamotu Archipelago. Its Rangiroa and Tikehau islands offer amazing biodiversity, even for casual snorkelers, while serious shark fanatics flock to Fakarava. The long and wispy atoll seems barely wide enough for my plane to land, but inside the lagoon, the dark blue world transforms into a swirl of schooling sharks: tigers, hammerheads, tawny nurse sharks, and blacktips. Indeed, Fakarava lagoon is home to the highest concentration of gray reef sharks in the world; it’s where hundreds of the sleek animals dance in a slow-moving circle, following the contours of the island and utterly ignoring me. The scene is hypnotic; only the bubbles of my own breath clue me into my outsider status—bubbles that rise up to the golden surface and measure the distance between two worlds, water and air.Poisson cru is a typical Tahitian dish made with marinated fish, such as tuna, and coconut milk.The warm ocean wind smells like ice cream. That is my first impression of Tahaa, a round-shaped island blanketed by vanilla farms. I think back to the times I have read “Tahitian vanilla” on some store label or restaurant menu; but here, the scent is homegrown. Vanilla is part of the landscape and the air I breathe. Even my clothes smell of vanilla—just one of the many treasures from the islands, along with coconut oil and incomparable black pearls.The air carries all the aromas of Polynesia. Vanilla, yes, but also jasmine and the tantalizing and unique scent of the national tiare flower—a calming, sunny, lemony perfume. A garland of flowers is draped around my neck each time I set foot anew on an island. The hei (similar to the Hawaiian lei) is a sign of welcome, along with the light French kiss on both cheeks.Sometimes the air feels ripe and heavy with humidity, and other times it’s a mild and constant breeze that tickles my neck and rustles a row of palm trees. Rainbows often paint the sky, arriving and fading by the hour.At his workshop in Tahiti, Woita Prokop creates jewelry and art from shells and pearls.“I love the rainbow of history we have,” a new friend tells me. His name is Marurai Trafton. “White, black, Chinese, Polynesian—we all live together and share our different stories,” he says. “When you live on such a small island, you have to take care of your community, your family, your neighbors, and everyone you live with.”This is the heart of Polynesian culture, he explains. “You don’t have to spend a lot or do anything special. Just say Ia Orana [hello], take off your shoes indoors, and listen to others. On our island, when you don’t have money to give, you just give your time. That is how you show your respect.”The spinning torches are a blur, blinding my eyes to the dancers in the dark. From my seat on the beach, I can feel the heat of the fire as the flames streak through the blackness, scrawling strange letters of light that vanish in the night. Like tattooed ghosts, the dancers’ faces flash in the orange blaze of the fire, their chants repeating a story that I have never heard but that tingles my spine all the same.Every dance, every motion carries meaning. Despite centuries of Christian missionary influence and a population collapse brought on by diseases introduced by Europeans, the dances have survived in the Marquesas. Remote even by South Pacific standards, these islands maintain traditions that have disappeared elsewhere.“The early missionaries outlawed all this—the tattoos, the dancing. They made the people cover their bodies and hide their culture,” says a Tahitian friend, Jack Lord. “If not for the Marquesas, all of this would be lost.” Marquesans proudly held onto their traditional beliefs long enough to fuel a cultural revolution that still burns across French Polynesia today.Fire made these islands, one by one—millions of years of explosions erupting from the deepest part of the Earth. High islands like the Marquesas reflect younger volcanoes, while the low, flat atolls of the Tuamotus are all that remain from older, sunken volcanoes, ringed by coral reefs that now lie flat, as if floating on the ocean surface.On July 2, 2019, a solar eclipse will pass directly over the Tuamotu Archipelago, completely darkening the sky for about three and a half minutes. When the moment of darkness passes, the ultimate fire—the sun—will return, moving through the sky, just like the spinning torches of fire dancers at night.I am a foreigner and may never understand the true meaning of mana. But already I know that it alludes to an invisible element of these extraordinary islands. “It is all around us,” says Marurai, “in all the things we cannot see. It is my energy, your energy, how we feel toward one another.” Another friend, Gina Bunton, says, “I feel mana at sunrise or sunset, or every time I arrive on one of our islands. Mana is all around me. It’s what links me to my fenua—my country.” Even the Postimpressionist artist Paul Gauguin sought out mana when he arrived in 1891, seeking an escape from “everything artificial and conventional.”The traditional Marquesan patutiki inspires contemporary tattoos, and travelers can receive a permanent souvenir, custom-designed by artists who know how to tap the secret language of symbols into the skin to carry mana from the artist to the recipient. Traditional tattoos become an outward symbol of a person’s mana.Upscale bungalows at the Intercontiental Moorea resort greet sunrise.Mana is also power, something real that you sense on the Society Island of Raiatea, a spiritual home for Polynesians, less than an hour’s flight from Tahiti. I walk around the weathered stones of the ancient Taputapuatea marae, an outdoor temple of sorts where Polynesian chiefs and priests and navigators met and learned and worshiped. Some historians believe that from this island the early Polynesians set off in migrations that led across the Pacific, from Hawaii to New Zealand and as far as Easter Island.I may not be sure what mana is, but I can feel it here, where the white waves spray onto the hand-carved stones. I feel mana in the bright Milky Way that lights the sky at night in the Tuamotus. I see mana in the flying fish that bounce over the sea swell, in the cautious eel hiding in the red-orange coral, and in the billowy white dresses of women on their way to church. I hear mana in the stories told around the fire, in birdsong, and in the all-night strains of a beachside ukulele jam. All the mana I have felt stays with me, even now, after I have left—calling me back to an island where I need nothing else.",
"The Marquesas Islands are part of French Polynesia and yet proudly apart. You won’t find overwater bungalows and turquoise lagoons on these 12 volcanic islands, six of which are inhabited. Instead, the Marquesas feature green peaks that plunge directly into the sea, waterfall-laced valleys, and dramatic rock spires. In addition to this rich natural heritage, the Marquesans are active in keeping alive distinctive cultural traditions in tattooing, dance, language—and horse riding.Horses were introduced to the island of Ua Huka in the mid-19th century, a gift from French admiral Abel Dupetit-Thouars, who brought them from Chile. Islanders tamed and adopted them over the years, and they became the perfect transport for traversing roadless valleys, steep slopes, and high ridges. Horses enabled islanders to range widely in their hunt for wild goat and pig, which are traditionally slow-cooked in an umu, an underground oven.After a night of bivouac on the crests of Ua Huka with his sons, Vohi gathers the horses in preparation for their return to the valley.Along with the meat from hunting, and the islands’ abundance of breadfruit, coconut, mango, banana, and other tropical fruits, and the sea’s bounty, Marquesans have long “had a very good living from the land,” says photographer Julien Girardot. Nowadays, with the introduction of cars and roads, he says, “almost every Marquesan goes with a Japanese pickup to the shop to buy rice, pasta, and frozen chicken from the U.S.” Yet, there are still people, he says, who resist the islands’ globalization and continue a generations-old horse culture.In a series of photos, Girardot, who has lived in French Polynesia for the past seven years, tells the story of three horsemen: Vohi Brown of Ua Huka, and Lucien “Paco” Pautehea and Jérémie Kehuehitu, who both live on the island of Hiva Oa.Marquesan horses love large leaves from the uru, or breadfruit.On Ua Huka, wild horses outnumber the inhabitants. Vohi, who has an image of a rearing stallion tattooed on his back, is especially skilled in capturing, taming, and training them. He tends to his stable of horses when he’s not working at local guest house Mana Tupuna Village or tending his crop of copra (dried coconut), from which coconut oil, one of French Polynesia’s top exports, is manufactured. And occasionally Vohi does lead visitors on horseback treks along the island’s arid uplands.The island of Hiva Oa may be known by Westerners—if it’s known at all—for artist Paul Gauguin, who spent the last years of his life here. But both Paco (who runs Hamau Ranch) and Jérémie lead horse treks that reveal what they know and love about their island: its lush landscapes fragrant with frangipani and tiare (the national flower of Tahiti); the sacred site at Meae Iipona, where ancient tikis brim with mana (spiritual power); and ridgetop views of the vast ocean, riding fearlessly to unknown horizons—just like the last horsemen of the Marquesas themselves.A group of wild horses runs through a falcata forest on the Hiva Oa plateau.",
"By now it’s likely your family has started practicing some kind of social distancing, voluntarily or not. School plays have been canceled, restaurants are far less crowded, and places of worship have gone digital. I’m even writing this from my couch as my office in Washington, D.C., has been temporarily shuttered for a few weeks.Then on Thursday, Ohio, Maryland, and Michigan became the first states in the country to mandate a statewide shutdown for all schools. And though kids might be thinking of this as a three-week-long snow day with endless playdates, parents are wondering whether that’s such a good idea.Experts are too, and there’s a lot of puzzlement on how much social distancing anyone should be practicing. But one thing they urge is caution and common sense.And just make sure to keep their hands washed and fingers out of noses!Having ‘The Conversation’: If you haven’t already, here are a few basic techniques on how to talk about COVID-19 with your kids. In short, be calm, meet kids where they are, and help them feel like they’re in control, writes Ruth A. Musgrave for Nat Geo. (This explainer for kids will help give the the basic facts.) Don’t sugarcoat it: Tell them they may get sick, and feel poorly for a while. They won’t be alone. They should know it likely will be a long haul, though perhaps you don’t dwell on these details.How one teacher told her students: “Misinformation can lead to stress, and stress can make it harder for children to learn,” writes Angela Sheffield, an Indiana public school teacher for the past 27 years. Sheffield developed a chart for students about what we know, told them about the importance of challenging stereotypes and refraining from derogatory comments and conclusions. She was transparent and honest about her fears—that the school might close if the outbreak hit their community. After every statement, she reassured students that, for now, they were going to carry on as usual, and she repeated: Education is the key.No, your dog won’t give you coronavirus: It’s inevitable, staying at home, that your family will have more contact with pets. Don’t worry, experts say the virus cannot be transmitted from your pet to you. However, the World Health Organization advises you to wash your hands with soap and water after contact. “It’s the pet owners, rather than pets, that have a higher risk of spreading the virus.” writes Youyou Zhou for Quartz.Boredom busters: Our Family Resources page has more on this topic, plus photo galleries, personality quizzes, and science experiments to help your kids keep their brains active.",
"Children might be getting used to life with coronavirus (as much as any of us can, that is). But when they hear news about things like President Trump testing positive for COVID-19, questions and concerns about the virus can bubble up again. That can be tough to talk about, especially when you probably have just as many questions and concerns."Kids need to feel safe and not worry," says Katie Ryder, a family medicine physician at Kaiser Permanente in the mid-Atlantic region. "That’s our biggest role as the trusted adults in children’s lives, to help them do that."Here are some tips on how to talk to your children about coronavirus.We know: Easier said than done. But kids pick up on how you’re feeling. If you’re showing panic or anxiety, so will they. Instead, validate their concerns to show that you understand why they might be nervous—and that a little nervousness is OK. "But it’s important for them to know that there’s no need to panic," Ryder says.Then talk calmly about what’s happening, and reassure them that people are working very hard to make things better. "Kids need to know that grownups are working together to make sure kids are safe," says Rebecca Goertzel, principal at Chautauqua Elementary School in Vashon Island, Washington, off the coast of Seattle.Very young children might not be asking any questions, and in that case there’s no reason to discuss the topic. But other kids will want answers, and parents shouldn’t shy away from talking about what’s going on. "Be honest," Goertzel says. "But don't scare them or become alarmist." Limiting exposure to television reports and social media—especially as the infection and death rates continue to increase—can help, since too much can get those active imaginations running toward something akin to a zombie apocalypse. (This coronavirus 101 written just for kids helps explain the basic questions they might have.)One of the best ways to calm children is to help them feel like they can protect not just themselves—but other people as well. Tell them that when they follow the rules for staying healthy, that helps other people stay safe since the child won’t be spreading the disease. "This is their job—to do what they already know they should be doing to keep themselves and others healthy," Ryder says. So as you remind them how not to get sick—wearing masks, washing their hands, sneezing and coughing into their elbows, not touching their faces—help them understand that these actions also protect others. (Here's an article on getting your kid to wear a mask and social distance.)The good news is that few children seem to be coming down with coronavirus, and when they do catch the disease, their symptoms tend to be mild. Explain to them that they’ve been sick before with similar illnesses, like the common cold or the flu, and that they’ve gotten better. Coronavirus is likely to affect them the same way. (Find out what coronavirus does to a child's body.)Still, they’re probably worried about other family members as well. Again explain that most adults with the disease have gotten better, and that doctors and scientists are working hard to protect everyone. As for missing grandma and grandpa? Comfort kids with plenty of phone calls and video chats to show them things are OK.Even though many children are doing some kind of remote learning and traditional playdates have pretty much been canceled, it’s important to make kids feel like their lives won’t be too disrupted. Establish a daily routine at home, and (following your doctor’s advice) continue doing normal activities like practicing piano, bedtime reading, cooking together, or even playing in the backyard.Consider adding new at-home activities at the same time every day, such as video chatting with grandma and grandpa, exercising (call it a dance party!), or crafting. Being cooped up and away from friends won't be much fun. "But by staying home, kids and families are helping," Goertzel says. "They're part of the solution."",
"When Dylan Ekins started kindergarten in Florida last year, he wore a mask over his nose and mouth. He and his older brother Carter had a collection of coverings ranging from prints with crayons to superheroes to movie characters.Building the collection wasn't a problem, but for their mom, Katie, getting the boys to wear them proved challenging.“We talked to Dylan about it and explained that he was going have to wear a mask,” she says. “He was not happy.”Experts are clear that wearing a mask, consistent handwashing, and social distancing are the trifecta that can help keep kids and the community safe from getting or spreading COVID-19. (Vaccines for kids 12 and older are key, as well.) That’s why many schools bringing kids back to in-person classes this fall will require masks, per recent CDC recommendations.But as parents know, kids aren’t always natural rule followers.“We’re not born knowing how to follow rules or expectations,” says Samanta Boddapati, a psychiatric and behavioral health specialist at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio. “So we need to think about prompting and coaching children so that they really understand some of these new expectations.”Whether your child is attending class, daycare, or after-school programs in person this fall, experts provide some advice on how you can make the new rules for school a little easier.Some children are very rule-bound and willingly compliant about rules in general. “Other children are more defiant and don’t like to be told what to do, be it wearing a mask, social distancing, or brushing their teeth,” says psychotherapist and parenting coach Alyson Schafer. “It’s not that the child has a particular hatred of mask wearing, distancing, or tooth brushing—they have a hatred of being controlled and ordered around.”Instead of setting yourself up as an adversary, Schafer says parents should seek to gain a child’s cooperation rather than forcing their compliance. One way to do that is to appeal to a child’s natural sense of kindness and altruism. Explain that adults need their help to keep the community safe and that this is their chance to be everyday heroes.“Kids have a high sense of social justice and want things to be fair for all,” Schafer says. “Parents can connect the dots for children. Say things like, ‘We wear masks and stay six feet apart because we don’t want to spread our germs to others who may not be as healthy. We wear our masks because we want to help everyone, not just ourselves.’”How you say it is important, too. “The more calm, confident and assured you are, the more likely they are to follow suit,” she adds.But don’t overwhelm children with these conversations. Instead, Boddapati recommends having routine check-ins about the rules.“Have those conversations about why you're wearing the mask as you leave the house,” she says. “Then it's not just asking a child to wear a mask—it’s an expectation that we have as a family when we're out in public.” (And yes, that means you have to follow the rules, too!)Even children who aren’t completely averse to wearing masks may balk when asked to wear it for an entire school day. And kids who’ve been away from friends for months will likely find social distancing hard. But experts say if they’ve had a chance to get used to the rules, they’ll be in a better space to keep the habit going.Have kids practice wearing masks a few times a day, gradually increasing the amount of time they wear them. For social distancing, use kids’ sense of play to help them remember what “six feet” looks like.“We know kids learn best through play,” Schafer says. “Come up with a fun game with your kids that teaches them how to stay on mark, or guesstimate six feet, and play it until they have some mastery that you can celebrate.” For instance, Red Light, Green Light and Simon Says teach listening and inhibitory behaviors.Then, take children on small outings and give them the power to decide if they’re willing to follow your requests to wear a mask and social distance. For instance, a trip to get ice cream can come with the rule that the child must wear a mask and social distance. If they refuse, that’s OK. But no mask, no ice cream.“The parent is not controlling the child’s behavior but controlling the situation instead,” Schafer says.That freedom to choose is crucial. This way, the child decides independently to follow the rules, not just because you’ve said so. Over time parents can increase the length and scope of those outings.When Carter had to consistently wear masks at his summer camp, Ekins realized his concerns weren’t about comfort. “He was very nervous about it,” Ekins says. “He thought he looked weird.”The family spent hours trying on lots of different masks to find ones that made him look “cool,” she recalls. That urge to belong is innately human, Schafer says.“We’re all motivated to be accepted,” she says. “We do this by imitating the group norms and watching behaviors and attitudes modeled by others.”Ekins says that once Carter saw that other kids his age were wearing masks at camp—and understood that it was a requirement to have fun—he felt better about the rules. It even helped him become a powerful ally when it came to his younger sibling.“He was even telling his brother, ‘You know, it's not that bad!’” Ekins says.Still, some children who your kid might come into contact with won’t be following mask-wearing rules. Empower them to handle those situations when you won’t be on the scene to offer advice by creating a list of possible situations, then brainstorming some responses.“It’s hard to think on your feet,” Schafer says. “It’s better to plan and rehearse scenarios so that when faced with a situation of someone not following the rules, we can respond in a thoughtful way that the child is comfortable with.”Schafer suggests using humorous retorts or ones that appeal to another child’s sense of kindness when they get too close:• “I have a family member who is high risk, so I just have to be extra careful.”• “Excuse my germaphobia—it’s just who I am.”• “Isn’t it frustrating when you forget your mask? I’ve done that, too.”• “Actually, I just ate too much garlic.”“Keep in mind what your child is trying to accomplish,” Schafer adds. “Being harsh or judgmental will invite defensiveness. Being kind and educative while staying safe is the aim.”The bottom line is for everyone—children and adults—to simply do the best they can as we all navigate this time of uncertainty. Says Bodapotti: “Having simple discussions, checking in with children, validating some of their concerns, and modeling some of the behaviors that you’d like for them is going to carry families a really long way right now.”Editor's note: This story was originally published on August 24, 2020, and has been updated to include recent recommendations.",
"Editor’s note: As of November 2021, this COVID-19 vaccine tracker is no longer being updated. Stay up-to-date on the latest vaccine developments and other COVID-19 news here.COVID-19 vaccines have reached consumers in record time. Though the process can typically take 10 to 15 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency authorization to vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson in less than a year. Before now, the fastest-ever vaccine—for mumps—took four years to develop in the 1960s.Fortunately, scientists had started working on the seeds of these vaccines long before COVID-19 emerged–teams were doing breakthrough work on mRNA technology for 12 years before the pandemic, and a global push to make clinical trials for COVID-19 more efficient helped ensure the world had safe, effective drugs in record time.Even after a vaccine is authorized or fully licensed, it faces potential roadblocks when it comes to scaling up production and distribution, which also includes deciding which populations should get it first—and at what cost.Here’s everything you need to know—including primers on how vaccines and clinical trials work, the latest news on vaccine distribution and safety, and a detailed breakdown of the early candidates.Vaccines go through a three-stage clinical trial process that’s required before they are sent to regulatory agencies for approval. Given the urgent need, some vaccine developers compressed the clinical process for SARS-CoV-2 by running trial phases simultaneously.Phase one: Checks the safety of a vaccine and determines whether it triggers an immune response in a small group of healthy humans.Phase two: Widens the testing pool to include groups of people who may have the disease or be more likely to catch it, to gauge the vaccine’s effectiveness.Phase three: Expands the pool up to the thousands to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective among a wider array of people, given that immune response can vary by age, ethnicity, or by underlying health conditions.The COVID-19 candidates, like all vaccines, essentially aim to instruct the immune system to mount a defense, which is sometimes stronger than what would be provided through natural infection and comes with fewer health consequences.To do so, traditional vaccines use the whole coronavirus, but in a killed or weakened state. Others use only part of the virus—whether a protein or a fragment. Some transfer the instructions for coronavirus proteins into an unrelated virus that is unlikely or even incapable of causing disease. Finally, cutting-edge vaccines under development rely on deploying pieces of the coronavirus’s genetic material, enabling our cells to temporarily make coronavirus proteins needed to stimulate our immune systems. (Find out more about vaccines and how they work.)Nucleic acid: Relies on injecting snippets of a virus’s genetic material, either DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA), into human cells. It spurs the production of viral proteins that mimic features of the coronavirus, training the immune system to recognize its presence.Knocked-out virus: Uses a non-infectious form of the coronavirus that can no longer cause full-blown disease but can still provoke an immune response. The virus can either be fully inactivated or weakened. These modes are considered the most classic ways to make vaccines.Viral vector: Essentially a “Trojan horse” presented to the immune system. One type involves introducing a piece of DNA from SARS-CoV-2 into another unrelated germ—for example, an adenovirus, which typically causes the common cold. When this modified adenovirus is injected into humans, the hope is that it will instruct cells to make coronavirus proteins and will trigger an immune response.Protein: These vaccines are typically made from coronavirus proteins, which can be synthesized or brewed in labs like beer. Some versions involve coating a carrier—such as nanoparticles—with proteins to better aid delivery and uptake by cells.Three COVID-19 vaccines are available for use in the United States. U.S. regulators have approved Pfizer’s vaccine for adults and authorized it for emergency use in children and adolescents ages five to 17. The U.S. has also granted emergency use authorization to administer the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to adults.Some populations in the country are eligible for booster doses. Anyone who received a Johnson & Johnson single-shot jab can get a second dose after at least two months. People who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are eligible for a third dose after six months if they are over 65 or have an underlying condition that makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19. People whose institutional or occupational settings put them at high risk of exposure to the coronavirus may also get a booster shot. U.S. regulators have permitted people to mix-and-match their jabs in the wake of data suggesting that people who originally received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are protected by a booster dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.U.S. regulators have also recommended a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people with compromised immune systems. This extra dose is considered part of their primary vaccination series; CDC guidance suggests that immunocompromised people will be able to get a fourth booster dose six months after completing the primary series.The World Health Organization is coordinating global efforts to administer vaccines, with an eye toward delivering two billion doses by the end of 2021. It is leading an initiative through the COVAX Facility to ensure that all countries have equitable access. The WHO has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Bharat Biotech vaccines for emergency use.On July 13, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added a warning label to Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine after it was linked to rare cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can lead to paralysis. There have been 100 preliminary reports of the syndrome among the approximately 12.5 million people who have received the vaccine. The FDA said that the benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the risks.The FDA has also added a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults. The move came after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices announced that it has identified more than 300 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis that it acknowledged are likely linked to the vaccines. The agency says these cases are rare but higher than expected. It also said the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.In April, the European Medicines Agency issued statements saying that unusual blood clots should be listed as a very rare but possible side effect of both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. In a review of 86 reported cases related to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the EMA’s safety committee found a potential link between it and the clots, with most known cases occurring in women under age 60 within two weeks of receiving the first dose. The EMA stressed that the odds of developing a clot after vaccination are extremely low, and that the benefits of getting vaccinated outweigh the risks. They also recommend that people seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms related to clotting, including persistent pain, shortness of breath, and headaches or blurred vision.On August 27, a study published in the British Medical Journal affirmed the EMA’s risk-benefit analysis, showing that there’s a much higher risk of developing blood clots after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after immunization with the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines.On August 11, the CDC officially recommended that people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or may become pregnant get a COVID-19 vaccine. A new analysis of data from the vaccine rollout found no increased risk of miscarriage among people who received an mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier studies also showed that the vaccine is safe later in pregnancy as well—for both pregnant people and their babies. The CDC emphasized the urgency of vaccination among these groups in a health alert issued on September 29, reporting new data showing a rise in COVID-19-related deaths among pregnant people.Here are some of the vaccines that have made it to phase three and beyond:Name: BNT162b2Who: One of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, based in New York, in collaboration with German biotech company BioNTech.What: A nucleic-acid vaccine that requires two doses taken 21 days apart.Approval status: On December 2, the U.K. became the first Western country to approve any COVID-19 vaccine when it authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech candidate—making the drug the first mRNA vaccine in history allowed for human use. The FDA granted emergency use authorization to this vaccine on December 11, 2020, and fully approved it on August 23, 2021. The vaccine has also been granted emergency approval in Canada, the European Union, and other countries.U.S. regulators have also approved Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use in children and adolescents ages five to 15. U.K. regulators have also approved this vaccine for use among adolescents ages 12 to 15, while the European Union granted conditional authorization.As of September 24 U.S. regulators granted emergency use authorization of a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine—but only for certain subgroups of the national population, including older people and those with underlying conditions that put them at higher risk of disease and for people in occupational or institutional settings that put them at high risk of infection, such as health-care workers and teachers.Distribution: Globally, Pfizer expects to be able to produce up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Questions have been raised over the vaccine’s storage, which requires ultra-cold freezers set at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees F). On February 19, however, Pfizer and BioNTech said that their vaccine can remain stable for two weeks at temperatures between minus 25℃ and minus 15℃ (-13℉ to 5℉), a common range in pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators. The finding would allow for easier distribution of the vaccine in communities where ultra-cold storage requirements present a challenge.Efficacy: On September 20, Pfizer announced that a study of its clinical trials shows its vaccine is safe and highly effective in children ages five to 11. Researchers determined that two low doses administered three weeks apart elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies among children, with side effects comparable to those seen in people ages 16 to 25. The 10-milligram doses of vaccine are a third of what has been approved among older age groups. The company later released an analysis of its clinical trials showing that the vaccine is 90.7 percent effective in preventing symptomatic disease among kids in this age group.Pfizer also expects to release data soon on how well its vaccine works among children ages six months to five years, according to CEO Albert Bourla. In a public forum, he said the data could be available as early as the end of October.On August 25, Pfizer announced new data showing that a third dose of its vaccine generates robust quantity of neutralizing antibodies that is more than three times higher than what was observed one month after the second dose.A preprint study out of the United Kingdom shows that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines remain protective against the Delta variant but that their efficacy wanes over time. Among study participants, Pfizer’s vaccine waned more rapidly. Within four to five months after a second dose, the vaccine’s efficacy was on par with the AstraZeneca shot. The study emphasizes, however, the both vaccines still significantly reduce the risk of infection.On July 8, a study published in Nature demonstrated that people who have received both doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines remain fully protected against severe disease, hospitalization, and death from the Delta and Beta variants. However, a single dose of either vaccine was not as protective.The findings corroborate an earlier study published in Nature showing that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines elicit “robust and prolonged” immune responses. As the New York Times reported at the time, the findings suggested that people who are immunized with these vaccines may not need booster shots as protection may last for years so long as the virus doesn’t mutate to evade it.On June 10, a study published in the journal Nature showed that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine protects against several virus variants, including the Delta and Eta variants. The news came a few days after the CDC announced that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines reduce the risk of infection by 91 percent for fully vaccinated people.In April, the CDC released a study of the U.S. vaccine rollout showing that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in real-world conditions. The study analyzed the efficacy of the two mRNA vaccines among nearly 4,000 health-care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers who were the first to receive the jab in the U.S. It also showed the vaccines are 80-percent effective after one dose. The findings confirmed earlier studies from the U.K. and Israel.On December 10, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of Pfizer’s phase three study, showing the vaccine was safe and 95-percent effective in protecting against COVID-19 in people 16 and older. Pfizer and BioNTech have also announced that a phase three trial shows that their vaccine is safe and 100 percent efficacious among children between the ages of 12 and 15, and that it elicited robust antibody responses.Safety: On June 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it plans to add a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults. The news comes after the CDC convened an emergency meeting of its advisory committee to discuss “rare but higher-than-expected” cases of myocarditis and pericarditis among young people who have received the vaccines. The committee acknowledged that these cases are likely linked to the vaccines but that the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.Severe allergic reactions following immunization with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been reported in many countries. White House advisor Anthony Fauci told CNBC in December that some adverse reactions are expected when a vaccine is distributed to a wider population. Regulators in the U.S. and U.K. have also released reports offering reassurances that severe reactions are rare.Clinical trials status: On November 18, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the conclusion of their phase three trials. The trials launched in July, enrolling a diverse population in areas with significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Pfizer later expanded the trial to include 44,000 people across multiple countries.On February 18, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the launch of a phase two/three clinical trial to study the vaccine’s safety and efficacy among 4,000 pregnant women over the age of 18. The companies also launched a phase 1/2/3 study in children between the ages of six months and 11 years.On June 8, Pfizer said that it would expand its clinical trials to a larger group of children under age 12. After a phase one study showed that the vaccine was safe and effective in a group of 144 children, the clinical trials enrolled up to 4,500 children at more than 90 sites in the U.S., Finland, Poland, and Spain. Pfizer tested a dose of 10 micrograms in children ages 5 to 11, and three micrograms for children from six months to five years old.On July 8, Pfizer and Biotech announced that they are developing an updated version of the vaccine that specifically targets the Delta variant.Name: JNJ-78436735Who: One of the world’s largest multinational corporations, based in New Jersey, specializing in healthcare and pharmaceutical products.What: A single-dose vector vaccine. (Here’s how the Johnson & Johnson vaccine works.)Approval status: Approved for use in the U.S., Bahrain, Canada, and the European Union.On October 21 the CDC cleared the way for the U.S. to begin rolling out booster shots of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine for all people ages 18 and older at least two months after a first dose.U.S. regulators also authorized mixing and matching vaccines—such as administering booster doses of the either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine to people who originally received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. A preprint analysis of a National Institutes of Health study shows that a booster dose of the mRNA vaccines elicit a stronger immune response than another dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot.Distribution: On March 2, the U.S. announced that Johnson & Johnson has partnered with its competitor Merck to increase the supply of its COVID-19 vaccine. Merck will dedicate two facilities to producing the vaccine, which could double the amount of available doses. Biden said that the additional doses will allow the U.S. to vaccinate all adults by the end of May.On June 11, the New York Times reported that the FDA has told Johnson & Johnson to throw out 60 million doses made at its plant in Baltimore. The news came a day after CNN reported that the U.S. hasn’t sent any shipments of the vaccine since the first week of May due to a lack of supply caused by earlier issues at the plant. On June 10, Johnson & Johnson also announced that the FDA has approved an extension of the shelf life of its vaccine from three to four and a half months.Efficacy: In September 2021 Johnson & Johnson announced results of its studies of booster doses. When administered two months after the first jab, the booster is 100 percent effective against severe disease and causes antibody levels to rise four to six times higher than after the first shot. The second dose was also shown to be 75 percent effective against all symptomatic disease globally and 94 percent effective in the U.S. The company said that a booster shot administered six months after the first dose produced a 12-fold increase in antibody levels.The company also said that real-world evidence shows that its single-dose vaccine remains effective against COVID-19. The press release cited a study published to a preprint server, which shows that the vaccine remains 79 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 and 81 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations. An earlier study conducted by Johnson & Johnson shows that its vaccine offers strong protection against Delta that lasts for at least eight months.However, on July 20, the New York Times reported on a preliminary study showing that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is less effective against the Delta and Lambda variants than it was against the original virus strain. The paper notes that the results were obtained in a lab experiment and may not reflect the vaccine’s real-world efficacy.On February 24, an FDA analysis confirmed Johnson & Johnson’s earlier report that its vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. The report found the vaccine is 72-percent effective in preventing COVID-19 based on U.S. trials, and 85-percent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions. It also shows that the vaccine was 64-percent effective in preventing disease in the company’s South African trials, which is higher than had previously been reported.On June 9, a study published in the journal Nature showed that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is effective in protecting against virus variants, including the Beta and Gamma variants of concern. The study showed that the vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies and a T-cell response among people who live in areas where the variants are widely circulating, including Brazil and South Africa.Safety: On July 13, U.S. regulators added a warning to Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine in response to rare reports linking the shot to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves. The FDA said there have been about a hundred preliminary reports of the syndrome among the 12.8 million people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It added that the benefits of receiving the vaccine still outweigh the risks.CDC officials told the Washington Post that the cases have mostly been reported about two weeks after vaccination among men, many aged 50 or older, and that these cases will be discussed during an upcoming meeting of the CDC’s advisory committee.In the spring, the vaccine’s rollout was briefly halted in the U.S. and across Europe as regulators investigated reports of blood clotting among people who have received the shot. The FDA and CDC reviewed 15 cases of blood clots. The cases—which the agencies noted are “extremely rare”—occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 48 within six to 13 days after vaccination. The Europeans Medicines Agency also said that the cases it reviewed occurred in people under 60—mostly women—within three weeks of vaccination.On April 23, the U.S. FDA and CDC lifted the pause on Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine and said that immunizations can resume immediately. The agencies said that the risk of blood clots is “very low” and that the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh the risks. It will add information about the increased risk of blood clots to the vaccine’s label. The decision came days after the European Medicines Agency said that blood clots should be listed as a “very rare” side effect of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine.Clinical trials status: On September 23, 2020, Johnson & Johnson announced the launch of its phase three “ENSEMBLE” trial to evaluate the safety of the vaccine—and how well it works—among up to 60,000 adults from a variety of countries. The trial included “significant representation” from older populations and those with underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to COVID-19.On October 12, 2020, Johnson & Johnson announced that it paused phase three trials for an independent safety review due to an unexplained illness in a participant. The company didn’t provide any details, in part to protect the patient’s privacy, but said that illnesses and accidents are expected in large clinical studies. What’s more, study pauses are routine for clinical trials and aren’t typically reported. Later that month, the company announced it would resume trials, which were fully enrolled with 45,000 participants by December 17.On November 15, 2020, Johnson & Johnson launched a second phase three trial to study the safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of its vaccine candidate in up to 30,000 volunteers worldwide. The study intends to assess whether a second dose of the vaccine will offer longer-lasting protection.On April 2, Johnson & Johnson announced that it has begun vaccinating children age 12 to 17 as part of its phase 2a clinical trial. The company said it will initially test the vaccine in adolescents age 16 to 17 before expanding it to younger children.Name: mRNA-1273Who: A Massachusetts-based biotech company, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health.What: A nucleic-acid vaccine that requires two doses.Approval status: On December 18, the FDA granted emergency approval to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the second available in the United States. The vaccine has also been approved in the European Union, Canada, the U.K., Israel, and by the WHO.On October 21 the CDC cleared the way for some people to get booster shots of the Moderna vaccine. The agency endorsed the FDA’s emergency use authorization of booster doses for all people ages 65 and older, as well as those ages 18 to 64 who are at risk of severe COVID-19 because of their underlying conditions. It also includes people ages 18 to 64 who are at high risk of exposure because of where they work or live, such as health-care workers or incarcerated people.Moderna has applied for full FDA approval of its COVID-19 vaccine for use in people age 18 and older. The company also plans to file for emergency use authorization for teens ages 12 to 17.On October 5, Moderna announced that European Union regulators have authorized a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine for “severely immunocompromised” people ages 12 and older.Distribution: The FDA has said that Moderna’s vaccine can now be kept at room temperature for up to a day. The vaccine can otherwise be safely stored on ice or in a normal refrigerator for 30 days. These changes are expected to help the company distribute its vaccine more quickly.The company plans to deliver at least 500 million doses globally per year beginning in 2021, thanks in part to a deal it has struck with Swiss manufacturer Lonza that will allow it to manufacture up to a billion doses a year.Efficacy: A study of clinical trials among adolescents ages 12 to 17 shows that its vaccine is safe and 100 percent effective. The study also showed the vaccine is 93 percent effective among participants in this age group two weeks after the first dose.Moderna has said that the phase two clinical trials of its booster dose showed that a third dose administered six months after the second “induce robust antibody responses” and increased protections against the variants of concern. It has also said that a study of the phase two clinical trials of its three booster candidates produced robust antibody responses against the virus, including the Gamma, Beta, and Delta variants of concern.However, there is some doubt about whether people who received the Moderna shot will need boosters. A study published in the journal Nature in June 2021 showed that the vaccine elicits “robust and prolonged” immune responses—indicating that protection may last for years so long as the virus doesn’t mutate to evade it.On September 10, the CDC released a study of more than 32,000 real-world cases suggesting that Moderna’s vaccine is more effective at preventing hospitalizations than the Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The overall efficacy of Moderna’s vaccine was 95 percent, compared to 80 percent for Pfizer and 60 percent for Johnson & Johnson.The study backed up earlier studies suggesting that Moderna’s vaccine may provide stronger protection than Pfizer’s jab. A study published on August 30 found that Moderna’s vaccine produces significantly more neutralizing antibodies than Pfizer’s, which might be attributed to the higher dosage or the longer interval between the first and second doses. On August 8, a preliminary Mayo Clinic study of more than 50,000 patients showed that the efficacy of Moderna’s vaccine dropped from 86 percent in early 2021 to 76 percent in July, when the Delta variant was predominant. Meanwhile, the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy dropped over the same time period from 76 percent to 42 percent.An earlier preprint analysis of Moderna’s vaccine also suggested that antibody levels can predict the vaccine’s efficacy against COVID-19. The study showed that people with breakthrough infections who had lower levels of antibodies in their blood were more likely to develop symptomatic infections than those with higher levels of antibodies. The study authors tell Nature that the data doesn’t suggest a threshold of antibodies that ensures protection but it does show a relationship between higher levels of antibodies and lower risk of infection.On August 12, a study published in the journal Science showed that Moderna’s vaccine protects against COVID-19 for at least six months and is effective against the Delta variant. The findings confirm earlier studies and announcements made by the company that its vaccine remains 93 percent effective for at least six months after administration of the second dose.On July 9, Nature reported on a study showing that two quarter-doses of Moderna’s vaccine generates long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and T cells. The results suggest that it might be possible to administer fractional doses to help stretch the world’s vaccine supply, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that are facing shortages.On February 17, the New England Journal of Medicine published a preliminary report showing that Moderna’s vaccine remains effective in protecting against the virus variant found in the U.K. However, it may be less effective in protecting against the South African variant—although researchers noted that further study is needed.In December 2020, an FDA analysis of the phase three study of Moderna’s vaccine confirmed that it is 94.1-percent effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100-percent effective at preventing severe cases after taking two doses.Safety: On June 23, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it planned to add a warning label to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines about rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults. The news comes after the CDC convened an emergency meeting of its advisory committee to discuss “rare but higher-than-expected” cases of myocarditis and pericarditis among young people who have received the vaccines. The committee acknowledged that these cases are likely linked to the vaccines but that the benefits of the shots outweigh the risks.Clinical trials status: Moderna announced on December 17, 2020, that it was launching clinical trials to evaluate the vaccine’s safety in children and people with cancer; it will also establish a “pregnancy registry” to track the vaccine’s safety in people who are pregnant.The company started the third phase of its clinical trials in July 2020. Preliminary findings from its phase one trials showed that healthy subjects—including elderly patients—produced coronavirus antibodies and a reaction from T cells, another part of the human immune response. Phase three tested the vaccine in 30,000 U.S. participants.On February 24, Moderna announced that it has shipped doses of a booster vaccine to the U.S. National Institutes of Health for clinical trials. The phase one trial will determine whether the booster can improve immunity against the South Africa variant. Moderna is also investigating using a third dose of its approved vaccine to protect against variants.Name: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19Who: The U.K. university, in collaboration with the biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.What: A viral vector vaccine that requires two doses.Approval status: Approved for use in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Argentina, India, and other countries. It has also been authorized by the World Health Organization.Efficacy: In August 2021 a preprint study out of the United Kingdom showed that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines remain protective against the Delta variant but that their efficacy wanes over time. Among study participants, Pfizer’s vaccine waned more rapidly. Within four to five months after a second dose, the vaccine’s efficacy was on par with the AstraZeneca shot. The study emphasizes, however, both vaccines still significantly reduce the risk of infection.On July 8, a study published in Nature demonstrated that people who have received both doses of the AstraZeneca of Pfizer vaccines remain fully protected from the Delta and Beta variants. However, a single dose of either vaccine was not as protective.On June 25, preliminary results from a British study showed that mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provides strong protection against COVID-19. Researchers told the New York Times that the protection is strong regardless of the order in which the vaccines are administered. The findings will be useful for those who are unable to get a second AstraZeneca vaccine due to production delays and safety concerns, although researchers say it’s still best to get two doses of the same vaccine for now.On March 24, AstraZeneca released the primary analysis of its U.S. phase three clinical trials showing that its vaccine is 76 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, slightly lower than the 79 percent efficacy it had announced two days earlier based on a partial analysis of the data. It is also 85 percent effective in people 65 and older and 100 percent effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.U.S. health officials had taken the unusual step of questioning the decision to release the interim results, describing them as “outdated and potentially misleading.” In a letter obtained by the Washington Post, an independent panel of experts at the National Institutes of Health that oversees U.S. clinical trials said that it had recommended the company release a later analysis instead, showing the vaccine may be 69 to 74 percent effective.The companies also said that the vaccine’s efficacy increased to 82 percent when the second dose was taken after 12 weeks or longer, rather than the originally recommended four-week interval. The British government has recommended the longer gap in its rollout of the vaccine to prioritize getting the first shot to as many at-risk people as possible.On February 7, South Africa halted its use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine after preliminary laboratory studies showed it offered only minimal protection against the virus variant that is dominant in that country. The finding was later confirmed by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that the vaccine does not protect against mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 caused by the South African variant. Early data suggested that the vaccine will still effectively protect against the variant that is prevalent throughout the U.K.Safety: On June 9, a study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine have a slightly increased risk of a bleeding disorder. The analysis of 2.53 million people who received the vaccine found an incidence of 1.13 cases per 100,000 vaccines. Researchers said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh the risks. The study echoed an earlier safety review conducted by the European Medicines Agency.In Canada, meanwhile, on June 29 regulatory officials advised people with a history of capillary leak syndrome against receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. Health Canada is also updating the vaccine’s label to add the syndrome as a potential side effect.Distribution: Project members say their candidate can be stored at temperatures seen in common refrigeration. Oxford and AstraZeneca expect to produce up to three billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.On December 30, the U.K. announced changes to its vaccine delivery plan to prioritize delivering the first dose of either vaccine to as many at-risk people as possible, based on data provided to and released by health regulators. It did so by delaying administration of the second dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford drug. A similar rule was issued for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but regulators didn’t provide data to back the new regimen. Overall, the U.K. still recommends that recipients receive two doses of either vaccine for maximum benefit.Clinical trials status: On December 11, AstraZeneca and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute announced plans to work together to study the possibility of combining Oxford’s vaccine with Gamaleya’s Sputnik V vaccine. Since both use the same adenovirus, researchers will investigate whether a combination of the two will improve efficacy.The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine’s phase three trial aimed to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers in Brazil, the U.K., the United States, and South Africa. On September 8, AstraZeneca paused the trials for a safety review due to an adverse reaction in one participant in the U.K., which the company described as a “routine action.” After an investigation by independent regulators, the trials resumed in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, and India in September and resumed in the U.S. a month later.Name: NVX-CoV2373Who: A biotechnology company based in Gaithersburg, Maryland.What: A protein vaccine that involves a nanoparticle carrier to better aid delivery and uptake by cells. The vaccine is administered in two doses, 21 days apart.Approval status: Authorized for emergency use in Indonesia.Novavax has not yet submitted its vaccine to the FDA for emergency use authorization, but it is planning to do so. Reuters reports that Novavax also said that it will file a separate application for booster shots once the emergency use authorization submission is processed; the company said its booster shot given six months after the two-dose regimen elicited a 4.6-fold increase in antibodies. The company has filed for authorization from regulators in India and the Philippines.Efficacy and safety: On June 14, Novavax announced that its vaccine is safe and 90.4 percent effective in protecting against COVID-19—including the more contagious virus variants that are circulating. The vaccine is also 100 percent effective at preventing moderate and severe disease among 29,960 clinical trial participants age 18 and older in the U.S. and Mexico.On March 11, Novavax announced that a final analysis of its phase three clinical trials in the U.K. shows that its vaccine is 96.4-percent effective in preventing COVID-19. It also announced the findings of its phase 2b clinical trial in South Africa, which showed the vaccine was only 48.6-percent effective against the strains circulating there. Both trials showed the vaccine is 100-percent effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.On January 28, 2021, Novavax had announced preliminary results of its phase three trials in the U.K., which showed at the time that its vaccine is 89.3-percent effective in preventing COVID-19. On September 2, 2020, a study of the company’s phase one trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the vaccine was safe and produced coronavirus antibodies at a higher level than is seen among those who have recovered from COVID-19. It also stimulated T cells, another arm of the human immune response.Clinical trials status: On September 24, 2020, Novavax announced the launch of its phase three trial in the United Kingdom, which evaluated the vaccine in up to 10,000 people, both with and without underlying conditions. Up to 400 participants were also vaccinated against the seasonal flu as part of a sub-study to help determine whether it is safe to give patients both vaccines at the same time. On November 30, Novavax said it had completed enrollment in its phase three trial in the U.K.On December 28, 2020, Novavax announced the launch of a phase three study in the U.S. and Mexico, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of its vaccine in up to 30,000 adults.Name: NoneWho: China’s state-run pharmaceutical company, in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.What: Two inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Approval status: China has approved one of the company’s vaccines for general use and another for limited use. One of the Sinopharm vaccines has also been approved by the World Health Organization as well as in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and other countries.Sinopharm filed for final regulatory approval from China in late November, two months after the New Yorker reported that hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians have already been vaccinated under the government’s emergency-use approval. China began to innoculate medical workers and other high-risk groups with the Sinopharm trial vaccines in July, making it the first experimental vaccine available to civilians beyond clinical volunteers.Efficacy and safety: On July 19 preliminary results from a study conducted in Sri Lanka found that Sinopharm’s vaccine was less effective against the Delta variant than the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. As Reuters reported, the study showed that the vaccine elicited a 1.38-fold reduction in antibody levels against the variant.On May 7, the World Health Organization estimated the Sinopharm vaccine’s efficacy to be 79 percent among all age groups, affirming the company’s earlier announcement of the results of its phase three study.Preliminary findings from two randomized trials, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, have shown the vaccine can trigger an antibody response with no serious adverse effects. The study did not measure T cell-mediated immune responses. These results are significant, though, as they are the first published data from human clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine that uses a whole, inactivated virus.Clinical trials status: Sinopharm launched its first phase three trial in July 2020 among 15,000 volunteers—aged 18 to 60, with no serious underlying conditions—in the UAE. The company selected the UAE because it has a diverse population made up of approximately 200 nationalities, making it an ideal testing ground. Sinopharm also conducted phase three trials in locations such as Peru and Bahrain.Name: CoronaVacWho: A Chinese biopharmaceutical company, in collaboration with Brazilian research center Butantan.What: An inactivated vaccine.Approval status: Approved for limited use by the WHO as well as in China, Indonesia, Brazil, and other countries.Efficacy and safety: On July 15 Reuters reported that the leaders of a Chilean study have recommended administering a third dose of Sinovac’s vaccine as its efficacy has waned in the face of the Delta variant. The vaccine’s level of protection is lower than others—late-stage trials found that it is 51 percent effective in preventing COVID-19. Still, Nature reports that it is 100 percent effective at preventing severe disease and therefore is key to helping curb the pandemic.On April 7, a preliminary study of CoronaVac’s vaccine rollout in Brazil showed that the vaccine is about 50 percent effective in protecting against COVID-19 in a region where the highly transmissible P.1 variant is circulating.Clinical trials status: CoronaVac entered phase three trials in July, with plans to recruit nearly 9,000 healthcare professionals in Brazil, in addition to phase three trials in Indonesia. A planned trial in Bangladesh was delayed, after Bangladesh refused in October to co-finance a late-stage trial.Name: AbdalaWho: A government-run research institute in Cuba.What: A protein subunit vaccine that’s administered in three doses.Approval status: Approved for emergency use in Cuba and Vietnam. Prior to granting emergency use authorization, Cuba had already begun administering the vaccine among health workers as part of an “intervention study.”Efficacy and safety: On June 22 Cuba announced that the Abdala vaccine is 92.28 percent effective against COVID-19.Clinical trials: In March Cuba launched phase three clinical trials for the Abdala vaccine among 48,000 volunteers.Name: Soberana-02Who: A government-run research institute in Cuba.What: A conjugate vaccine that uses part of the virus spike protein.Approval status: Authorized for emergency use in Cuba and Iran.Efficacy: On June 22 the New York Times reported that the Soberana-02 vaccine was 62 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 after two of its three required doses.Clinical trials: On March 4, Cuba became the first country in Latin America to announce the launch of a phase three clinical trial for one of its COVID-19 vaccines, the Miami Herald reported. The Cuban government said the phase three trial would be conducted in Havana among 44,000 volunteers.Name: CVnCoVWho: A German biopharmaceutical company in partnership with Bayer, a German multinational pharmaceutical company.What: An mRNA vaccine that’s administered in two doses taken 28 days apart.Approval status: Not approved for use. On October 12, 2021, CureVac announced that it was withdrawing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate months after it reported disappointing results from a study of its clinical trials showing its vaccine was only 47 percent effective in preventing COVID-19, falling short of the company’s own criteria for success. CureVac attributed its results to the virus variants that were circulating at the time. It sequenced 124 cases of COVID-19 among clinical trial participants and found only one case was caused by the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and more than half were caused by variants of concern.Efficacy and safety: On January 11, CureVac announced that preliminary results show its vaccine prompted robust antibody and T-cell responses in rhesus macaques.Clinical trials status: On December 14, 2020, CureVac announced it had begun enrolling participants in a phase 2b/3 study to assess its vaccine’s safety and efficacy in more than 35,000 participants in Europe and Latin America. One week later, the company launched a separate phase three trial in healthcare workers in Mainz, Germany.Name: NoneWho: A global biopharmaceutical company in partnership with a global healthcare company.What: An adjuvant-supported recombinant-protein vaccine.Approval status: Not approved for use.Efficacy and safety: On May 17, the companies announced that a study of their phase two clinical trials shows the vaccine generated a high level of neutralizing antibodies with no safety concerns.Clinical trials: On May 27, 2021, Sanofi and GSK announced that they had started to enroll participants in a phase three clinical study to test the safety and efficacy of their vaccine in 35,000 volunteers ages 18 and older in the U.S., Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The study’s broad geographic range was intended to allow the companies to evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy against variants of concern.Name: NoneWho: An Indian vaccine and pharmaceutical company in partnership with the Baylor College of Medicine.What: A protein-based subunit vaccine that requires two doses administered 28 days apart.Latest news: On April 26, the companies announced that they received approval to launch a phase three clinical trial of their vaccine candidate. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the vaccine among more than 1,200 volunteers ages 18 to 80 at 15 sites across India.Approval status: Not approved for use.Distribution: If the vaccine is approved for use, it will be distributed through the COVAX Facility, a global effort to ensure the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.Name: VLA2001Who: A vaccine developer based in France.What: An inactivated virus, adjuvant-supported vaccine, with two doses administered three weeks apart.Approval status: Not approved for use. The company has initiatied rolling submission for approval with U.K. and European regulators.Safety and efficacy: On October 18 Valneva announced that its vaccine elicited higher antibody levels than the AstraZeneca vaccine and “significantly fewer” adverse events among participants age 30 and older.On April 6, Valneva announced that a study of its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials show that its vaccine prompted a strong immune response with no safety concerns.Clinical trials: On April 21 Valneva announced the launch of phase three clinical trials to study the safety and efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine compared to that of AstraZeneca’s conditionally approved vaccine. Approximately 4,000 volunteers were expected to receive two doses of either vaccine to determine the immune response of each. Valneva says it hopes to file for regulatory approval in the fall of 2021.Name: None.Who: A China-based pharmaceuticals companyWhat: An inactivated vaccine that requires two doses administered 28 days apart.Approval status: Authorized for emergency use in China. The country approved the Kangtai shot for emergency use in May 2021, just weeks after the vaccine launched its phase three clinical trials.Clinical trials: Kangtai’s phase three clinical trials are underway, testing the vaccine’s safety and efficacy among 28,000 adults age 18 and older.Name: CoVLPWho: A Canadian biotechnology company, in partnership with British multinational pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.What: A plant-derived recombinant vaccine with an adjuvant that requires two doses administered 21 days apart.Efficacy and safety: In May 2021 Medicago reported that interim data from its phase two clinical trial showed that its COVID-19 vaccine elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies with no severe adverse reactions.Clinical trials: On March 16, Medicago and GlaxoSmithKline announced that their vaccine had entered phase three clinical trials to study its safety and efficacy in up to 30,000 volunteers in 10 countries, including Canada and the U.S.Name: COVAXINWho: An Indian biotechnology company, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology.What: An inactivated vaccine, which requires two doses that are administered 28 days apart.Approval status: Authorized for emergency use in India, Mexico, the Philippines, and other countries. The WHO has also listed the vaccine for emergency use.Efficacy and safety: In November 2021 the WHO said that its analysis of COVAXIN shows the vaccine is 78 percent effective against COVID-19 and “is extremely suitable for low-and-middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements.”On March 3 Bharat Biotech announced that an interim analysis of its phase three trial showed its vaccine is 81-percent effective in protecting against COVID-19 after the second dose. A separate preliminary study also indicated that the vaccine produces antibodies that can neutralize the virus variant that originated in the U.K.On January 21, The Lancet published interim findings from COVAXIN’s phase one study that showed the vaccine elicited an immune response in participants. The study identified only one serious adverse event, and it was unrelated to the vaccine.Clinical trials status: On November 16, Bharat Biotech announced it had begun phase three trials involving 26,000 participants at more than 25 centers across India.Name: Sputnik VWho: A Russian research institution, in partnership with the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund.What: A viral vector vaccine that uses two strains of adenovirus and requires a second injection after 21 days to boost the immune response.Approval status: In August, Russia cleared the Sputnik V vaccine for widespread use and claimed it as the first registered COVID-19 vaccine on the market—before the vaccine’s phase three trials had begun and despite the lack of published evidence at the time. It has since been approved in Belarus, Argentina, Venezuela, and other countries.On March 4 the European Union announced that it would begin a rolling review of the Sputnik V vaccine. The announcement came after a handful of European countries said they would consider approving the vaccine without E.U. approval. Hungary has already authorized the vaccine. But on October 21 Reuters reported that European regulators are unlikely to make a final decision until early 2022.Efficacy and safety: On February 2, the medical journal The Lancet published the results of a phase three trial in Moscow that found the Sputnik V vaccine is safe and 91.6-percent effective in preventing COVID-19. The study, which involved more than 22,000 participants, also showed the vaccine is 100-percent effective in preventing moderate or severe cases of the disease, as no such cases were confirmed at least 21 days after receiving the first dose.Distribution: Global demand for Sputnik V soared in the weeks after the vaccine’s efficacy data was published. The vaccine makers reached deals with more than 40 countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa. On February 19, the African Union announced that Russia has offered them 300 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine.Clinical trials status: On December 11, the Gamaleya Institute and biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca announced they will work together to study the possibility of combining Sputnik V with the candidate that AstraZeneca has developed with the University of Oxford. Since both candidates use the same adenovirus, researchers will investigate whether combining them will improve efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is 70.4-percent effective in preventing COVID-19.Name: CoviVacWho: A Russian research center.What: An inactivated vaccine given in two doses, 14 days apart.Approval status: On February 20, Russia approved the CoviVac vaccine for use even though late-stage clinical trials to test its safety and efficacy have not yet begun. Reuters reports that early-stage trials with 200 participants showed the vaccine has no side effects.Distribution: The Chumakov Center plans to produce half a million doses per month.Name: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trialWho: The largest child health research institute in Australia, in collaboration with the University of Melbourne.What: For nearly a hundred years, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been used to prevent tuberculosis by exposing patients to a small dose of live bacteria. Evidence has emerged over the years that this vaccine may boost the immune system and help the body fight off other diseases as well.Efficacy and safety: On November 10, 2020, a U.S. study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that among 6,201 healthcare workers in Los Angeles, those who had previously received the BCG vaccine reported symptoms of COVID-19 less often than those who hadn’t, a finding that study authors say strengthens the case for further research. In October of that year, the U.K. launched a study of the BCG vaccine that is part of the Australian-led trials. The study is seeking to recruit a thousand frontline health-care workers to test the vaccine’s effectiveness against COVID-19.Clinical trials status: In Apri 2020, researchers from the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute began a series of randomized controlled trials that will test whether BCG might work on the coronavirus as well. They aim to recruit 10,000 healthcare workers in the study. In an April 2020 scientific brief, the World Health Organization found that there is no current evidence that the BCG vaccine protects people against infection with the coronavirus.Approval status: Not approved for use.Name: Ad5-nCoVWho: A Chinese biopharmaceutical company.What: A viral vector vaccine.Approval status: On June 25, 2020, CanSino became the first company to receive limited approval to use its vaccine in people even though it was still in the second phase of its clinical trials. At the time, the Chinese government pproved the vaccine for military use only, for a period of one year. Since then, the vaccine has been approved in China, Argentina, Hungary, and other countries.Efficacy and safety: Preliminary results from phase two trials, published in The Lancet, have shown that the vaccine produces “significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.” There were no serious adverse reactions documented.Clinical trials status: On December 21, CanSino announced that it has recruited more than 20,000 participants for its phase three trials in Pakistan, Russia, Mexico, and Chile. On August 15, Russian biopharmaceutical company Petrovax announced it had launched the first phase three clinical trial of Ad5-nCoV.Name: EpiVacCoronaWho: A Russian biotechnology institute.What: A protein vaccine, namely it uses small fragments of viral antigens called peptides to produce an immune response.Approval status: On October 14, 2020, Russia granted regulatory approval to EpiVacCorona even though the vaccine candidate had not published any results and had not entered phase three of its clinical trials. It is the second vaccine candidate that Russia approved for use despite a lack of published evidence about its safety and efficacy. It has since been approved for use in Turkmenistan and authorized for emergency use in Belarus.Efficacy and safety: On January 13, 2021, Russian state news agency TASS reported that of the more than 2,000 volunteers who had received both doses of EpiVacCorona’s two-dose regimen, none reported adverse reactions from the vaccine.Clinical trials: In November 2020 Russia launched mass trials of its EpiVacCorona vaccine; the trials will inoculate 150 people over the age of 60 and 3,000 volunteers over the age of 18.Name: ZyCoV-DWho: An Indian pharmaceutical company.What: A DNA-based vaccine that is delivered by a skin patch.Approval status: Approved for emergency use in India.Safety and efficacy: In December 2020 Zydus Cadila said that a combined phase one/two study of its vaccine showed it was safe and prompted an immunogenic response, but the company did not share any data.Clinical trials: On January 3, 2021, Zydus Cadila announced it had received approval from Indian regulators to launch a phase three trial testing the safety and efficacy of its vaccine in about 30,000 volunteers.Name: ZF2001Who: A Chinese biopharmaceutical company, in partnership with the Institute of Microbiology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.What: A subunit vaccine that uses pieces of protein from a pathogen to trigger an immune response.Approval status: Approved for use in China, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan.Efficacy and safety: In August 2021 a study of the company’s phase one and two clinical trials published in The Lancet showed that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibodies and that the most common adverse reactions were cough, fever, and headache.Clinical trials: In November 2020 Chinese health officials announced the launch of phase three trials for the Anhui Zhifei vaccine. The trials—which aimed to recruit 29,000 volunteers aged 18 or older—were expected to be conducted in China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ecuador.Name: QazCovid-inWho: A research institute in Kazakhstan.What: An inactivated vaccine.Approval status: Granted temporary registration in Kazakhstan in January 2021 despite a lack of data from its phase three clinical trials.Efficacy and safety: In August 2021 a study of the vaccines phase one and phase two clinical trials published in The Lancet found that the vaccine was safe with no severe adverse events recorded. The studies also found the vaccine elicited a neutralizing antibody response as well as a T-cell response.Clinical trials status: In December 2020, the institute announced that the Kazakh Ministry of Health approved the launch of phase three trials to assess the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in 3,000 volunteers.Name: UnknownWho: A Chinese research institute.What: An inactivated vaccine that requires two doses taken 14 days apart.Approval status: Not approved for use.Clinical trials: In December 2020, researchers launched phase three clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of the vaccine in 34,020 participants in Malaysia and Brazil.Safety and efficacy: Preliminary results of the vaccine’s phase one trial showed that it prompted an immune response with no serious adverse incidents.Editor's note: This story was originally published on July 31, 2020.

"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which allows the virus to break into cells, is a shapeshifter. By making it sit still, scientists uncovered a key to rapidly making coronavirus vaccines. This image is a false-colored, electron-density map acquired via cryogenic electron microscopy.Jason McLellan was wandering around a ski shop of Utah’s Park City Mountain Resort, waiting for his new snowboarding boots to be heat-molded to his size-nine feet, when his smartphone rang. It was Barney Graham, deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Research Center.Two days earlier, the World Health Organization had announced that several unidentified pneumonia-like cases had been reported in Wuhan, China. People were fatigued and feverish, with dry coughs and headaches. These symptoms weren’t unusual for early January, but some people were short of breath, and a few felt like they’d been hit by a train.Graham told McLellan, a structural virologist at the University of Texas at Austin, that the ailment appeared to be a beta-coronavirus, meaning it fell into the genus of viruses that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). He asked McLellan: “Are you ready to get back in the saddle?”This duo was part of a small band of government and university scientists who had spent more than a decade cracking a complex viral puzzle—and their skills were needed once more. Their years of sleuthing and innovating ultimately contributed a microscopic but critical piece to the most promising candidates for COVID-19 vaccines. Two already authorized in the U.S. use their discovery, as do at least two other top contenders.Their solution? Tweaking a shape-shifting protein to make it sit still.By the time McLellan landed in 2008 at the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland as an early-career researcher, Graham had been working on a little known but highly contagious disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus for more than 20 years. Both the cold-causing RSV and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, feature genomes made of RNA. Although the two sit on distant branches of the evolutionary tree, they share a common physical trait that would yield the first key to McLellan and Graham's journey toward beating COVID-19.Attempts to design an RSV vaccine had been riddled with hiccups since 1966 when a clinical trial inadvertently enhanced the illness in volunteers—and even caused the death of two infants. Graham wanted to understand why this drug candidate had failed so terribly.Similar frustrations hovered around another germ under study at the Vaccine Research Center: HIV. McLellan had arrived at the center to train with Peter Kwong, a structural biologist tinkering with the structures of viral proteins in the hopes of engineering a vaccine that would stop AIDS. HIV rapidly mutates, so the researchers tried several structural biology tricks to develop vaccine candidates but ultimately failed to create one that elicited an immune response.“You didn’t know whether it was because the virus was too good or the ideas were bad,” McLellan says.In what the pair now refers to as a happy accident, Graham and McLellan were working near one another on the center’s second floor. Kwong’s fourth-floor lab was too crowded for McLellan, so he set up a workspace within earshot of Graham, and they became friends. “It didn't take long for him to come to me and say, I’d like to work on something other than HIV,” Graham recalls.Past unsuccessful attempts to neutralize RSV with a vaccine had focused on the virus’s class 1 fusion protein, or F protein. In the wild, this protein is a shapeshifter, “like a Transformer toy,” Graham says. It can look one way before the RSV virus infects and enters a cell, and another way after the virus multiplies and escapes. These Jekyll-and-Hyde identities are known as the “prefusion” and “postfusion” states, and all vaccine attempts up until this point had focused on the latter.To make matters trickier, the prefusion form is extremely unstable: It can irreversibly and spontaneously snap to its other state in an instant. Graham and McLellan hypothesized that they might create a more successful RSV vaccine if they could lock in the prefusion state. But no one knew what the prefusion protein looked like; they just knew it was a trickster.So, McLellan used x-ray crystallography—a technique that uses x-ray beams to determine the structure of proteins—to capture an image of the prefusion protein for the first time. Some researchers would later say the prefusion F protein looked like a lollipop. McLellan thought it looked like a Nerf football. “You’re one of the first people in the world to see what this protein looks like,” he says. “It’s pretty cool.”By examining the protein at this atomic level, McLellan found a way to bioengineer it to take away its shape-shifting power. In other words, he stabilized it.When Graham tested this new molecule in animals, it acted as an antigen and stimulated the immune system to fight disease. It had 50 times more neutralizing power against RSV than anything he had tested before. On the flip side, they also showed a postfusion version of the protein takes on an identity that can bypass the immune system’s defenses.Their accomplishment won runner-up recognition in Science’s 2013 Breakthrough of the Year, and their work carved the way for new RSV vaccines that are showing great promise, Graham says.“The work of Jason and Barney and others revolutionized the field,” says Ruth Karron, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the director of the Center for Immunization Research and the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative.Five years ago, a postdoctoral fellow in Graham's laboratory returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia with a respiratory infection. Everyone assumed the fellow had Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by a dangerous coronavirus that had arisen in the country two years earlier.That emergence happened around the same time that McLellan launched his own lab at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. McLellan and Graham had been trying the prefusion trick on MERS, given that coronaviruses feature spike proteins that are also shapeshifters and are used to break into our cells. When Graham's lab tested the postdoc's nasal secretions, they found a related germ—and an opportunity that would pave their final steps toward a COVID-19 vaccine.The postdoc had an older coronavirus: HKU1, a mild cold-causing bug that was discovered in 2005. The Graham-McLellan partnership decided to pivot their focus to HKU1 because MERS required extra safety precautions, and their research on the latter had hit a wall.To capture a 3D picture of HKU1, McLellan would need a different method for taking atomic-level pictures. X-ray crystallography saturates proteins in a salt bath solution until they form crystals akin to rock candy. But due to their physical nature, coronaviruses don’t crystalize well. Cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, is a technique that allows scientists to view proteins frozen in a thin layer of ice, bypassing the need for crystallization.Proteins are so small that you can't use a regular light microscope to take a picture. Scientists used a cryo-electron microscope to determine the SARS-CoV-2 spike's structure. Cryogenic electron microscopy is a technique that allows the researchers to view proteins frozen in a thin layer of ice using beams of electrons. The proteins are lying in a variety of orientations, leaving an assortment of shadows. The scientists then combine all these 2D images of shadows to create a 3D shape.In 2015, structural biologist Andrew Ward was one of the leading cryo-EM experts in the U.S., so McLellan emailed his lab at Scripps Research in San Diego to ask if he had any interest in studying coronaviruses. Coincidentally, Ward had a postdoctoral fellow with a hankering to examine coronaviruses. They ultimately took thousands of images of HKU1 proteins.McLellan used this 3D readout of HKU1 to make educated guesses at how to stabilize the spike proteins from its viral cousins, MERS and SARS. McLellan and Nianshuang Wang, his postdoctoral fellow, discovered that by adding two prolines—rigid amino acids—to MERS’s spike protein, they could prevent it from changing shape.They called the tweak a 2P mutation and filed a patent for it in 2017. Around the same time, Graham’s lab partnered with biotech company Moderna to design an experimental mRNA vaccine for MERS. The two had worked together a year prior on a similar but separate project to combat the Zika virus—as part of a new movement for more comprehensive preparations against global outbreaks. The concept hinged on the detailed study of a prototypical member of a viral family—such as HKU1 or MERS—to build defenses against all future troublemakers from the same family like SARS-CoV-2.Ultimately, experiments in animal models showed the MERS vaccine was successful, says Kizzmekia Corbett, a postdoctoral research fellow in Graham’s laboratory, and created a “portfolio of data” that the scientists knew they could apply to the new coronavirus.On January 6, 2020, just minutes after he took that phone call at the ski shop, McLellan messaged Wang and Daniel Wrapp, a graduate student, on WhatsApp.“Barney is going to try and get the coronavirus sequence out of Wuhan, China,” McLellan wrote to them. “He wants to rush a structure and vaccine. You game?”The two labs worked in concert with one another, determining the virus’s structure in about two weeks and using the 2P mutation to stabilize its proteins. Graham’s lab partnered with Moderna, and Corbett designed and executed clinical assessments to immunize mice with an mRNA vaccine made with the modified proteins starting in February. “When we got the first results from the mice, and they had a great antibody response, it was so gratifying,” Corbett says. By March 4, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had greenlit the Moderna vaccine for human trials.At about the same time, Pfizer and BioNTech spoke with Graham about using the 2P mutation in their vaccine. Because their work was patented and widely published, other drugmakers—including Novavax and Johnson & Johnson—also based their candidates on the design. Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine would become the first authorized in the U.S. after it showed an impressive 95-percent efficacy rate. Moderna’s vaccine was 94-percent effective.(Related: Here’s the latest on COVID-19 vaccines.)Further tests would be needed to judge how much the 2P mutation contributes to the overall efficacies of the frontrunner vaccines. Phil Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer and vice president of viral vaccines, says it’s “absolutely clear” that stabilizing prefusion proteins led to remarkable advances with potential RSV vaccines. “I’m very glad we picked those mutations to move forward,” he says, referring to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.Graham doesn’t quite know how to answer when asked how it feels to have decades’ worth of work contribute to rapidly developed vaccines that could save hundreds of thousands of lives amid a harrowing global pandemic. “That's not the way we usually think about it,” he says. “I don’t think you really think that much about your feelings until you get to certain milestones.”But the question—posed using the phrase “such a time as this”—makes Graham hearken back to the biblical tale of Esther, a queen who was made a royal for “such a time as this.”“I have kind of felt like my whole career has been lining up for ‘such a time as this,’” Graham says.",
"The teenager arrived at the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital in late April with chest pains that had started suddenly. An MRI showed myocarditis: a swelling of the heart muscle. It’s something doctors at the Portland hospital see in young people a handful of times a year, says Judith Guzman-Cottrill, a pediatric infectious disease physician.But the timing caught her attention: Just a few days before his symptoms started, the boy had received his second dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. A couple weeks later, Guzman-Cottrill received a call from a colleague in Atlanta who told her about a similar patient with myocarditis that started two days after his second Pfizer shot. The same day, she got news via email of two more such cases in Connecticut.“Myocarditis in itself is not something so extremely rare that we thought this must be a new illness or new disease,” she says. “But when I heard about what was at that point four new cases—all healthy boys who developed chest pain, I thought, this seems almost too much to be coincidence.”As of June 11, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 323 confirmed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, a related condition, among people ages 12 to 29, mostly documented within a week after each patient had received one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. That figure, announced this week by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, revises the previous count to include data from children ages 12 to 15, a group that gained authorization to get the Pfizer vaccine in May.So far, post-vaccination myocarditis has been most commonly reported among people in their late teens and early 20s, according to the committee’s report. The condition is more likely to occur after the second dose, and it happens more often in boys and young men than in girls and women.Overall, rates of post-vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis are higher than rates normally seen from other causes, Tom Shimabukuro, of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, said during the June 23 committee meeting announcing the results. But cases are still infrequent, and the vast majority of patients have responded quickly to treatment.“This is still a rare event,” Shimabukuro said. “Reassuringly, the available outcome data indicate that patients recover from symptoms and do well.”When young people develop myocarditis or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart), the cause is often a viral infection. Enteroviruses such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease are among the most common triggers, and those infections are most common in the summertime, says Jeremy Asnes, chief of pediatric cardiology at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. There is also evidence of myocarditis after smallpox vaccination.To get a handle on the apparent uptick of myocarditis in teenagers back in April, Guzman-Cottrill and colleagues took a detailed look at the experiences of seven healthy boys, ages 14 to 19, who sought care for chest pain in April or May. For all of them, symptoms began within four days after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Testing confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis. All seven recovered quickly, and three received common pain relievers such as ibuprofen as their only treatment, the team reported in a paper this month.Those findings echoed several other case reports from the U.S. and Israel, which have suggested that post-vaccination myocarditis happens most often in younger people, especially men, says Matthew Oster, a pediatric cardiologist and epidemiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and a member of the CDC's COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, who spoke at the ACIP meeting. Across those reports, cases have generally been mild, and recovery tends to be relatively rapid, with hospital discharge in two to four days instead of six, as is common with more traditional cases.“It seems to disappear more quickly than typical myocarditis,” Oster said at the meeting. “I’m optimistic about that.”The new data are consistent with that previous evidence. Of the 323 confirmed cases so far, 309 were hospitalized, Shimabukuro said. Among those, 295 have been discharged and 218 have recovered from all symptoms. Nine remain hospitalized and two are in the ICU. Most reports of myocarditis came within the first few days after vaccination, especially after the second dose. Cases peak in people in their late teens and early 20s and taper off after age 50.The CDC’s numbers are also in line with what doctors report seeing in their own institutions. At his hospital in New Haven, Asnes says, his team has cared for 10 patients with post-vaccination myocarditis under age 21 and about the same number over 21. Stuart Berger, a pediatric cardiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, says his group has seen six cases of confirmed myocarditis, mostly in boys ages 16 and up. All have been mild and included chest pain that went away quickly.“This has been the experience that that the CDC has described,” says Berger, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academic of Pediatrics. “And it has been the experience that our colleagues and other institutions have described.”Using data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which allows anyone to report any potential issue related to vaccines, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations around the country, the ACIP team calculated a rate of 12.6 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis per million within 21 days after the second dose of any mRNA vaccine in people ages 12 to 39.The CDC continues to investigate reports submitted to VAERS, and Shimabukuro cautioned against focusing too much on the estimated case rate to guide decision-making in clinical settings. But in interviews, experts say the risk appears to be low compared to the number of vaccines administered.As of June 22, more than three million 16- and 17-year-olds had received at least one dose of a vaccine in the U.S., and more than four million 12- to 15-year-olds had begun vaccination. “That denominator is very reassuring to me,” says Guzman-Cottrill, whose 16- and 13-year-olds have been vaccinated, including one with an autoimmune condition.Rates of myocarditis have not been exploding, she adds, even as vaccine numbers grow. “Our emergency rooms are not filled with teenagers with chest pain.”Scientists still don’t know how the vaccine might be causing myocarditis. One leading theory, Oster said, involves a cytokine response—the reaction of inflammatory molecules that rally immune cells to fight. That could explain why the condition appears so quickly after vaccination when it happens. Clinical trials have shown elevated rates of side effects such as fever, muscle aches, chills, and fatigue in young people compared with older adults, and those symptoms are caused by inflammation, Guzman-Cottrill says. So, it would make sense for myocarditis to be another inflammatory response at the most severe end.The mechanism after vaccination is different from what happens in reaction to enteroviruses, Asnes adds. Instead of the direct invasion of a virus into the heart tissue, it’s the immune system itself that affects the heart after vaccination.“There must be some cross-reactivity in some patients between their immune response to the vaccine and their heart muscles,” he says.Facilities have taken different approaches to treating post-vaccination myocarditis, ranging from over-the-counter pain medication to intravenous medications and steroids. More clarity on mechanisms, as well as long-term follow-up studies, should help clarify the best treatment strategies. Further study may also explain why the condition is more common among males and how long recovery should be expected to take. Guzman-Cottrill plans to rescan her seven patients in August, three months after their initial diagnosis.Given the latest numbers and the still-real risk of severe complications from COVID-19 among young people, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome, experts continue to recommend vaccination for teenagers.“In the patients in this age group that we saw who were adversely affected by COVID, there were some very severe cases, so I still think that vaccination is appropriate,” Asnes says. “Like with any new therapy, we have to keep our eyes open. And that's what we're doing.",
"As the Biden administration works to accelerate the U.S. coronavirus vaccine rollout, it could soon have a new tool: A single-dose vaccine that can survive up to three months in an ordinary refrigerator.Manufacturer Johnson & Johnson released data on January 29 showing that its single-dose version provided strong protection against COVID-19. On February 24, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an analysis of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine confirming that it is safe and effective, and on February 26 a review committee within the agency recommended that the FDA authorize the shot for emergency use.The news comes with two caveats: The candidate’s efficacy rate—72 percent in the United States—is lower than the 95 percent rates boasted by the two-dose versions from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that are currently approved for use in the U.S.Follow vaccine developments with our vaccine tracker.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine also provided less immunity among trial participants in South Africa, where a set of mutations threatens to accelerate the deadliness of the global pandemic. In that study, the efficacy rate was just 57 percent—although a more recent analysis has upped that number to 64 percent. The manufacturers of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have reported similar concerns with their vaccines, and are studying different dosing and formulation strategies in the event new variants of the coronavirus outwit their vaccines.If approved, though, experts say the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine could streamline a national COVID-19 vaccination administration campaign that has been criticized as scattered and lethargic. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna versions must be given in two doses several weeks apart.“This could be a game-changer because it’s one dose,” says Bruce Y. Lee, professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health, who studies pharmaceutical supply chains. “It’s easier to administer. With two doses, you have to get people to come back for a second. It’s going to be easier to manufacture; you have to produce half as many doses.”The absence of stringent temperature requirements for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine also means increased access across health systems and communities. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit and is good for five days in a refrigerator. Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted data to the FDA showing that their vaccine is stable at temperatures more commonly found in pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators, but that evidence is still under review. Moderna’s version is shipped frozen and lasts up to 30 days in a refrigerator.“Many clinics in lower income areas or rural neighborhoods might not have freezer space period, but they have refrigeration. It increases the range of places that can get the vaccines,” says Lee.Another potential advantage of Johnson & Johnson’s candidate is that it’s made from a vaccine platform with a track record: the viral-vector approach, which the company used in its Ebola virus vaccine approved by the European Commission in July. By contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are based on messenger RNA technology that was first authorized for use in humans in December.Viral-vector technology uses an adenovirus, which causes the common cold. The strain of adenovirus used in the vaccine platform is engineered not to replicate, so that it doesn’t make the recipient sick. Rather, it serves as a vehicle to transport a gene from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that carries instructions to develop a part of the coronavirus—known as the spike protein—that allows it to invades cells. When introduced into the body, the altered adenovirus injects the gene into cell nuclei to produce the spike protein.Yet the spike protein versions created by viral-vector vaccines are enough to fool the body into triggering an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 without causing an all-out infection. COVID-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA), on the other hand, carry the instructions for generating spike proteins via RNA encoding for the spike protein coated with lipid nanoparticles.“Conceptually it’s the same thing,” says Aliasger K. Salem, chair of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Iowa. “The adenovirus is just like messenger RNA, but it uses a different vector.”The significance of the Johnson & Johnson viral-vector vaccine, Salem adds, is that the company already has the knowledge of best practices and manufacturing infrastructure in place to quickly scale up production, if given the green light by the FDA.It’s clear that Johnson & Johnson’s would gain competitive advantage by designing a single-dose regimen, but unknown whether its vaccine might provide better or longer protection if given with a booster shot. The company is currently attempting to answer that question by recruiting for a separate study that will give participants two doses spaced two months apart.Such an additional dose could be a useful strategy for pharmaceutical companies to address new and worrisome variants of the virus that arise over time. For example, Moderna has said although it expects its current vaccine version to work against recently discovered variants from the U.K. and South Africa, its researchers planned to test a booster dose—a third shot in addition to the two-dose series—that would include specific spike proteins against emerging strains. One Moderna booster shot targeting the South African variant is already being studied in the U.S.In late January, Pfizer-BioNTech announced new data showing that although its current vaccine formulation was slightly less effective against the South African variant, it still provided protection. Yet the companies were prepared to respond if it stopped providing immunity.Viral-vector vaccines are also easily customizable, says Salem, whether as an emergency booster shot or a reconfigured single dose. “The industry has a long track record and experience with inserting new sequences into viral vectors so they can readily adapt to new variants,” he says.Whatever the FDA decides, several questions remain.Will Johnson & Johnson’s “one-and-done” regimen convince more people to get a coronavirus vaccine? Or will the company’s successful track record with the viral-vector Ebola vaccine—in contrast to the new mRNA technology used by currently approved coronavirus vaccines—provide the necessary reassurance for people to sign up for the shot?“I worry the word mRNA scares people. People are worried that it might mess with their genetics,” says Julie Swann, head of the department of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University who studies health care systems. “We just don’t have the history with this particular kind of vaccine, even though we’ve been looking at this mRNA technology for a long time.”Ultimately, convenience might matter more. “I don’t think most people dig into the details and actual mechanisms of vaccines,” says Austin Baldwin, an associate professor of psychology who studies vaccine decision-making at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.Baldwin predicts the single-dose approach will result in increased vaccination rates. “The very fact that it’s a single dose means you’d expect compliance to be better. It reduces perceived barriers,” he says. “It’s easier to get one than two.”Yet harder decisions still loom, as health officials have to weigh easier access with reduced protection, compared to the other two vaccines that are available. Despite reports of Johnson & Johnson’s lower efficacy rates, there were hopeful findings: The vaccine was 85 percent effective in preventing severe disease across the globe, and none of the vaccinated patients were admitted to the hospital. Plus, Johnson & Johnson has said it could produce 100 million doses by the end of June—providing a much-needed boost to the nation’s supply.“One of my big questions is who should be given the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, if we know it’s less effective,” says Swann. “That’s a big issue. You wouldn’t want there to be inequities among different communities.”If and when U.S. consumers are able to choose among available vaccine brands, they will also have to ask themselves which kind is best for them: one of the two-dose mRNA vaccines that give more than 90 percent protection?“Or should I get the one dose and I won’t have to come back?” Swann says.Editor's Note: This story has been updated with the latest FDA authorization status of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

"This colorized microscope image shows a dying cell (green) infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (blue), isolated from a patient.After a year of isolation, canceled events, and virtual meetings, pandemic fatigue is setting in. But even as more people let their guard down and allow safety measures to slip, a crop of fast-spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 is moving through populations around the world. The rapid rise of a trio of mutated viruses hints at an increase in transmissibility, speeding the virus' leaps from one host to the next.Scientists are now racing to decipher exactly how the jumble of mutations in each variant influences viral spread. This research is vital to understanding the risks from current lineages and predicting how future variants could alter the course of the pandemic."We have uncontrolled viral spread in much of the world," says Adam Lauring, an infectious disease physician and virologist at the University of Michigan. "So the virus has a lot of opportunity to evolve."More cases mean more deaths and more people who suffer lasting impacts from bouts with COVID-19—but not all the news is gloom and doom. For one, the latest analyses of vaccines suggest that they remain effective against the new variants. And until people are vaccinated, the same measures already known to prevent infection—such as masking, distancing, hand washing, ventilation, and spending time outdoors—become even more important to stem the viral tide.“The variants may be more transmissible, but physics has not changed,” says Müge Çevik, an infectious disease physician at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.A virus replicates by hijacking its host’s cellular machinery to make copies of itself. But like a person making mistakes when they type out the same sentence over and over, the genetic copies accumulate small errors, or mutations. Many changes don’t affect the virus' function, and some even harm SARS-CoV-2's ability to multiply, but they keep happening. “Viruses mutate; that’s what they do,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut.Sometimes neutral mutations are passed on by chance and can become common in a population. But changes that are beneficial to the virus can also drive its spread, leading to a variant that outcompetes other local varieties and may send cases surging.That seems to be what happened in the U.K., Brazil, and South Africa. In the United Kingdom, variant B.1.1.7 likely drove the region's record-setting spike of COVID-19 cases in January. The variant is now circulating in more than 60 countries, including the United States—and projections suggest it will become the most common virus variety in the U.S. by mid-March.An independently arising lineage called P.1 might also be driving a wave of cases in Manaus, Brazil, where it accounted for nearly half of new COVID-19 infections in December. On January 26, Minnesotan officials reported the first U.S. case of P.1 in a resident who previously traveled to Brazil. And a third lineage raising alarms, known as B.1.351, was first spotted amid a December wave of infections in South Africa. On January 28, the first known U.S. cases of the variant were reported in South Carolina.But exactly how the mutations gave the variants a leg up remains uncertain. One specific mutation, known as N501Y, popped up independently in all three variants, suggesting it could provide an advantage to the virus. “That’s a sign that there is natural selection going on,” Lauring says.The N501Y mutation affects the virus’ spike protein, which is the key it uses to unlock entry into its host’s cells. Laboratory experiments suggest that this mutation improves the spike protein’s ability to bind to the cells, hinting that it could increase the variants’ ability to infect hosts.Another possibility is that new variants cause people who are infected to harbor more copies of the virus. This results in greater viral “shedding” in airborne droplets spewed when people talk, sing, cough, and breath. But different studies have produced conflicting results, and the largest study on the topic suggests the new variants are unlikely to increase viral load, Çevik says. The discrepancy may come from the timing of the studies, she adds, since past research suggests viral loads increase as infections in the community rise.Mutations can also help viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 spread in many other ways. Some could make sick people contagious for longer periods of time, for example. Other changes could help viruses survive for longer outside of the body, or even increase their ability to replicate. And to complicate matters, the individual tweaks to the virus’s genome might function differently on their own than they do as a patchwork of mutations.Scientists are also puzzling through another crucial question: Exactly how much more contagious are the new coronavirus variants? As evidence for B.1.1.7’s movement through the population grows, one recent model suggests it’s 56 percent more transmissible than past forms of the virus—but these are challenging numbers to pin down.Without routine screening, many SARS-CoV-2 infections still slip under the radar, says Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health in Massachusetts. This makes it tough to get an accurate picture of what’s going on. Our own human complexities also present a challenge, such as the differences in susceptibility between people.“Overall, when you're talking about complicated, messy human beings living their normal lives—or at least their COVID normal lives—it’s really hard to put an exact number to increased transmissibility, especially when you’re looking at this in real time,” says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security in Washington, D.C.Scientists are less certain about the increased transmissibility of the variants first spotted in Brazil and South Africa. As the P.1 lineage raced through Manaus, more than 70 percent of the local population had already been infected with previous versions of the virus, which was theoretically high enough to achieve herd immunity. But then cases surged, raising concerns that the variant could bypass the immune defenses of people who’d been previously infected.Similar concerns have been raised regarding the variant initially found in South Africa, which shares some mutations with P.1. One modeling effort suggests that the spread of 501Y.V2 could be explained by an increase in transmissibility of around 50 percent. But it could alternatively be the result of 501Y.V2 evading immunity in 21 percent of previously infected people—and it's possible both mechanisms work in tandem.“It’s really hard to know which is which,” says Penny Moore, a virologist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.Moore and her colleagues used “pseudoviruses” that infect cells using the same proteins as SARS-CoV-2, but are not capable of replication, to study the possibility of the virus dodging our immune systems. Her results suggest that mutations in 501Y.V2 could diminish the effectiveness of antibodies in the blood of people previously infected with the virus. But understanding whether that could lead to more re-infections, or if it could affect vaccine efficacy, will require further study, she says."What we don’t know yet—nobody knows this—is how much antibody is enough to be able to protect people from infection," Moore says. "What we need are the clinical trials in humans to truly answer whether this reduces vaccine efficacy."The rise of the variants emphasizes the need for greater precautions against the virus, particularly as vaccine rollout remains sluggish. Testing, masks, and social distancing will all help stem the viral spread. And as people grow weary of isolation, Çevik stresses that these measures need to be employed in smart ways, allowing activity where risk is low, such as outdoors.In enclosed spaces—including the small hutches now commonly used for outdoor dining, Murray says—the virus has a greater chance of building in the air and infecting people with COVID-19. Contact tracing has shown that the risk of viral transmission indoors is 20 times greater than outdoors. While some risk is still present outside, it's extremely low for brief contact between people, Çevik says."We need to look at risk in a spectrum," she says, and think more about when we let our guard down. “I think people are worrying about outdoor strangers, but they forget everything when they have dinner with their friends.”Many researchers are also pushing for better face masks. While they're not a panacea, and should still be combined with other measures like social distancing, masks can help staunch viral spread when people must enter high-risk areas. Abraar Karan, an internal medicine physician at the Brigham and Women's Hospital of Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts, has been advocating to dramatically scale up production of high-filtration masks for the general public. "We’re at war with this virus,” he says. ”It’s not a joke."Experts also stress that government support is key in efforts to halt transmission. People need the resources to safely isolate—places to quarantine and the financial support to stay home from work if ill. And speeding up vaccinations is vital, since that will stem the virus’s opportunities to replicate and evolve. “The quicker we can get people vaccinated, the less likelihood of more of these variants coming out,” Iwasaki says.Some help may be on the way in the U.S. as President Joe Biden works to enact his administration's $1.9 trillion plan to combat the pandemic. Even so, people will need to work together to stay vigilant and slow the virus’s spread.“This is not forever; this is not necessarily even the next six months,” Rasmussen says. But “right now, the immediate future is not the time to relax.”",
"Pedestrians walk along the Riv​er Thames in London, October 18, ​2020.In early December, cases of COVID-19 soared in Kent, England—and scientists wanted to know why. For clues, Nick Loman, who is part of the COVID-19 Genomics Consortium U.K., and his colleagues examined how the coronavirus was mutating. By looking at this zoo of slightly different viruses, they could roughly track the outbreak’s spread through the community.For SARS-CoV-2, these mutations—the small errors made naturally when genomes are copied—develop at a steady pace of one or two each month, says Loman, a professor of microbial genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham. Yet among the Kent cases, scientists found a large cluster that was remarkably different, with a total of 23 mutations arising without prior notice and faster than anyone expected."That's how many mutations you have to go back to get to anything we'd seen before," he says. "That's a very striking and unusual finding."This discovery is part of what led British officials to sound the alarm last week. A follow-up investigation by Public Health England showed that the variant, known as B.1.1.7 or 501Y.V1, began to thrive at a time when cases were spiking in Kent and other parts of southeastern England. Retroactive tracing through a database of samples tied B.1.1.7 to patients as early as September 20. But by mid-November, the variant made up between 20 and 30 percent of cases in London and a region east of the city. Three weeks later, it was roughly 60 percent. And on December 23, U.K. scientists announced a separate SARS-CoV-2 variant reported last week in South Africa had now been spotted in two people in England.  (Related: Africa’s first COVID-19 wave was atypical. Its second could be, too.)Scientists are still uncertain about how the cluster of mutations arose or what they mean long-term for the virus’s transmission. One possible hypothesis for their origin involves chronically ill patients treated with experimental therapies like convalescent plasma donated by recovered COVID-19 patients. In such lengthy illnesses, the virus has more opportunities to replicate, increasing the odds for mutations. The consistent use of the therapies, meanwhile, may put more pressure on the germ to evolve.“Some of these people who are chronically infected have some quite big shifts in the virus,” says Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge. “Some are immune-suppressed. Some of them have had convalescent plasma. Some of them have had [the antiviral] remdesivir.”If this suspected origin story does prove to be the case, it could have implications for treatment, says Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at the University of St. Andrews. Earlier in the pandemic, the best path for helping patients was unclear. That led hospitals to give patients a buffet of therapies, with the hope that some combination might work. But if new-wave medicines like antivirals and antibody therapy contributed to the development of viral variants, it will be “a reminder for all the medical community that we need to use these treatment options carefully.”While mutations edit genetic code, they don’t always lead to outward changes in a germ or organism. That’s why these newfound variants have garnered so much concern. It’s as if the virus entered a dressing room and came out with a new outfit, rather than the normal circumstances where it would only change its hat.Of the 23 mutations in the United Kingdom's variant, 17 are at positions in the genome that alter the building blocks that make up the virus’s proteins, as described in a recent COVID-19 Genomics Consortium report from Loman and his colleagues. The consortium stated such a large shift is so far “unprecedented” for the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight of those changes lie in the region that encodes for the spike protein—the key that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells.While there is no direct evidence that this collection of mutations influences the severity of disease, modeling and prior laboratory work hints at the possibility that it could make the virus more contagious. A greater abundance of cases could mean more hospitalizations and deaths.For example, lab experiments suggest that one of the observed deletions that eliminates two building blocks in the spike—dubbed H69 and V70—may double the viral infectiousness, according to a recent preprint. Other research hints that another mutation—N501Y—increases the spike protein’s binding capability. This one also independently arose in the South African variant (501Y.V2), which was first detected in October. But more work is necessary to determine if and how these changes might translate to differences in human transmission, Cevik says.On December 18, the U.K.’s advisory panel for emerging respiratory outbreaks—which includes Cevik and some members of the COVID-19 Genomics Consortium—released a preliminary assessment of the variant. Their modeling hints that the variant might account for up to 70 percent greater transmission, but this takeaway is uncertain, Cevik cautions. Some of the spread could originate from human behavior, for instance more group gathering under loosened restrictions. More time, more research, and the country’s latest round of stay-at-home orders may yield clarity on the matter.“Models are informative but not concrete,” Cevik says. She noted that the answer will likely come from a combination of evidence from a variety of fields—epidemiology, virology, genomics, as well as modeling. “Everything together tells us a story.”Where the story of B.1.1.7 begins is also a tantalizing mystery. Many scientists are pointing to the possibility of extra opportunities for viral evolution in people with compromised immune systems. These patients tend to suffer from chronic infections, during which the coronavirus can linger for weeks or even months.Such a situation presents additional chances to replicate and accrue random mutations. One case report of a 45-year-old immunocompromised man, who was infected for nearly five months before succumbing, documented “accelerated viral evolution.” Most of the mutations occurred in the spike protein, including changes present in both variants under scrutiny in the U.K. and South Africa.“The virus has just got a chance to stretch its legs a little bit,” Loman explains. After a year of closely tracking these mutations, scientists know that most don’t do anything noteworthy. Some are even harmful to the virus’s ability to multiply. For example, one mutation widely touted this year—D614G—increases coronavirus replication and infectivity while also making the germ more vulnerable to neutralization by antibodies.But pressure from partially effective therapies for chronic patients could be part of the evolutionary push that allows some mutations beneficial for the virus to thrive. The idea is similar to HIV patients developing resistances to treatment after taking incomplete drug courses, says Gupta, who has spent a decade studying HIV resistance. “If you take a sledgehammer to a nut you can always crack it,” he says. But scientists don’t yet have a sledgehammer-like therapy for chronic COVID-19 patients.For example, convalescent plasma has large differences in potency between doses thanks to natural variation between the array of antibodies produced by the immune systems of the donors, he says.A few case studies hint at this kind of rapid evolution for chronically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. In a recent preprint article, Gupta and his colleagues document mutation of the virus after a patient received three treatments of convalescent plasma starting at day 63 of their illness. Two of the viral mutations developed in genes that code for the spike protein. Something similar happened inside a 65-year-old cancer patient who survived after 105 days with the virus. And one of the mutations recently spotted in the South African variant—N439K—may allow the virus to bypass monoclonal antibody drugs, according to a preprint released by the COVID-19 Genomics Consortium in November.Similar rapid viral evolution has also occurred in patients with influenza, says Emma Hodcroft, co-developer of Nextstrain, a global repository that tracks pathogen evolution in real time. Still, she cautions that there could be other origin stories. “There’s almost never just one way to do something in biology,” she says.For example, a 2017 mathematical model of the stomach-churning norovirus predicted that immunocompromised individuals are too rare to generate variants that spread widely. Alternatively, uncontrolled spread may just offer enough chances for the virus to mutate in regular people with short bouts with the disease, says Mark Tanaka, a mathematical and computational biologist at the University of New South Wales Sydney, who is an author of the study. Both Pfizer and Moderna are checking if the variants can escape the antibodies generated by their respective vaccines, but pioneering scientists behind these drugs believe this scenario to be unlikely.Hodcroft stresses that the discovery of the U.K. variant emphasizes the importance of genomic sequencing in COVID-19 surveillance. Out of the U.K.'s 2.1 million cases, the COVID-19 Genomics Consortium has sequenced 137,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes total, which is about half of all those sequenced worldwide. Contrast that with the United States, which has sequenced only about 51,000 of its 18 million cases.Such enhanced genomic testing explains why scientists in the U.K. were able to act so fast and warn others as B.1.1.7 slowly started to trickle into Denmark, The Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, Hong Kong, and Australia—and how they just discovered two cases of the variant linked to South Africa.“If we can try to put the effort in right now to try to identify who these people might be, get them tested, get them into quarantine, it might be that we can actually stamp [it] out,” says Hodcroft, adding that there is no time to waste. “We might be able to do that with 100 people, it’ll be much much harder if we had thousands.”",
"A coronavirus wall mural in Accra, Ghana, on Oct. 23, 2020.Coronavirus cases are rising again in several African countries and could undo gains made earlier in the pandemic. Experts fear a more devastating second surge could be caused by relaxed restrictions, mounting COVID-19 fatigue, the emergence of a new variant in South Africa, and the upcoming holiday season.“We are very close to where we were at the peak of the pandemic in July and August,” said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres of Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, via a virtual news conference on December 17. “My projection is that, with the holiday season, we will probably exceed that number by January or February."But Africa’s pandemic response isn’t a continental monolith; rather, more than 50 countries are on separate COVID journeys. National Geographic took a closer look at three of them, in which unexpected outbreaks, death surges fueled by stigma, and puzzlingly places defined by abundant spread but low hospitalization rates have made it difficult to predict the course of the pandemic.When COVID-19 sprouted in Africa, governments responded swiftly. Most closed their borders, some even before registering a single case. They imposed harsh lockdowns, or at least banned gatherings, and insisted on mask-wearing in public—actions that health experts say helped keep the first wave of the pandemic manageable.This time around, however, most of the continent is not returning to lockdowns to curb its rising case numbers. And Africa is unlikely to receive a substantial volume of vaccines until the middle of next year, experts say. Adherence to interventions like social distancing and mask-wearing will be vital to preventing rapid spread, Nkengasong said.Africa’s COVID-19 numbers have remained mercifully low this year. Despite being home to 17 percent of the world’s population, the continent has only reported 3.4 percent of global COVID-19 cases and 3.5 percent of deaths.The continent’s youth is one obvious reason. Africa’s median age is below 20, half that of the United States, and older adults are more likely to develop severe cases of the disease. Some scientists believe the warmer climate is playing a role, as it allows people to spend more time outside where COVID-19 risk is lower. Other researchers believe exposure to parasitic infections or other widely-circulating coronaviruses—such as those that cause the common cold—could have primed African immune systems to fight COVID-19. But there is little evidence so far to support these theories.Early in the pandemic, many health experts worried that Africa’s high burden of other diseases and ill-equipped healthcare systems might cancel out the benefits of its youthful population. But those fears didn’t come true. Few African countries have seen their hospitals overwhelmed with severe COVID-19 cases, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients is 80 percent in Africa—higher than elsewhere—says the World Health Organization.Still, as Nkengasong has repeatedly pointed out in recent weeks, complacency going forward into 2021 could prove deadly. New COVID-19 cases in Africa peaked in July and August at around 18,000 per day before dropping to 7,000 a month later. Since then, they have grown and, in mid-December, are threatening to break records.South Africa, one of the continent’s most industrialized countries, had hoped that the combination of summertime and acquired immunity from the first wave would hold the coronavirus at bay over the economically significant Christmas holiday season. In the past month, however, the virus has made an unexpected comeback and is spreading faster than ever.By the end of August, more than 14,000 South Africans had lost their lives to COVID-19, even though the first wave had peaked a month earlier with fewer active cases than predicted by the country’s most optimistic disease models.That initial wave abated by September, which was surprising given that the government had begun easing restrictions in May, according to Juliet Pulliam, director of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis in Stellenbosch. Pulliam believes the spread was curbed by mask-wearing and handwashing, combined with rapidly rising immunity levels due to fast-spreading infections. This theory was backed by a survey in late July of pregnant mothers and people living with HIV in Cape Town’s poor suburbs, which found that around 40 percent of them had antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, an indicator of potential immunity.As spring arrived in the Southern Hemisphere, neither Pulliam nor any of her colleagues on the country’s coronavirus modeling consortium expected a second wave before Christmas—and then a sudden spike in cases arrived in the Eastern Cape province in November. Incidents are rising in December in other coastal cities like Cape Town and Durban, where student end-of-year parties sparked super-spreader events.“There can no longer be any doubt—the country has entered a second wave of coronavirus infections,” South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced in a December 14 televised address. Four days later, the county’s scientists identified a new coronavirus variant dubbed 501Y.V2, which they think could transmit more easily between people and could be driving the second wave. While 501Y.V2 shares some mutations with another variant thriving in the United Kingdom, the pair arose separately.Before the new variant was common knowledge, Pulliam’s best explanation for the resurgence of coronavirus in South Africa was that the country eventually reached a tipping point after the economy reopened akin to other nations in Europe and North America, and people became more relaxed about social distancing and other restrictions. With southern hemisphere summer holidays coming up, there’s a concern that many South Africans who travel to see their families will further speed up the spread, she adds.The nation’s second wave started in the harbor city of Port Elizabeth, the Eastern Cape’s largest metropolis. By mid-November, infection rates, hospital admissions, and deaths were higher than during the previous peak in July. Several hospitals reported having to turn people away because their wards were full. Many people were likely dying from COVID-19 without a diagnosis: The city recorded 420 more deaths than usual the penultimate week of November—the rest of the province only recorded 250 official COVID-19 fatalities over the same period.Port Elizabeth’s coronavirus flood spilled into nearby villages and towns as well. In Kenton-on-Sea, a popular beachside tourist town a little over an hour’s drive up the coast, local doctors treated severe COVID-19 patients in their homes because the intensive care beds in Port Elizabeth were full. The community has pulled together to care for the sick, says local physician Eleanor Galpin. She says a retired anesthesiologist helped her with the oxygen setup for very ill patients.On December 3, Ramaphosa tightened Port Elizabeth’s coronavirus restrictions. To relieve the pressure on hospitals, officials told shops they could only sell alcohol from Monday to Thursday, and nightclubs had to close by 10 pm. A little over a week later, the South African president extended these restrictions nationwide and closed access to many of the country’s beaches—a blow for the seaside communities that depend on December holidaymakers.Still, the restrictions this time around are a far cry from the harsh lockdown introduced earlier this year, says Tom Moultrie, professor of demography at the University of Cape Town. The government has “shied away” from hard lockdown in the recent surge, he says—something he attributes both to the extensive spread of new cases, as well as the economic consequences of hard lockdowns. The coastal outbreaks, combined with holiday travel, create a “very real” prospect of a nationwide resurgence in early 2021, Moultrie says.The first clues arrived in July when autopsies of Zambia’s dead kept testing positive for COVID-19. Though coronavirus takes days to weeks to truly devastate organs, this time window wasn’t large enough, and people were dying before they could even seek care. As a result, the nation’s hospitals weren’t overrun with patients, but their morgues took a toll.By early September, such “brought in dead” casualties made up almost 75 percent of Zambia’s official pandemic count of 295 individuals. In a paper published in October, biomedical scientist Mischeck Chileshe and his colleagues wrote that Zambians weren’t only reluctant to seek healthcare for COVID-19 but that some were also increasingly embracing a perception that the illness is not real. Chileshe says fear of testing, isolation, and lost income has likely dissuaded many people from looking for medical care. Had they been admitted to a hospital, their outcomes could have been vastly different. “I personally think most of them could have been saved,” he says.Zambia, a lower-middle-income country with a population of 17 million, has not seen a reemergence in coronavirus since its August peak. As of December 18, its official toll—including those brought in dead—was 18,575 cases and 373 deaths. Yet last month, health minister Chitalu Chilufya warned that Zambians were becoming complacent. He urged them to wear masks in public once more and keep their distance or risk a second wave of COVID-19.If cases bounce back, Chileshe worries that stigma will once more prevent Zambians from getting tested and treated in time. The hidden toll could be significant in Zambia’s rural areas, where around 40 percent of the population lives, he adds.People who die in those areas are less likely than town-dwellers to be brought to morgues, a legal requirement in the country, but only urban or peri-urban areas strictly enforce it, he explains. “So in the villages, when somebody dies, they are usually just buried,” he says.In West Africa, Ghana saw an uptick in cases as the country geared up for its December election. Since then, daily incidents have dropped again—but official cases are likely a vast undercount of actual infections, scientists in the country have discovered.Yaw Bediako is one of the millions of Ghanaians who cast their ballots in the country’s general election on December 7. He says the voting stations had hand-washing stations, and voters adhered to pandemic protocols like social distancing.“I must admit I was impressed,” says the Accra-based immunologist, who has pivoted from studying malaria to COVID-19 since the start of the 2020. Earlier this year, a different picture greeted Bediako and his colleagues at the West African Center for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP). They set out to test more than 1,300 people for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Accra, the country’s capital, from July to September.“Most people were maskless” in the markets and transport hubs surveyed by the scientists, says Peter Kojo Quashie, the virologist who co-led the study. “If you went out in public wearing a mask, people would look at you funny.”When COVID-19 arrived in Ghana in March, officials locked down activities for three weeks. As restrictions eased and deaths stayed low, the government became preoccupied with election preparations, possibly to the detriment of Ghana’s testing and tracing efforts, says Quashie. Tidy polling stations were a welcome contrast from the crowded election rallies that many health experts feared would spread the virus. Now, with the election done, there’s hope that the government will once more turn its focus on the novel coronavirus, which Quashie says is much more widespread in the country that its politicians have wanted to admit.Ghana has documented more than 50,000 infections to date, with cases spiking in July and August. Since the peak, new incidents have, on average, hovered around 100 per day. However, these official numbers are likely a vast undercount. In their study, which has been presented but is yet unpublished, Quashie and Bediako found that one in every five people in their random sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, indicating that they had likely previously caught the virus.Even if that infection rate were limited to the capital and its 5 million inhabitants, it would still translate to one million cases—a twenty-fold increase in official countrywide data. Quashie and Bedikao believe such estimates are closer to the truth, and they also think that the drop recorded after the first ‘wave’ might be an artifact of testing efforts that have focused more narrowly on travelers and severe cases in recent months than they did at the start of the outbreak.However, with only 331 nationwide deaths reported as of December 18 and with hospitals not yet showing significant strain, it’s clear that something unusual is going on in Ghana. “COVID is freely spreading in our community, but it appears that our mortality rates are significantly lower than what we see in a lot of the world,” Bediako says.Bediako and his colleagues—as well as other scientists around the continent—are puzzled as to why this might be. Bediako’s boss, WACCBIP director Gordon Awandare, says his preferred theory is that people in Ghana could have a higher tolerance to inflammation because they are bombarded with pro-inflammatory infections like malaria.A few years ago, Awandare was part of a team that showed that Ghanaians who live in areas where there are lots of malaria infections have less intense inflammatory responses to the parasitic disease than those in urban areas where malaria was rarer. Such tolerance could, in theory, help Africans fight COVID-19, as it’s thought to be the body’s overblown inflammatory response that causes severe disease and death, he says. “That’s what may be protecting us.”Even so, neither Quashie nor Bediako thinks it is time to relax. The epidemic has been managed so far, but it might not remain so, they say, primarily if the virus spreads to remote areas where people have poor access to healthcare.“Without a vaccine, COVID [will be] in Ghana for quite a while,” says Bediako. “It will not be killing as many people as elsewhere, but people are still dying from it. So we can’t take it lightly.”",
"Convalescent plasma has been used for more than a century to fight infectious diseases, but is it ready to battle COVID-19?Hopes ran high earlier this year that transferring the liquid part of blood from recovered COVID-19 patients to people with the disease could be a remedy for the worst cases of the pandemic virus. Doctors have relied on this old-school treatment—known as convalescent plasma—to fight outbreaks since before the 1918 flu pandemic. Given this blood plasma comes packed with antibodies, which tag germ invaders like the coronavirus for destruction, this therapy has long served as a simple way to share immunity.But months after this effort began, the data on convalescent plasma hasn’t yet confirmed its effectiveness for treating COVID-19, despite more than 70 clinical studies happening worldwide. Now, one of those investigations finds itself in the middle of an academic and political firestorm.On August 23—a day after accusing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of slow-walking therapies and vaccines for the coronavirus—President Donald Trump announced the FDA’s emergency authorization of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19. The Trump Administration’s latest move in the race to approve pandemic therapies was based largely on positive preliminary results released earlier this month by the Mayo Clinic, a world-renowned medical center headquartered in Rochester, Minnesota. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, reported that giving plasma within three days of hospitalization lowered the patient death rate by 3.2 percent.But even though this study has received millions of federal dollars and involved tens of thousands of U.S. patients, it has one glaring flaw. The study lacks a control group—people who didn’t receive plasma—to serve as a point of comparison. This pitfall makes the Mayo Clinic’s findings harder to interpret, and it is part of a broader trend of shortcomings in early studies of convalescent plasma.“I'm hopeful that institutions and individuals will recognize that the issue is far from settled,” says Daniel Culver, a pulmonologist with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. While he says research into convalescent plasma is still showing promise overall, he and others are concerned that the FDA’s authorization will be seen as a fuller endorsement, causing more patients and physicians to request a still unproven treatment.The Mayo Clinic project grew from a grassroots effort by doctors from across the country, who envisioned two ways to immediately deploy convalescent plasma. One was well-vetted clinical trials, and for the other, the team envisioned a network of “compassionate use” or “expanded access” programs that would provide plasma to people with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms, outside of traditional FDA approvals.One concept, however, ended up dwarfing the other. While expanded-access programs took off far beyond its proponents’ expectations, a lack of dedicated funding and infrastructure slowed down efforts to launch clinical trials.“What I’ve learned from the experience is that the system is not designed at the moment to rapidly roll out a trial,” says Liise-anne Pirofski, an antibody expert and chief of the division of infectious diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “It’s not that there wasn’t a protocol, it’s not that there weren’t willing investigators, and it’s not that there weren’t willing patients—but what there wasn’t was funding, and there wasn’t any organized oversight.”As WIRED reported on August 21, expanded-access programs in the U.S. grew rapidly to more than 2,700 hospitals, some of which had little of the setup or know-how to run clinical trials. The Mayo Clinic’s program alone has received $48 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to use convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients.“Its popularity gave the impression that it was the golden liquid that gave a cure, and that was inaccurate,” says Mila Ortigoza, an infectious diseases specialist at NYU Langone Health. “The truth is, there’s signals out there—every non-randomized study right now shows a positive sign for plasma—but we don’t have the confidence to say that it works.”The gold standard of medical evidence is a large trial in which subjects with a disease randomly receive either a real therapy or a placebo as part of a control group. But so far, researchers around the world have run either small trials or observational studies, such as the one at the Mayo Clinic, that forgo the use of a placebo. Without a control group, it’s hard to glean whether people would have gotten better on their own or had the same results without receiving convalescent plasma.“Frankly, you have no idea at the end of it whether the tens of thousands of people who got convalescent plasma were helped, harmed, or it made no difference. You just can’t tell,” says Oxford cardiology professor Martin Landray, the co-lead of the U.K.’s RECOVERY COVID-19 trials.On July 30, a group led by the Mayo Clinic’s Michael Joyner uploaded a review article to medRxiv that argues that when the small-scale studies’ findings are combined, they suggest a benefit to using convalescent plasma with COVID-19 patients. In a 17-page memo, the FDA rationalized its actions by citing the same trials and studies, as well as the broader Mayo Clinic expanded-use results. Pirofski, a co-author on the review article, says that the authorization is justified on the merits, despite the visible pressure on the FDA.“I believe in science, I believe in data, [and] I have every reason to believe that this decision hinged on that,” she says. “There’s been a confluence of events that has been really unfortunate.”The FDA’s emergency authorization isn’t the same thing as “FDA approval,” a stringent threshold no COVID-19 therapeutic has met so far in the U.S. The FDA said in a statement that “COVID-19 convalescent plasma does not yet represent a new standard of care based on the current available evidence,” but rather that “it is reasonable to conclude that the known and potential benefits of [convalescent plasma] outweigh the known and potential risks.”Even so, the Trump Administration’s support of convalescent plasma—and earlier championing of the now-debunked hydroxychloroquine—has raised questions among scientists about whether the president will pressure the FDA to speed up approvals ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. On August 23, the Financial Times reported that Trump Administration officials were considering fast-tracking a COVID-19 vaccine for this fall, well before large-scale clinical trials are expected to be finished. On August 20, Reuters reported that a top FDA official had vowed to resign if the agency prematurely approved an unproven vaccine. And the federal government has already committed $8 million to digital and radio advertisements asking Americans to donate plasma, despite its lack of approval.For now, University of Arizona researcher and ICU medical director Christian Bime isn’t concerned about political pressure—out of confidence in the scientists embedded in the process.“I trust scientists to do the right thing,” Bime said in an email to National Geographic. “The stakes are too high and the consequences too dire for scientists to not follow best practice.”The confusion around convalescent plasma highlights one of the many stumbling blocks in the U.S.’s response to COVID-19: the lack of a coordinated, national clinical trial process.Pirofski is currently leading a randomized, controlled trial of convalescent plasma that’s recruited 190 patients so far. When the trial began in New York City on April 17, it didn’t have any federal funding. Although she, Ortigoza, and their colleagues raced to recruit patients, cases in New York City ebbed within weeks of the trial starting, slowing its progress to a crawl. Only now, months later, has funding come through from the U.S. National Institutes of Health to expand the trial to Connecticut, Florida, and Texas. “We’ve been playing kind of catch-up ball,” she says.Doctors interviewed by National Geographic said that they’re waiting to see randomized clinical trials that confirm convalescent plasma’s effectiveness.“There are theoretical and actual risks from infusions of human plasma, and possibly additional risks from low titer plasma [plasma with low levels of antibodies] that have not been adequately evaluated,” Culver says. “That [risk] can only be evaluated through randomized controlled trials.”",
"This transmission electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—isolated from a patient in the U.S. Virus particles are shown emerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab. The spikes on the outer edge of the virus particles give coronaviruses their name, crown-like. Image captured and colorized at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, Montana.Mutations sound scary. They’re a common theme in our collective fear of nuclear radiation or insidious cancers. In a pandemic when so much remains unknown, even the suggestion that the virus is changing for the worse, getting more infectious or more lethal, intensifies our anxiety.Hence it was no surprise that the news was flooded with frightful headlines in early July, after a study published in Cell, a prestigious journal, claimed a mutant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus had quietly taken over the world—possibly because it was more transmissible.In early March, the study said, this mighty mutant had accounted for only 10 percent of specimens pulled from patients around the world. But by May, it had obtained global dominance, accounting for 78 percent. The researchers reported laboratory experiments suggesting that the mutation in question—a single change in the “spike” protein that studs the virus like a crown—could somehow improve the virus’s ability to get into human cells and reproduce.There’s no doubt that viruses mutate; that’s why we need a new version of the flu vaccine every year. But there is considerable doubt among scientists about how significant this particular mutation is for the COVID-19 pandemic. The Cell paper suggests this mutation allows the coronavirus to better bind and more easily enter human cells."There is zero evidence for this," says Vincent Racaniello, a virologist at Columbia University, who has written about why the Cell paper does not provide evidence for increased human transmission with this SARS-CoV-2 mutant. For one, the Cell study conducted its lab experiments with a “pseudotyped” virus, meaning the researchers did not use the real SARS-CoV-2 virus. To show that the mutation increases transmissibility, you would need to observe how the actual mutant behaves in people.“There is a huge gap between infectiousness in a lab and human transmission,” says Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist and virologist at Yale University. In the real world, he explains a virus has to make its way into the lungs—past mucus and the immune cells that line the airway. Then it has to replicate itself, and survive in droplets that are released back into the air. The takeaway outlined by the Cell study is plausible, Grubaugh says, but “there are so many other variables.”So, how concerned should we be about coronavirus mutations? National Geographic asked leading virologists and physicians.The authors of the Cell study, led by biologist Bette Korber of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, cut and pasted the coronavirus’s spike protein—either the mutant version, called G614, or the original—onto a completely unrelated germ called a lentivirus.The resulting “pseudoviruses” are a safe and reproducible way to work with and compare different viral spikes, Korber explains.The team then mixed these pseudoviruses in test tubes with different types of kidney cells. One batch was extracted 60 years ago from Vervet monkeys, while the others were picked from humans in 1973. These cells have also been immortalized, akin to the famous tale of Henrietta Lacks. This means they have been modified either naturally or artificially to live forever—unlike the cells found inside a human body. Likewise, the human cells used in Korber’s study were also genetically altered to be more easily infected by any virus carrying the spike protein.In this artificial, lab-based scenario, the researchers found the mutated spike to be more infectious. Coupled with the fact that the G614 mutation had risen to dominance in a matter of months, it sounded like an already scary virus might be getting better at jumping from person to person. Media reports exploded.But what do the results mean for people at this point?“We have no idea,” Racaniello says. While pseudovirus experiments are common practice in virology, they’re a bit like putting tiger teeth into the mouth of a koala. The mutant koala's bite might hurt more, but the experiment doesn’t tell you much about the ferociousness of koala bears or tigers outside the lab.Korber acknowledges the limitations of the experimental results: “We do not know” how they will translate into transmissibility in humans, she says, but “that is currently being explored in several laboratories.”Meanwhile, there’s an alternative explanation for why the mutant virus was able to rip across the population and dominate the outbreak—one that has little do with the G614 mutation itself.Viruses can mutate while they replicate—each cycle represents a roll of the genetic dice. Many of those mutations may confer no advantage but will nonetheless be passed along until they are common in the population. This is called the “founder effect.”The G614 mutation was first spotted in China in January 2020—just as the novel coronavirus was hopping into Europe. That suggests its global dominance may be due simply to seeding the early days of Europe’s outbreak, which then precipitated its spread to much of the Western Hemisphere. Indeed, when the University College London Genetics Institute took this founder’s effect into account in a recent analysis of coronavirus genomes collected from 23,000 patients worldwide, it found no evidence for increased transmissibility of any current mutations in SARS-CoV-2, including G614.Although Korber acknowledges the possibility of the founder effect, she thinks the sheer prevalence of G614 around the globe suggests that the mutation confers a fitness advantage—and in her view the evidence suggests that it is outcompeting its ancestral strain. “Almost every single time, out of the dozens and dozens of times when both forms were co-circulating in a region, the virus shifted to higher frequencies of the [G614] form,” she says.But a separate group of researchers, called the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium, is tracking the G614 mutation among British patients and has analyzed more than 30,000 viral genomes so far. While the G614 mutation “may possibly increase the rate of transmission between people, the difference we see is much less than the difference in cell infectivity measured in the laboratory,” Erik Volz, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and member of the consortium, said in a statement.The consortium also found no evidence that G614 is making coronavirus infections more severe or more lethal, a pattern that was also reported by Korber’s group and by scientists in Washington State.Although it is theoretically possible that a virus will hit the genetic jackpot and morph into something far deadlier and easier to spread, mutations that result in “X-Men-type changes” are also extremely unlikely, says Tyler Starr, virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.A far more likely outcome, says Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research at La Jolla, California is that “the virus will keep mutating and most of these won't do anything—some of them will be slightly detrimental to its fitness, some of them slightly beneficial, which is all expected.”To anyone who remembers the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in Africa, the current conversation about G614 has a familiar ring. At the time, some experts floated the terrifying possibility that the Ebola virus, which killed roughly 50 percent of its victims but was transmitted only through bodily fluids, could morph into an airborne disease.Early research three months into the outbreak showed the Ebola virus had acquired mutations similar to those now seen in SARS-CoV-2—a single amino acid change on its surface that made it better suited to infect cells in pseudovirus lab experiments.But, in the end, Ebola didn’t go airborne. The outbreak was contained through good public health measures and medical care. (Here's how to stop the coronavirus from winning.)The experts interviewed for this story said public concerns of mutations emerge with almost every pandemic. It could be because of fear of what’s unknown about this dangerous disease or simply because hazardous mutations make for a good story."With COVID-19 there are so many unknowns, and we can't tell a complete story. But as humans, we seek that complete story, and so we fill the gap,” says Seema Yasmin, director of research and education at the Stanford Health Communication Initiative. “Oftentimes we fill in the gaps with very sensationalist, very emotionally triggering information."Raising the specter of a deadly mutation “is a wonderful thing to say to rev up interest, because it’s like a science fiction TV plot,” says Howard Markel, a physician and medical historian at the University of Michigan. “You'll see in popular accounts of influenza, for example, in magazine articles, that the 1918 flu mutated and became stronger. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that.”A mutation that completely changes how the coronavirus behaves is unlikely. Both the flu and coronavirus are RNA viruses, and Racaniello points to other examples in this class—like HIV and measles—that have not fundamentally shifted their transmission behavior since they emerged.“There's no precedent for any virus changing its fundamental way of transmitting,” Racaniello says.More plausible, in the case of COVID-19, are slight mutations that render the virus suddenly unrecognizable to the immune system. In this scenario, people could be re-infected and vaccines—once developed—could be rendered useless over time. This is what happens with the seasonal flu. Every year, the virus changes slightly and we have to adjust our vaccines accordingly.SARS-CoV-2 was already quite adept at spreading when it emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. It’s mode of transmission—through respiratory droplets and in sometimes asymptomatic people—was already sufficient to cause a devastating pandemic.The future of the pandemic, experts say, will depend more on the actions we take to prevent the virus from spreading than on the intrinsic properties of the virus itself.Claus Wilke, structural biologist at University of Texas Austin, thinks the worries over the G614 mutation are missing that point: “It’s not going to affect the two main questions that we have, which are, how can we prevent spread? And will a vaccine work?”",
"Look in any biomedical laboratory, and you will find HeLa cells. Over 50 million tonnes of these cells have been grown in churning vats of liquid all over the world. They have been one of the most important tools in modern medicine, pushing forward our understanding of cancer and other diseases, and underpinning the polio vaccine, IVF, cloning, and more. None of these advanced would have been feasible without HeLa. Most scientists have used or seen them but most have no idea about their origin. It’s time to find out.In early 1951, there was only one place in the world where HeLa cells could be found – the cervix of a poor, black tobacco farmer called Henrietta Lacks. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital where, without her knowledge or consent, doctors took some cells from her tumour and cultured them. They became HeLa – the immortal line of cells that would change the world. Henrietta died in the same year. Her family only learned of her “immortality” more than 20 years later, when scientists started using them in research, again without informed consent, to better understand Henrietta’s cells. The cells launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials but her family cannot afford health insurance.The remarkably story of Henrietta’s life, cells and family are now coming to light, narrated in an equally remarkable book – Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Skloot is a veteran science journalist and first-time author and her debut is thrilling and original non-fiction that refuses to be shoehorned into anything as trivial as a genre. It is equal parts popular science, historical biography and detective novel. It reads as evocatively as any work of fiction, with dialogue, characters and settings vividly reconstructed from archived material, legal documents and thousands of hours of interviews. Like a mystery, the chronology flits back and forth from the first and last days of Henrietta’s life, the decades of discovery that followed her death and Skloot’s own modern-day quest to uncover the story.Indeed, Skloot repeatedly appears as a character in her own book, narrating her journey from first hearing about HeLa cells in a classroom to her attempts to contact and support the Lacks family. This literary device could easily have come across as self-aggrandising but Skloot fully earns her status as the story’s third protagonist. Her narration reveals the trials that the Lacks family have undergone since Henrietta’s cells went global, and the sheer amount of trust it took to uncover the details of this story.I did, indeed, say “third protagonist”. This is really a book about three heroines – the two whose names grace the cover and Henrietta’s daughter, Deborah Lacks. Skloot’s personal mission to tell this story and Deborah’s quest to know about her mother’s life and legacy are central parts of Henrietta’s story and they form some of the book’s most compelling segments.I write this review as someone who isn’t typically a fan of historical non-fiction. Particularly in popular science, I often find descriptions of researchers to be distracting attempts at shoehorning in a human element that is out of keeping with the rest of the book. Not so here – this work has the most human of stories at its core, and never deviates from that important, and often heartbreaking, humanity. When science appears, it does so effortlessly, with explanations of cell anatomy or techniques like “fluorescence in situ hybridization” seamlessly worked into descriptions of the coloured wards of Johns Hopkins hospital to Lacks’s hometown of Clover, Virginia.Skloot’s prose is witty, lyrical, economical and authoritative. But The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is not a comfortable read. I visibly winced at descriptions of Henrietta’s blackened, burned skin after multiple rounds of devastating radiation treatments. I put the book down with a heavy sigh after reading about the experiments that black Americans have been unwittingly subjected to over the years. I cried twice, at events that I can’t talk about without seriously spoiling the book. But it is uplifting too, particularly in a stand-out chapter where Henrietta’s children, Deborah and Zakariyya, visit a cancer researcher to see their mother’s cells under a microscope.All of this is to be expected of a book that refuses to shy away from tackling important themes – the interplay between science and ethics, the question of who owns our bodies, and the history of racism in the US. And yet for all its grand scope, skilful writing and touching compassion, there is one simple element that makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks an instant classic – this is one of those stories that genuinely needed to be told.Uncovering it was a decade-long labour of love for Skloot and every year of research is apparent in its brisk 300-page length. It’s a tribute to the art of investigative journalism and it sets an incredibly high benchmark for future non-fiction writing. As a young science writer starting out in this field, this book will provide inspiration for years to come.As a final thought, I was struck by the parallels between Henrietta’s cells and her story. Henrietta’s entire family history was eventually condensed into a small sliver of cells that you could carry in a glass vial. They have achieved immortality, used by scientists throughout the world. Similarly, her entire life has been condensed into a moving tale and an exceptional book that you could read in a comfortable day. By right, it will achieve the same immortal status.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks launches on February 2, 2010 and is currently available to pre-order on Amazon (UK or US site). I urge you to do so – pre-ordering will help to determine the book’s fate in the first few weeks of sale, when much of its future is set.",
"Humans can beat COVID-19 because viruses are simplistic. They can’t move anywhere without assistance. Leave them outside in the open air for very long, and many will disintegrate. All they know is how to multiply. The problem, of course, is that the coronavirus is adept at this singular task, and as countries such as the United States have tried to loosen lockdowns and other restrictions, they’ve been jarred by the pandemic’s latest swells.After months of plateauing at 20,000 to 30,000 new cases per day nationwide, U.S. numbers are rising sharply in 30 states, and overrun medical centers are scrambling to free up beds. In Houston, Texas, where daily cases have surged from 300 to 1,300 in two weeks, health-care workers are moving adult patients to children’s hospitals in a desperate bid to keep up with the surges. Other states are facing similar challenges.“We are quickly reaching that critical level of capacity in ICU beds and ventilators in hospitals in the worst-hit areas,” says Purnima Madhivanan, an infectious disease epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “Right now, I think the only thing we can think about is at least starting with harm reduction.”Harm reduction refers to public health tools and practices—such as needle exchange programs or safe sex with condoms—meant to lessen danger rather than expecting universal compliance to rigid guidance. This approach acknowledges that risk levels vary by person and setting, and solutions should be tailored for those individual scenarios.With the coronavirus, harm reduction techniques include convincing people to wear masks for the riskiest scenarios, such as crowded spaces, but relaxing those guidelines in places where people can stay at safe distances, such as parks. These approaches can go beyond decisions made by individuals, and the principles have already guided some nations and states, including New Zealand, South Korea, and New York State, toward successfully beating back the coronavirus.“We were stuck, maybe six weeks ago, in this false binary between staying at home indefinitely and going back to business as usual,” says Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts who has pushed for expanding harm reduction during this crisis. “Risk isn't binary, and we can't expect people to stay home forever, to abstain from social contact forever.”More than half a dozen epidemiologists, virologists, and psychologists contacted by National Geographic agree, and said that struggling governments can win their COVID-19 wars—and perhaps avoid further lockdowns—through more unified planning and messaging, steeped with harm reduction. They say much of America’s inabilities to waylay COVID-19 stem from humans ignoring our essential advantages over the virus: communication, cooperation, and compromise.“The countries that have succeeded have been the ones that have had real political and public will unite,” says Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, whose lab is modeling hospital burden during the crisis. None of these experts believe the COVID-19 war is lost, but government leaders, news media, scientists, and the general public need to shift their mindsets and messaging, because if the virus is victorious, the devastation will be several times worse than what we’re seeing now.On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it believed 5 to 8 percent of the U.S. population—roughly 26 million people—has already been infected with the coronavirus. Though CDC chief Robert Redfield didn’t provide data, his claim mirrors what similar surveys have revealed: Outside of New York City, the hardest-hit epicenter on the planet, total infections are still relatively low. Even assuming that every infection mentioned by Redfield creates lasting immunity—which isn’t necessarily the case—exposure to the virus would need to expand tenfold in most parts of the U.S. to establish herd immunity. (Read why the U.K. backed off on achieving herd immunity through infection alone.)In other words, the virus still has abundant room to keep spreading. But harm reduction can help stop that from happening. Here’s how.Since the beginning of its outbreak, the U.S. has relied on two options: mitigation via draconian stay-at-home orders, and containment of the virus’s spread via testing, self-isolation, and contact tracing. This dual strategy is a bit like using either a chainsaw or a scalpel to build Ikea furniture. It isn’t flexible enough to adapt to the ever-surprising coronavirus, and it’s easily derailed by misinformation.For one, governors and news outlets have repeatedly cited adults under 50 as the main cause of the newest surges in COVID-19 cases. But young adults have made up about 25 percent of COVID-19 hospitalizations in U.S. surveys every week since early March, suggesting their infection rates haven’t ballooned tremendously. In Texas, one of the fastest growing hot spots, the share of infections among young adults was 50 percent before stay-at-home orders began lifting on May 1, and it has only grown by 3 percentage points since then. Likewise in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and Arizona’s COVID-19 epicenter, the share of cases among young adults has increased only 15 percent.“When you look at all of the pieces, it kind of makes sense that that's the age group that will have the highest rates,” Madhivanan says, given the U.S. workforce skews younger. “Infection rates at the beginning of any outbreak are always concentrated in younger, more active age groups with higher social contact rates...They're the essential workers. They are the working class...They are the ones required to be physically at their jobs.”Yet simultaneously, public messaging tends to tell younger groups that they’ll be spared from COVID-19 symptoms and its worst outcomes, which isn’t quite right. No rigorous studies support the claim that younger people are more likely to be asymptomatic. On June 25, the CDC expanded its list of people at risk of severe COVID-19 to include all adults—rather than just those over 65—with the caveat that risk increases with age. And while deaths are more common among the elderly, clinical reports from hard-hit places such as New York City and China show people under age 50 often suffer serious consequences from COVID-19 and remain hospitalized for as long as members of older generations.Young people have always been a part of this crisis, but conveying their risks and roles in this pandemic is difficult, which has bred confusion.“What they need to appreciate is that they are part of a process of the dynamics of an outbreak,” Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 23 when asked about how to get younger adults to comply. “Getting back to normality is going to be a gradual step-by-step process and not throwing caution to the wind.”The problem is getting the message just right, because mixed signals can harm people’s abilities to adhere to public health advice. Research shows that conflicting messages can cause mental hardship, and in the absence of credible and consistent information, people often hear what they want to hear and become prone to seeking misinformation.“When there's an absence of consistent messaging from authorities, many rumors and conspiracy theories can fill the void, and that makes it very difficult for people to figure out what it is that they should do,” says Roxane Cohen Silver, a UC Irvine professor of psychological science.Her lab has shown how relentless news cycles that focus too heavily on the negatives, such as those around the 2014 Ebola crisis or mass shootings, can collectively traumatize the public and even elicit symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Though more research is needed, such signs are emerging with COVID-19, including with “doomscrolling,” the binging of worrisome media posts. Cohen Silver’s team warned in May that both the media and health experts have a role to play in delivering practical advice about the pandemic’s risks without amplifying hysteria and confusion.“I would encourage people to monitor the amount of time that they're engaged with the media to make sure that they're checking trustworthy authoritative sources,” Cohen Silver says.Testing is one arena where a clear message could help, but it has taken time to find the right path for the U.S. Early flaws with the CDC’s COVID-19 kit caused the country to fall behind on diagnosing new cases, the equivalent of trying to end a fire without water. This spring, one report from well-regarded researchers assembled by the Rockefeller Foundation called for “a dramatic expansion” from one million tests per week to three million tests per week over the course of two months. Combine this testing of roughly one percent of the U.S. population with “high-precision” contact tracing, and the foundation predicted that parts of the economy could restart.However, that approach would require 70 percent of contacts complying with quarantine, says Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who wasn’t part of the report. If the epidemic grows too big, contact tracing can’t be successful, and without adequate contact tracing, the Rockefeller report says the nation would need to reach 30 million tests per week to control COVID-19 without a vaccine. The report dubbed it the “1-3-30 plan.”According to the COVID Tracking Project, the U.S. crossed the three million mark in early June, after hovering near the tally since mid-May. And yet, cases are surging again. What went wrong?“Yeah, we have had far too much testing, testing, testing mantra without really understanding what that accomplishes,” says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota and a coauthor of the 1-3-30 plan. “We need to put less emphasis on the number of tests that are conducted in a given region, and ask ourselves what tests are needed.”Here’s where harm reduction can come into play again. Even the best diagnostic tests run the risk of yielding a false positive result, so if a city, state, or nation tests too many random people in the general public, you might end up quarantining the wrong people. Rather than test blindly, the highest priorities should be seeking out individuals who have symptoms of possible COVID-19 disease as quickly as possible and processing their tests faster, so the right cases can enter quarantine sooner. That’s how places like New York, South Korea, and the European Union beat back their outbreaks.“I am deeply worried about approaches that assume we are going to test people who either have no symptoms or no epidemiologic criteria for testing,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist who leads the Johns Hopkins Testing Insights Initiative at the Center for Health Security.Nuzzo wants more than three million tests per week to root out COVID-19 from the most at-risk populations, such as by instituting universal and regular testing at nursing homes, prisons, and jails. But 30 million tests per week would be impractical, she says, because there are only so many labs in the country that can process the samples.“To me, if we have to do that level of testing, it represents a bit of a failure … because that will mean that we have let the epidemic grow to the point where it's just wildly uncontained,” she says.The better benchmark for monitoring progress, she says, is test positivity, or what percentage of tests come back positive. The World Health Organization recommends that before places reopen, they need to record a test positivity percentage below 5 percent for at least 14 straight days, as many countries with subsiding outbreaks have done. When places go above this line, it becomes harder to keep COVID-19 from hopping from group to group. Too much positivity can also mean an outbreak is expanding uncontrollably, and because medical centers tend to prioritize patients with the most serious symptoms, more of the milder cases will go unnoticed, worsening the spread.But rather than follow the World Health Organization’s benchmark, which was decided by an international panel of top experts, the CDC and the White House said that states can start reopening after falling below 20 percent test positivity. “It's outrageously high,” Nuzzo says. Of the 30 states with cases surging right now, 16 have test positivity rates above 5 percent, and others in this unfortunate group are trending upward too.The world has made huge strides in understanding the coronavirus, but these conclusions take time. Scientists went from being unsure about face masks to fully supporting them in a few months. Their mindsets are also shifting on a “second wave”—a concept originally borrowed from the history of influenza pandemics. From an epidemiological perspective, true waves will dissipate on their own without much human intervention, but the coronavirus is not following that traditional pattern.“I don't see this as a wave anymore. Waves are outdated. We have peaks and valleys,” says Osterholm, whose center laid out these scenarios in April.Such observations have yielded evidence-based interventions that can restrict the coronavirus to low levels, buying time for the development of a vaccine or the other remedies needed to wrangle COVID-19. Yet, flaws in messaging are threatening this progress. Few people noticed two weeks ago when the CDC released thorough guidelines on dining out, because the public health agency has largely disappeared from public view. Mask hesitancy has also crept into the public conversation due to political divides.“The bottom line is it really is about leadership,” says Aileen Marty, a professor at Florida International University who has served as an infectious disease advisor on the local, national, and international levels. All of the experts interviewed for this story agreed on this point, but also said responsibility lands not only at the very top with the White House, but also on Congress and its control of health agency funds and veto overrides, governors and their abilities to coordinate counties and cities, and everyone else down the ladder.None of the experts believe a second lockdown is inevitable, but the U.S. has returned to the dangerous prospect of overwhelming hospitals, which prevents routine services from going forward. Much of the COVID-19 relief aid expires in July, and our return to enclosed environments where the disease thrives is beckoning as summer creeps toward autumn.“The reality is the virus doesn't care,” Shaman says. “It's just going to do what it does..”",
"Medical workers take nose and mouth swabs, each collected in less than a minute, at a walk-in clinic at H Plus Yangji Hospital in Seoul, April 14, 2020. The walk-in clinic is set up like phone booths to prevent contact between patients and medical staff. Since opening this type of testing site on March 10, the hospital has screened 2,700 patients and identified 4 confirmed cases, as of April 22. A test result can be returned within 4 to 6 hours.Seoul, South KoreaThe COVID-19 testing center at H Plus Yangji Hospital in southern Seoul doesn't look like much from the outside. Resembling a mobile home, the temporary building sits in a parking lot near a loading ramp, propped up on one end by a wooden plank. Its walls are wrapped in red and white, and billboard-like signage proclaims that the hospital was named one of the 100 best in the Republic of Korea.But inside is a gleaming bank of four booths with transparent plastic walls; rubber gloves embedded through them in a manner similar to a high-grade biosafety lab. When a person walks into a booth, they consult over an intercom with a doctor who remains outside. The doctor can swab their nose and throat using the gloves without ever coming into contact with the patient. The booths maintain negative air pressure, which sucks in any virus-carrying airborne droplets. After the test, a staff member in protective gear disinfects the booth, scrubbing the walls with a squeegee.Individuals arriving from overseas receive mandatory testing for COVID-19 at Eunpyeong District Health Center in Seoul, South Korea, May 2, 2020. These community health centers have been the very frontline of testing and detection in South Korea’s battle against the coronavirus.Hundreds of similar "walk-in" testing booths located all over the country have been one of the pillars of South Korea's highly successful strategy to contain COVID-19, helping officials roll out rapid and extensive diagnostic testing.The nation of 51 million people has also taken a big data approach to contact tracing, using credit card history and location data from cell phone carriers to retrace the movements of infected people. Surveys show most Korean citizens are OK with sacrificing digital privacy to stop an outbreak. At the same time, authorities have pushed an intense—but mostly voluntary—social distancing campaign, leaving most bars, restaurants, and movie theaters free to operate.The viral scourge is far from over in South Korea—a recent outbreak connected to several nightclubs was reported with 102 cases as of May 12. Despite this, the country’s response could serve as a model for the rest of the world, but achieving this level of speedy success in the face of a pandemic was not easy.Jo An-na, 35, and Seong Geum-ran, 33, put on Level-C protection at the ICU nurses’ station at the National Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, April 14, 2020.Nurses at the Seoul Medical Center rarely take their eyes off the isolation ward's monitors even while eating on April 3, 2020.A major factor shaping South Korea's response was its ability to apply lessons learned during previous outbreaks, especially the country’s MERS coronavirus outbreak in 2015, which resulted in 186 cases and 38 deaths.In the immediate aftermath, South Korea's legislature created the legal foundation for a comprehensive strategy for contact tracing—whereby anyone who has interacted with an infected person is traced and placed in quarantine. Amendments explicitly authorized health authorities to request patients' transaction history from credit card companies and location data from cell phone carriers—and to release the reconstructed movements in the form of anonymous "travel logs" so people could learn the times and places where they might have been exposed.A huge push with contact tracing and testing managed to corral an early rise in cases that threatened to spiral out of control—hundreds were reported each day, peaking at 909 cases on February 29 with most associated with a religious sect in the city of Daegu. The strategy also managed to snuff out several subsequent coronavirus clusters at churches, computer gaming cafes, and a call center. By April 15, South Korea safely held a national election, in which 29 million people participated. Voters wore masks and gloves; polling centers took everyone's temperature and separated anyone with a fever. No cases have been traced to the election.A lab technician divides reagents at TCM Biosciences, a company developing COVID-19 testing kits in Pagyo, April 22, 2020. Aggressive testing, contact tracing, and quarantines have been key to South Korea's success in the battle against the coronavirus. Samples are analyzed using real-time PCR, and test results arrive within 4 to 6 hours.While people in other countries may consider Korea’s data collection a violation of patient privacy, the measures have broad support from the South Korean public. In a March 4 poll led by the Seoul National University Graduate School of Public Health, 78 percent of 1,000 respondents agreed that human rights protections should be eased to strengthen virus containment efforts. Experience with past outbreaks also meant people were quick to stay at home and wear masks in public even before the government began issuing formal guidelines.Crucially, South Korea had built up its diagnostic testing capabilities after the 2015 MERS outbreak. Unlike the U.S., which relied on testing kits developed by its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, South Korea enlisted the private sector. At a meeting in late January, officials urged local biotech companies to develop testing kits. Within a month, the nation was running more than 10,000 tests daily.A recent boom in South Korea's biotech scene, long predating the pandemic, helped with the ramp-up, says Thomas Shin, the CEO of TCM Biosciences, a company in Pangyo, south of Seoul. "During the last five years, there were many new bioscience companies," says Shin. TCM was one of the companies that heeded the government's call to develop kits, and it received approval from the country’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in April.Shin says the decision wasn't necessarily an easy one from a business perspective—new diseases are difficult to forecast, and if they're snuffed out quickly, it can be hard to recoup the costs of initial development. But with South Korea’s close connections to the outbreak’s epicenter in China, Shin says TCM could see a similar situation developing rapidly on the home front—and projected a business opportunity in the global market. So far, the company has shipped kits worth roughly $2.6 million.Following the advice from the South Korean government, public and private institutions introduced exams that adhere to social distancing. On Saturday, April 25, the Korea Life Insurance Association and the General Insurance Association of Korea conducted a qualification exam for insurance sales agents outdoors. It was a windy day, but more than 18,000 people sat for the exam across Korea. Test takers were happy that the exams resumed after a hiatus of more than two months.At the peak of South Korea's COVID-19 outbreak, the government advised against all religious gatherings. As the country's daily number of new infections has dropped below a dozen, social distancing restrictions have been gradually eased. On April 23, just a week before Buddha's Birthday, a large number of buddhist devotees gathered at Jogyesa Temple in downtown Seoul to pray.Locals line up to get their photos taken in front of a tulip field at Seoul Forest Park on Sunday, April 26. Social distancing restrictions have loosened, and life seems to be getting back to normal. Mask wearing and frequent hand washing have become the new norms.On April 30, the nation reported just four cases, all of them travelers arriving from abroad, marking the first day with zero local infections in two and a half months. As case numbers have continued to fall, the government has cautiously relaxed its guidelines, while signaling a shift to "everyday quarantine" measures, such as wearing masks and temperature checks at schools.People's attitudes have also relaxed, leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections. The nightclub outbreak may heighten those fears, but the government has already responded aggressively, tracing and testing thousands of people in a matter of days.Though testing companies were quick to respond to the demand, rolling out the kits presented difficulties. Through February, demand for tests was still outpacing supply, and there were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals.Furthermore, hospitals struggled to administer the tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly—testing areas needed to be sanitized after each patient, long queues meant the virus could spread while people waited in line, and health workers were running low on protective gear. At Yangji Hospital, this also led to exhausted staff, says hospital director Sang Il Kim."Even when we did have kits, the waiting times were just too long for everybody to get tested, so they would have to go to other hospitals," adds Yoona Chung, a doctor in the hospital's surgery department.According to Yangji's data, the hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February—but many more were being turned away due to the wait. Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive-through testing centers, where patients could get tested without leaving their cars. But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighborhood in southern Seoul; for many of its patients, cars aren't an option.So, Kim devised the walk-in booths, which went into pilot operation on March 10. Within days, the number of tests administered in a day had tripled. By the end of the month, the hospital could handle more than 90 patients a day. Hospitals elsewhere in Korea and around the world quickly adopted their own variations on the concept. A hospital in Busan had a similar idea independently but others have had help from Kim.A Korean BBQ joint in Seoul is bustling with locals on on Sunday, April 26. They are enjoying themselves after two months of voluntary quarantine and social distancing.At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, hospital leadership saw news reports on Yangji's booths and asked an in-house team to create a version, hoping to better protect their health workers and conserve precious protective gear. A bit of Googling and two phone calls later, hospital staff connected her with Kim via email."I remember it was 10 p.m., we're all frustrated, up all night, trying to figure out how to make this work," says Nour Al-Sultan, a business strategy analyst at the MGH Springboard Studio, the team of researchers and designers tasked with reverse engineering the booths. “I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning, and Dr. Kim is the one who answers all of my questions."MGH has now installed about eight booths at three hospitals in the Boston region. According to preliminary data, they've reduced the need for protective gowns, which are in short supply, by 96 percent, saving more than 500 gowns a week. The MGH team is now working with colleagues in Uganda to help them develop their own versions of the booths.“The fact that he took the time to provide me with such generous insights is just a testament to this spirit of global collaboration against the pandemic," Al-Sultan says.",
"A staff member from the London Underground wears a protective face mask while passengers board the train on March 3, 2020.While countries around the world began to lock down workplaces, schools, and public gatherings in response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, the United Kingdom’s initial strategy sent many into an uproar.At first, the U.K. chose not to shut down large gatherings or introduce stringent social distancing measures. In a plan that surprised many in the medical community, officials instead described a plan to suppress the virus through gradual restrictions, rather than trying to stamp it out entirely.The strategy, an attempt to build “herd immunity,” involved allowing “enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune,” Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government’s chief scientific adviser, told Sky News on March 13.If the risks of COVID-19 were not so high, it would technically be possible to bring about herd immunity by allowing the disease to run rampant through a population. However, evidence shows that scenario would lead to high rates of hospitalization and need for critical care, straining health service capacity past the breaking point.After new simulations of the outbreak from Imperial College London showed how badly hospitals would be overwhelmed, the U.K. suddenly reversed course on Monday and introduced new social distancing measures. By Friday, the Prime Minister had ordered all pubs, restaurants, gyms, and cinemas to close.Still, the question of herd immunity’s role in slowing the coronavirus lingers because of how it might determine the success of vaccine development—and the chances that the virus may flare back up once social distancing policies end.Viruses are stealthy. They disguise themselves as they infect a host and penetrate that host’s cells, which gives them a head start over the body’s immune response. Once a cell recognizes certain telltale signs of a pathogen, it throws out an alarm signal to the immune system. But because the virus has that head start, it still has time to replicate itself and infect a new host before the immune system can catch up.Immune responses within a cell can take around 24 hours to trigger, says Elly Gaunt, a virologist at the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute. A full-blown immune response can take another three days—which means that a respiratory virus like the flu, which can replicate in as little as eight hours, is way ahead of the game.That’s why someone’s first experience with an infectious disease can be so nasty. The immune system is not so easily tricked a second time: When it’s beaten an invader once, it keeps a specialized weapons cache dedicated to that particular pathogen, ready to mount a high-speed reaction if it’s ever detected again. So, the second time the disease shows up in your body, the virus won’t have that handy head start.People with immunity are “duds for transmission,” says Katie Gostic, a University of Chicago researcher who studies immunity to influenza. And when viral transmission can’t sustain itself an epidemic will slow down and end, she explains.Herd immunity can only be reached when a precise proportion of a community becomes resistant to an infectious disease, says Yonatan Grad, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. You can’t have just some herd immunity, he explains, in the same way you can’t be just a little bit pregnant.To have herd immunity, each infected person must, on average, infect less than one person (though clearly, it’s not possible to infect half a person; if some infected people pass on the infection and others don’t, the average transmission rate will be less than one.) Once the transmission rate drops below one, a community has herd immunity. That won’t stop each and every case, but it will prevent the disease from spreading indefinitely.Many of our lessons on herd immunity come from the measles, because it's so contagious. The more infectious a disease is, the more people who need to be immune to reach herd immunity. One person with measles, for instance, could infect up to 18 other people in a susceptible population. To get that transmission rate all the way down to less than one, almost everyone in the population needs to act as a buffer between an infected person and a new potential host. That’s why measles needs such a high rate of herd immunity—around 95 percent.Research so far suggests that the coronavirus has a lower infection rate than measles, with each infected person passing it on to two or three new people, on average. This means that herd immunity should be achieved when around 60 percent of the population becomes immune to COVID-19.Vaccines create a weapons cache for a disease without the body ever having to fight off the disease itself, which is why herd immunity is something that’s generally pursued through vaccination rather than infection. For example, about 30 percent of measles cases have complications such as seizures, pneumonia, and encephalitis, resulting in about two deaths for every thousand cases in the U.S. Exposing a whole population to measles would be a dangerous way to cultivate herd immunity among the survivors.But it’s not unheard of for herd immunity to emerge through disease transmission. The infamous “chicken pox party” is a way some parents have intentionally exposed their children to a disease that’s commonly less harmful in childhood than in adulthood.“The problem with coronavirus is that no-one has had it before, regardless of age,” says Gostic of the University of Chicago. It’s almost as if chicken pox had just emerged for the first time, leaving adults more susceptible to the more severe cases that come with age, she explains.Herd immunity also isn’t something that can work for any disease. It doesn’t matter how many people are vaccinated against tetanus, for example: If someone who isn’t vaccinated steps on a rusty nail, they can still get infected, because tetanus lives in reservoirs outside of the human body. An infection must be transmitted between people for herd immunity to have a protective effect.Immunity also doesn’t always last that long. HIV mutates so quickly that it can actually evolve within a single person, says Jessie Abbate, an infectious disease expert at the Research Institute for Development in France. Swiftly mutating flu is also a moving target for immunity and vaccines, which is why each flu season’s vaccine needs to anticipate the strain that will circulate widely, she explains.Four other coronaviruses already circulate among humans, says Gaunt, and they all cause the common cold, since we don’t stay immune to those viruses for very long. If the novel coronavirus is similar, that means that people would need to be repeatedly vaccinated or infected for herd immunity to be sustained.Some reports describe reinfections of the novel coronavirus in people who tested positive again after they had already recovered. It’s not clear, though, that these are actually cases of reinfection—it’s more likely that they can be explained by people continuing to shed the virus for a long time, and that the level of virus shedding fluctuates over time.Rapid reinfection is, for now, “an outside possibility,” Abbate agrees. If people were able to get sick again really quickly, we wouldn’t see the rapid decline in case numbers that is happening in certain parts of the world. And it would go against almost every other virus that we’ve known about, she says.Even if a successful vaccine is developed, there will always be a small proportion of people who are vaccinated but don’t develop immunity. And if immunity to this new coronavirus is short-lived and needs repeated vaccination, that would present some extra logistical challenges, Grad adds.In the meantime, the best policy for controlling the spread of the coronavirus is social distancing, which is why many medical professionals were relieved when the U.K. government rapidly changed its strategy."We were expecting herd immunity to build,” Azra Ghani, an infectious disease researcher at Imperial College London, said in a press briefing on March 16. “We now realize it’s not possible to cope with that.”",
"A contact tracer with Turkey's Health Ministry checks on a woman at her home in Istanbul. After her roommate tested positive, she began experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. The United States lags behind in efforts to trace the spread of the coronavirus. Experts say 180,000 contact tracers will be needed; now there are about 11,000 on the job.On August 3, 1900, a woman who sold fish along the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland, started vomiting and couldn't stop. Within days, she and a granddaughter who shared her tenement were dead. Soon, health officials would confirm their worst fears: “Mrs. B” had contracted Bubonic plague—the first outbreak in the United Kingdom in centuries.Authorities moved quickly. They reached out to anyone who’d had contact with the deceased. They tracked down a sick child most likely infected by a babysitter who’d attended the grandmother’s wake. They traced a factory worker’s illness to colleagues who’d visited the victims’ family. Health officials isolated at least a hundred people. They disinfected sheets and fumigated apartments. By the time they contained the outbreak, 35 people had died. It could have been far worse.Thanks to modern medicine, doctors today can perform surgery using robots and lasers. But our best shot at tracking the path of a contagion such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is still the same labor-intensive process used during the reign of Queen Victoria.The practice, called contact tracing, aims to identify those the virus might strike next. It’s an indispensable part of breaking the chain of a pathogen’s transmission and getting society back on track, according to most health officials including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But in the United States, the idiosyncrasies and scale of this pandemic—and the intense polarization of this peculiar moment in American history—promise to make contact tracing the most complex and difficult health investigation in history.Around the globe, health workers in many countries already have spent months painstakingly calling people to let them know they may have come in contact with someone carrying the virus. This army of tracers urges those who’ve been exposed to isolate themselves rather than risk sickening others. From South Korea to Singapore contact tracing has slowed, though not stopped, the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.The U.S., despite having more cases than any other nation, is only just getting started. And for tracing to work in freedom-loving America, a lot needs to change—and change now. At the end of April, a bipartisan group of health officials suggested the country would need 180,000 tracers to detect and trail the virus’s movement from now until we find a vaccine. In early May, a National Public Radio survey of the states found that there were about 11,000 tracers.Yet even as this workforce is ramping up, interviews with nearly two dozen experts suggests political tribalism, misinformation, the demonization of at-risk communities, and the lack of a cohesive federal response threaten to complicate the task. Tracing will only be successful if people trust public health officials, tell the truth, and respond by changing their behavior.“It’s going to be hard,” said Janet Baseman, an epidemiologist and associate dean at the University of Washington School of Public Health. “The virus is new, and it’s poorly understood, which increases people’s fear. It’s a divisive time in this country, and when we’re in a climate like that, how do you rally people around being part of our response?”We’re also perilously far behind. The number of new cases appearing each day is swinging wildly, from 13,000 on May 19 to 24,000 the next day, even though much of the country remains locked down. And those are just the cases we know about. Until the U.S. does a far better job of quickly figuring out who is infected, it simply won’t be possible to keep up with tracing.Right now, the country tests roughly 300,000 people daily. That’s a fraction of what health experts have said we’ll ultimately need; estimates include 900,000, 3 million, and 20 million. Many of those tests require days-long waits for results—delays that let the virus extend its reach. And the Trump Administration has insisted it is unlikely to get beyond more than 500,000 tests.A contact tracer reaches out to inform people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus in Paterson, New Jersey, which has become a pioneer in the effort to curb the spread of COVID-19.Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard University's School of Public Health, is pessimistic. Even if 80 percent of the country managed to trace cases effectively—“which would be miraculous,” he said—the remaining 20 percent would be a constant source of new infections. New research, not yet peer reviewed, suggests tracing would have to catch at least half of all new cases to reduce transmission even 10 percent. “My view is it’s probably not going to work,” Lipsitch said. “But given the lack of alternatives, we have to try—and hopefully demonstrate that I’m wrong.”His colleague, Ashish Jha with Harvard’s Global Health Institute, however, believes these problems are surmountable. To stand a chance, though, this campaign will have to move fast.Contact tracing is often characterized as sleuthing, but the job is more akin to social work. To trace contacts, investigators ask ill people or their next of kin about their whereabouts back to a few days before they showed symptoms, seeking anyone the victim had come within six feet of for at least 15 minutes. Those contacts are then passed to a tracer who reaches out by phone.This second round of conversations follows a vague script. Callers explain to people that they may have been exposed. They answer questions and ask about symptoms and access to care. They ask the exposed people if they have food and a bathroom. They urge them to isolate at home and call their doctors. Callers ask these people who they, in turn, might unwittingly have infected.Krysta Cass has made hundreds of such calls in the last two months as a tracer in Boston. “There’s a point in time where you want to pause and let them really digest what you said,” she explained. “You have to wait and listen, and then be a friend.” Her first task is to put people at ease.“The human component can’t be underestimated,” said Nahid Bhadelia, medical director at the special pathogen unit at Boston Medical Center and an associate professor of infectious diseases at Boston University’s School of Medicine. “You’re basically asking people to reveal parts of their lives to you.”This process can seem intrusive, but public health agencies have honed it over decades. They use tracing routinely for measles and food-poisoning outbreaks or to track HIV/AIDS and avian flu. It was central to stamping out Ebola in West Africa after the 2014 outbreak. “We get people to tell us who their public contacts are when they have syphilis,” said Kristen Pogreba-Brown, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Arizona. “We know how to do this.”Technology may help some this time around. Apple and Google and a half dozen other companies are developing cellphone applications that use GPS or Bluetooth technology. These apps can alert users that they were recently near an infectious person or allow them to retrace their steps to see if they crossed paths with a carrier. But most experts insist technology will merely support, not supplant, human tracing. And it may never be as effective in the U.S. as it has been in other countries.“The things people are trying to do passively, with phone apps, aren’t the same as active contact tracing,” says Eric Perakslis, a data science professor at Duke University who worked in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak. He has advised several states on COVID-19 tracing. “The Bluetooth stuff is proximity monitoring. It’s contact-tracing-like. It’s not the same as interviewing people … making sure they have food or medicine, asking if they need help. You’re not comparing apples to oranges. You’re not even comparing apples to pork chops.”For starters, tech solutions are valuable only if widely adopted, and polls show Americans are skeptical and worry that apps could infringe on data privacy. The U.S. also has so many cases that it can’t rely on weak crowdsourcing with limited penetration to find them all. Meanwhile, in much of Asia, previous viral outbreaks bred enough comfort and respect for tracing that there is less need for the handholding provided by human tracers. In a few countries, notably China, authoritarian governments also leave citizens little choice but to participate.Americans, on the other hand, are less sensitized to the need for tracing, more independent, and more suspicious of government monitoring. That brings its own complications.The whole point of tracing is to find people quickly, ideally within 48 hours, and get them to act to halt the pathogen’s spread. In the best of times, the job isn’t easy. Not everyone recalls every contact. Some people don’t answer their phones. Some can’t afford to stay home.And modern America is almost perfectly conditioned to accentuate these difficulties. The virus has hit minority communities hard. But after years of stepped-up immigration raids and racial demagoguing, many are reluctant to speak up.“There’s distrust, misinformation, a stigma, no united front,” says Rupa Narra, a pediatrician at New York University’s South Brooklyn campus who worked overseas for Doctors Without Borders and once worked as an epidemiologist for the CDC. She’s seen parents of sick kids in her hospital downplay their own symptoms even as she sees them coughing. “I think we’ve not done a great job reaching different parts of our population.”Talking heads on cable news and lawmakers in several states, including Louisiana and Minnesota, have demonized contact tracing. Washington state Rep. Jim Walsh, a Republican from Aberdeen, a city near the Pacific Coast, attacked tracing at a recent rally. “I’m very concerned about the rhetoric about ‘armies’ who are going to compel people to give up names of who they’ve been around,” he said later in an interview.Whether lawmakers fret about cost, consider tracing a barrier to states reopening, or view it as a cudgel to attack political adversaries, their criticisms have muddied efforts to develop public support. In mid-May, after complaints, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, rescinded plans to require restaurants upon reopening to have customers leave names and contact information. He wanted owners to be able to forward that data to tracers if there were an outbreak in their establishment. The state’s health department also issued a rare statement to bat down rumors that tracing could lead to forced quarantines. Tracing is voluntary.At the same time, a feature of public health—that most control is local—means the amount and priorities of tracing efforts will vary substantially from state to state. And privacy rules around health information generally prevent health districts from directly contacting individuals outside their state. That will likely prove cumbersome as states reopen and contact increases, especially as health authorities who are tracing cases race against the clock.“If I call Joe Schmoe, and he says, I had these five contacts, and this person was visiting from Florida, technically I can’t call the person in Florida,” Pogreba-Brown said. “I have to work through Florida’s health system.”So what do we do about that? The CDC should pull states together to improve data sharing and make sure contact tracing reaches the places that need it most. “This is clearly a national-level disaster that should be coordinated at the national level,” said Ben Brunjes, a University of Washington expert in emergency management and contracting.In lieu of a rigorous federal response, Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, is embedding expert teams in health districts around the country to build up tracing programs. It is providing advisers to offer technical assistance. In April, the group worked with Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker to rapidly hire 1,000 tracers. By mid-May these workers had reached 32,000 people. The nonprofit now plans to add 600 more tracers in Massachusetts.Meanwhile, Harvard’s Jha said testing is finally on the upswing. He has projected that the country needs 900,000 tests a day. He said logjams for ingredients like reagents to detect virus in samples can be loosened with a little cajoling. “I’ve talked to the companies,” he said.Testing also could rise by orders of magnitude if samples are pooled. Since the vast majority are negative, authorities could combine a dozen specimens into one batch and then only retest the individual specimens if the batch tests positive. “If you have 20 test kits, you could still test a hundred people,” Jha said. If testing let people find out more quickly if they’re carriers, it would make them more responsive to tracing and less likely to break self-imposed quarantines.To combat public wariness, experts say the U.S. needs a sustained campaign of accurate, apolitical information making clear that tracing is voluntary, confidential, and secure. Experts point to the Boston Public Health Commission, the nation’s oldest, which has spent decades making inroads with minority communities. Using a diverse staff that speaks eight languages, they’ve developed contacts that help navigate political barriers. “It’s about relationships,” said Thomas Lane, associate director of the commission’s Infectious Disease Bureau.Health districts should also try to develop contacts among protest movements and tracing skeptics, Jha said. The idea is that hearing from a tracer should be no more controversial than getting a concerned call from your doctor.In the meantime, Pogreba-Brown said, those who get sick should at least alert friends that they may have been exposed. “Getting a ping on your phone or a call from a stranger is very different,” she said, “from having your friend say, I feel like death, and you’ve been exposed, please take care of yourself.”",
"Amid the pandemic, once normal activities are now peppered with questions and concerns. Can kids go back to crowded schools? Is it safe to eat dinner with friends? Should we worry about going for a run?A recent modeling effort may help provide some clues. Led by Jose-Luis Jimenez at the University of Colorado Boulder, the charts below estimate the riskiness of different activities based on one potential route of coronavirus spread: itty-bitty particles known as aerosols. (Read more about what “airborne coronavirus” means and how to protect yourself).Coughing, singing, talking, or even breathing sends spittle flying in a range of sizes. The closer you are to the spewer, the greater the chance of exposure to large, virus-laden droplets that can be inhaled or land in your eyes.But many scientists have also grown concerned about the potential risks of aerosols—the smallest of these particles—which may float across rooms and cause infections. It’s a worry that's greatest where ventilation is poor and airborne particulates could build. While the World Health Organization recently acknowledged that aerosol transmission cannot be ruled out for some situations, they emphasized more research is needed to conclusively demonstrate its role in the spread of the virus.“We do not have a ton of information, but we cannot afford to wait for a ton of information,” Jimenez says.The new model incorporates what is known about the coronavirus's spread from case reports of potential airborne transmission, such as the Washington choir practice where one person was linked to dozens of other infections during a 2.5-hour rehearsal. It's further calibrated based on studies that attempt to untangle how much virus people emit while performing activities that involve exhalation. An important note: the model does not account for how the risk increases with closer proximity, where droplet and aerosol concentrations will be higher, or for people touching their eyes or noses with contaminated hands.To calculate the possible aerosol risks in various environments, users can tweak a host of parameters, such as the size of a group, the room size, or the effectiveness of masks.The model provides a rough estimation of risk, Jimenez cautions. (Of course, no model can explain exactly what will happen in reality.) Still, it can provide valuable clues to the relative risks of different activities. The risk also depends on the prevalence of the disease in your area, which users can input into the model to change the potential number of infected people in a given group.As with any model, the calculations must make some assumptions, such as requiring the air to be mixed, so the virus is dispersed throughout the room. (This is why the model does not account for close proximity with other people.) That's not always the case in the real world, but it is appropriate for many situations, says Shelly Miller, an expert in indoor air pollution at the University of Colorado Boulder, who led the modeling effort to characterize the potential aerosol spread during the Washington choir practice.The model underscores the importance of widespread use of masks and the risks of COVID-19 transmission in crowded rooms and poorly ventilated conditions—and in any of these settings, time is key, says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech who specializes in airborne transmission of viruses and provided feedback on the model. The longer anyone spends in a poorly ventilated or crowded space, the greater the predicted risk of falling ill.",
"To slow the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic, all street car riders were required to wear a mask in Seattle, Washington. Picture taken October 1918.Read this sentence aloud: With every passing word, an expanding blast of spittle spews from your mouth—the more emphatic the speech, the greater the spray.This mouth-made mist is the subject of a great debate about how the coronavirus hitches a ride from person to person. Virus-riddled globs can be inhaled, or even land in the eyes, potentially sparking infections in others. But for respiratory diseases like coronavirus, it’s long been thought these droplets are so large they will fall rapidly to the ground, inspiring public health recommendations such as cleaning surfaces and keeping six feet of social distance.Other scientists, however, have become increasingly concerned that the novel coronavirus spreads through a more insidious route—as an airborne pathogen. Every sneeze, cough, spoken word, or even exhaled breath expels droplets in a continuum of sizes. The worry is whether the tiniest—called aerosols—can harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus and allow it to linger or float across a room, causing new infections.In July, 239 scientists published a commentary in Clinical Infectious Diseases calling for the recognition of airborne transmission for COVID-19 based on a series of case reports and lab studies. Though debate remains over whether airborne coronavirus transmission happens outside of hospital settings, proponents say the public risks are too dire to wait for more research. They propose additions to health guidance, such as improving ventilation, and some are working on models to predict the hazards of this route of infection.One example involves a pair of methods that have been used for decades to track pollutants in indoor spaces and the risk of infectious disease. The model can calculate risk for multiple scenarios—including a classroom, campus, subway, bus, choir, demonstration, and outdoors—allowing users to tweak a variety of variables, including the amount of mask wearing, group size, and activity. The results can provide a valuable comparison of relative risk, says Jose-Luis Jimenez, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado Boulder who led the project. (Use this interactive model to measure the risk of airborne COVID-19 in your office, classroom, or bus ride.)But Jimenez and other proponents of aerosol transmission are still squaring off with the traditionalists who aren’t ready to abandon the view that the most worrisome route of coronavirus spread is through large respiratory droplets at close proximity. That classic view argues that aerosol transmission appears to be the exception rather than the rule. In response to the Clinical Infectious Diseases commentary, the World Health Organization acknowledged that airborne routes cannot be ruled out for some indoor incidents—but transmission through heavier droplets or contaminated surfaces could also explain these cases.National Geographic dives into the body of evidence with an array of scientists to determine what this debate means for you, and how we all should protect ourselves.Most scientists define aerosols as particles or liquid droplets that float through the air, while large droplets fall like projectiles. Some groups—including the WHO—draw a firm line with this spittle based on size. Aerosols are smaller than five to 10 microns, they say, and anything larger is considered a rapidly falling droplet. (Here’s what you need to know about public toilets and COVID-19.)However, proponents of airborne transmission argue that this division is hazy. For instance, a liquid drop five microns across can actually float for about half an hour. “Nature doesn’t create cutoff points,” says Lidia Morawska, an aerosol physicist at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia and an author of the Clinical Infectious Diseases letter.An intense sneeze can launch a high-speed cloud of spit—with droplets of all sizes—as far as 27 feet. The distance traveled depends on humidity levels, wafting currents, temperature, and static electricity. Differences in mass can also help explain why pollen, which is aerodynamically buoyant, can travel for miles despite being much larger than the wet aerosols made by your sneezes.For health-care workers, the simple division of airborne spread through aerosols versus transmission from larger droplets propelled through the air has had important implications for safety measures, says Daniel Diekema, the director of the infectious disease division of the University of Iowa Healthcare. "Airborne is reserved for a small list of organisms that we feel there’s transmission risk for anyone who shares the same air, even over long distances or long periods of time," he says.With these diseases, medical centers use extra precautions, such as placing patients in specially ventilated rooms and requiring health-care workers to wear N95 masks, which allow only 5 percent of inhaled aerosols through. That’s opposed to surgical masks, which are the baseline used in many hospitals. Surgical masks can allow anywhere from one to 76 percent of tiny particulates to pass, according to a study of masks cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (Cloth masks also have a wide range of effectiveness, as a recent study on a small group of people shows that some can filter out nearly as much as an N95, but bandanas and knitted fleece let most drops through.)Common medical procedures used with COVID-19 patients, such as mechanical ventilation, are also known to create higher concentrations of hazardous aerosols than talking or coughing. But if coronavirus is abundantly aerosolized outside of hospital settings, it would mean that surgical and cloth masks may not provide adequate protection when people spend extended periods in close proximity indoors. The prospect would also raise questions about social distancing guidelines, and whether public places that are poorly ventilated and without openable windows—such as some schools and offices—would need to upgrade HVAC systems to increase airflow with the outdoors, install additional filtration, or purchase portable air purifiers.Another concern is that airborne contaminants hold a certain aura of fear for the general public. "If you just say … this is an aerosol-transmitted virus, the connotation to people is that, Well, if I simply walk by a person on the street who is exhaling, I’m going to get sick," says Michael Klompas, a hospital epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "That, I think, is both an inaccurate and unduly fearsome kind of message."Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can't spread with this amount of ease, so when scientists say "airborne," it doesn't necessarily mean what most people think.One big question with airborne coronavirus is whether long periods of time in poorly ventilated rooms would allow aerosol levels to build. It’s similar to adding food coloring to a fish tank versus the ocean, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health. Just a few drops will disperse in both environments, but if you continue adding dye, only the fish tank will eventually shift its hue.Hints of this type of transmission have occurred with SARS-CoV-2. In a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, people sitting at three neighboring tables fell ill with COVID-19. Video records suggest that none of these people had direct contact with each other, and reconstructions conclude that a wallbound air conditioner may have aided transmission through the air. At a Buddhist temple in China, 24 of 67 worshippers caught the coronavirus while traveling on a bus with a sick colleague—a far greater infection rate than those who traveled in other vehicles to the event. Only one passenger sitting near the bus windows or door was infected, hinting that ventilation offered some protection.But in all of these case studies, aerosol transport did not happen over long distances, which bucks one of the classic conditions for airborne transmission. Chickenpox, for example, is thought to spread down long hallways or across windows of adjacent rooms. Measles can infect people for two hours after someone with the disease leaves a room.So if coronavirus is airborne, why doesn’t it behave like chickenpox or measles? Compared to most other respiratory diseases, measles is thought to require very little virus from one person to seed an infection in another, and people with measles likely spew enormous amounts.“Measles is the champion. It’s the Mohammad Ali of viruses,” says Jorge Salinas, hospital epidemiologist at the University of Iowa’s Carver College of Medicine.The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, on the other hand, may require inhaling a much higher dose to seed a new case. This may mean that coronavirus mist needs sufficient time to become more concentrated and therefore more hazardous—though a modeling study published on July 27 reported that few people with mild or moderate symptoms would produce a high enough amount of virus to pose a risk in poorly ventilated places if breathing normally. The risk increases with coughing.The biggest unknown is what happens indoors in what might be dubbed “the middle distance.” If the itty-bitty droplets build in the air, there might be risks beyond six feet, but infectious coronavirus doesn’t appear to be flying down long hallways.Rasmussen says the evidence presented in the relevant case studies strongly suggests some people catch the coronavirus without “getting a direct blast” of respiratory droplets from talking face-to-face.“But at what point does the number of virus-containing particles in the air exceed that threshold that you need to hit to get infected?” Rasmussen asks. “That’s really an open question.”That’s also why none of these studies can completely rule out classic transmission through respiratory droplets. One of the most widely-discussed examples of potential airborne coronavirus involves a 2.5-hour choir practice in Skagit County in Washington State. Singing, public health officials concluded, may have led to aerosol transmission of the coronavirus. But choir members also reported breaking into smaller groups where they sat next to each other, and some attendees shared snacks during a short break.“It’s really tricky to try to determine this in the real world,” Rasmussen says.It’s also unclear how long viable coronavirus virus lingers in the air. Laboratory experiments suggest at least three hours, but the WHO notes these aerosols were artificially generated and don't reflect natural human coughs. Infectious virus was successfully cultured from air samples collected up to 16 feet away from a patient with COVID-19 at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital, but the work has not yet undergone peer review.Untangling transmission has long posed a challenge for many diseases, says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech, who was part of the Clinical Infectious Diseases commentary. "Even for the flu, which we’ve studied for decades, we still don’t know how much is transmitted by aerosols or by touching contaminated objects," she says.Here is what’s clear: The coronavirus jumps between people in close proximity. Whether that happens because of aerosols, droplets, or some combination, most recommendations remain the same: Avoid crowds and face-to-face chats even while wearing a mask. Masks help stanch the spray, particularly for larger droplets, so people should still wear them, but the potential for aerosol transmission means more tactics may be needed for stuffy rooms.Enter the calls for better ventilation. On July 29, the WHO released a series of general recommendations on ventilation for public places and health facilities, which also cites guidelines for schools and businesses developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.Altering ventilation systems can have high cost, both financially and environmentally, but some shifts are simple and inexpensive. For example, classrooms could vacate for a period between classes, with windows and doors open to bring down airborne viral levels. Marr has also translated the concerns to actions in her daily life, such as winding down the windows in a taxi.The confusion surrounding the aerosol debate has underscored a need for better communication both between scientists in different fields and with the general public, says Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at the University of Arizona’s Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Instead of sparring over aerosols versus droplets, Popescu hopes scientists can find ways to convey relative risks of certains activities, and emphasize that greater precautions may be necessary in some situations, such as in indoor group gatherings."We've been using these terms for decades—perhaps we need a better communication approach," she says. "There’s so much riding on it, and we all just want to do the right thing."",
"Few people have the bladder fortitude to last through drinks, dinner, or long road trips without having to use the restroom. But as more restaurants, bars, and other public spaces start to re-open this summer, questions have been swirling around whether using a public toilet could become a more serious health risk in the era of COVID-19.Such worries came to a head this week when researchers in China published a study suggesting that flushing a toilet can create a plume of coronavirus-laden particles, which are flung into the air by the watery vortex inside a toilet bowl.Several studies using genetic tests have previously detected the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stool samples, and at least one investigation shows that the coronaviruses in these feces can be infectious. When a person infected with COVID-19 defecates, the germ at first settles into the toilet bowl. But then “the flushing process can lift the virus out of the toilet and cause cross-infection among people,” says Ji-Xiang Wang, a physicist at Yangzhou University in China and coauthor on the paper published June 16 in the journal Physics of Fluids.While the toilet plume effect has been studied for decades in relation to other diseases, many questions remain over its role in spreading germs, including the one that causes COVID-19. Neither the World Health Organization nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinks it’s very likely COVID-19 can be spread by bowel movements leading to accidental consumption of virus particles, a route medically termed fecal-oral transmission.Despite these uncertainties, experts say there are precautions you should take before answering nature’s call in publicly shared restrooms.For the latest study, Wang’s team used computer models to show that tiny droplets called aerosols, created by the turbulence of water sloshing inside a toilet bowl, could be ejected up to three feet into the air. Shortly after flushing, water rushes into the bowl, striking the opposite side with enough force to generate a vortex that forcefully pushes not only the liquid, but also the air inside the toilet.According to their simulations, this combination launches aerosols that can last in the air for just over a minute. The more water used in a toilet bowl, Wang’s team found, the greater the force of the flush.So what does that mean if you use a restroom after someone infected with COVID-19 flushes? That depends a lot on whether the infectious virus survives in human feces, and that’s still an active area of research.To start, studies of MERS, a coronavirus relative that flared up in 2012, indicate that this particular virus can survive in the human digestive tract, which is a sign the same might be true for SARS-CoV-2. Flu viruses and coronaviruses are considered “enveloped viruses” because they’re protected by a thin layer called a membrane. Unlike noroviruses, the most common culprit of food poisoning, enveloped viruses are easily degraded by acids, which make them vulnerable to the chemical make-ups of soap and stomach bile.One hypothesis, based on influenza research, suggests that these kinds of viruses might survive in the human gut if mucus from infected patients protects the germs during their journey through the digestive tract. The question then is how long the virus lasts in fecal matter, and that’s another area that needs more research, says E. Susan Amirian, a molecular epidemiologist at Rice University in Houston.“Fecal transmission is unlikely to be a major mode of transmission, even if it proves to be plausible,” Amirian says in an email. She notes that the CDC’s assessment of fecal-oral transmission cites one study in which scientists were able to detect only broken bits of the coronavirus’s genetic code in infected patients’ feces. These genetic snippets are an indicator the germ was once present in the body, but the virus has been degraded so much, it can no longer cause an infection.However, these broken viral bits appear quite often in COVID-19 defecations. Another study published in April found traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the fecal matter of more than half of 42 patients tested. And a May 18 report published by the CDC found viable and infectious SARS-CoV-2 in fecal excretions from a handful of patients.What’s more, past studies show that fecal-oral transmission may have occurred during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, another coronavirus cousin of COVID-19. Airborne fecal matter was thought to have exacerbated a cluster of 321 SARS cases at a Hong Kong apartment complex in 2003. Later examination of the incident found poor ventilation, contact with neighbors, and shared spaces such as elevators and stairwells also contributed to the event.“Using a public restroom, especially while taking precautions like maintaining physical distance from others and practicing good hand hygiene, is quite likely to be less risky than attending a gathering with people from other households,” Amirian says via email. She emphasizes that “the major mode of transmission for COVID-19 is person-to-person through respiratory droplets.”Still, “less risky” isn’t the same as no risk, and exactly how well the virus survives in feces, on surfaces, and in the air are questions scientists are still trying to answer.A study published last April in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the virus could live on steel and plastic surfaces for up to two and three days, respectively. A simple solution of soap and water can easily destroy the virus. But that means public restrooms can harbor COVID-19 germs if establishments don’t take care to wipe down surfaces.“At the end of the day, we need to remember that stool can be a reservoir for many diseases, and people sometimes don’t wash their hands as well as they think they do,” says Amirian. “Good hygiene, especially thorough hand washing, is important for reasons beyond COVID-19.”In public restrooms with multiple stalls that don’t limit the number of people allowed in, clusters of individuals represent an additional risk, as person-to-person contact is still the primary way people become infected with coronavirus.Joe Allen is the director of Harvard’s Healthy Buildings Program, where he researches how our offices, schools, and homes can influence our health. In investigations of buildings that adversely impact human health, Allen says, “I always remind people to check the exhaust in the bathroom.” He adds that improving ventilation that moves dirty indoor air outside is one of the best ways to safeguard against a contaminated restroom.“[Public] bathrooms should have exhaust fans that are constantly running,” Allen says.If possible, he also recommends that establishments install touchless features such as water faucets, soap dispensers, and towel dispensers that turn on with the wave of a hand.Absent more hygienic upgrades, Wang advises wearing a face mask when using a public restroom. And one of the most effective ways to keep potentially infected aerosols of any kind from flying into the air, Wang adds, is to simply install lids on public toilets.  “Manufacturers should design a new toilet, in which the lid is automatically put down before flushing," says Wang.",
"For anyone who grows anxious at the sound of a sneeze or a cough these days, Lydia Bourouiba’s research offers little comfort.Bourouiba, a fluid dynamics scientist at MIT, has spent the last few years using high-speed cameras and light to reveal how expulsions from the human body can spread pathogens, such as the novel coronavirus. Slowed to 2,000 frames per second, video and images from her lab show that a fine mist of mucus and saliva can burst from a person’s mouth at nearly a hundred miles an hour and travel as far as 27 feet. When the sternutation is over, a turbulent cloud of droplet-containing gas can remain suspended for several minutes, depending on the size of the droplet.Understanding exactly how these clouds travel and disperse is critical to containing infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Many knowledge gaps remain over how it spreads. Bourouiba’s research highlights an ongoing scientific debate about how the new coronavirus moves through the air, suggesting such airborne transfer may be more likely than previously thought.Guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends people stay at least six feet apart from one another, likely falls short because it doesn’t take fluid dynamics into account, Bourouiba says. She and her colleagues have documented a droplet from a sneeze traveling more than four times that distance. While sneezing is not one of the common symptoms of COVID-19, an asymptomatic person with seasonal allergies or a random sneeze could still spread the germ.“That has implications for how many people you can put in a space,” she says. “It has implications for how to handle teamwork and meetings, especially if the airflow isn’t changed regularly.”When a virus that infects the respiratory system leaves the human body, it’s contained within a droplet of saliva and mucus. For decades, scientists have categorized these as either large droplets—larger than five to 10 microns—or small droplets, called aerosols.The larger the droplet, the more likely it is to quickly fall to the ground or on nearby objects after it’s expelled. If a person touches these droplets and then rubs their face, they can contract the virus, which is why it’s important for people to frequently wash their hands. Smaller droplets, however, are less predictable. They can travel greater distances, though in the right conditions, they will quickly evaporate.Agencies such as the CDC and the World Health Organization classify diseases as being predominantly spread by large particles or small particles; COVID-19 is believed to spread primarily through large respiratory particles.But Bourouiba’s research suggests that dichotomy may be arbitrary. Her study indicates that a sneeze can expel droplets of various sizes 23 to 27 feet from a nose. Exactly how long they remain before evaporating depends on several conditions, including humidity and temperature. Aerosols typically dry out more quickly, but small virus-containing droplets can last for minutes trapped inside the warm, moist cloud of a sneeze.And experts still don’t know exactly how much of the coronavirus is required to make someone sick.“We don’t have an infectious dose yet, so how many particles would you have to be exposed to? It’s hard to say,” says Joshua Santarpia of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Studies of influenza show that not all transmission routes are equally likely to make you sick, and larger droplets carry larger doses of virus, making infection more likely.“The jury is still out on whether COVID-19 spreads by aerosols,” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. In a study published earlier this month in Nature Medicine, Cowling and his research team found that influenza can spread through aerosols, and he suspects the novel coronavirus may also spread through the air across short distances.“Influenza in many ways is similar,” says Donald Milton, an aerosol transmission expert from the University of Maryland. “We’ve been studying influenza for a hundred years, and there’s still no agreement on how it’s transmitted because it’s hard to nail this down.”Much of what we know about how this coronavirus spreads through the air is based on samples collected from rooms of people infected with COVID-19. But conducting these types of studies comes with uncertainty.“It’s pretty hard to collect virus from the air because collecting fine particles through a filter tends to dry them out,” Milton says. “All you can tell is there’s RNA there, and it’s not clear that it’s still infectious.”Health experts believe it is unlikely that activities that cause heavy breathing, such as running or biking, increase the chances of transmission, but a study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that loud talking can expel respiratory droplets up to three feet from the speaker.Masks may help reduce spread, but they are most effective when worn by those carrying the virus, and they must be used properly to protect others. There is currently no evidence that wearing a mask prevents healthy people from contracting respiratory infections, according to the WHO. However, people who show no symptoms from COVID-19 could still spread the disease, so the CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public.Given what Bourouiba’s research shows about the extraordinary distances people can launch respiratory droplets, one of the most important things everyone can do is make sure to cover their nose and mouth when they sneeze or cough.",
"Tailor Elase Wong making masks out of patterned material at a shop in Hong Kong on February 20, 2020. Faced with shortages in the midst of a virus outbreak, Hong Kong residents have started making their own face masks, from professional factories to seamstresses churning out coverings on sewing machines.In five minutes, Brianna Slatnick can teach hospital staff how to make an air-filtering faceguard akin to the N95 respirators that are widely recommended to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Made with simple parts that cost less than $3 combined and are common in hospitals, the version she and colleagues created does not look factory-made, but they say it works.A viral video of the technique, developed at Boston Children’s Hospital, shows Slatnick, a surgical innovation fellow and general surgery resident, as she fits together an anesthesia mask with a basic filter, attaches elastic straps, and pulls the contraption to her face. The invention has not been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the federal agency charged with workplace safety oversight, and Boston Children’s is not using the device near patients yet because it still has standard supplies on hand.As the global spread of COVID-19 accelerates, this sort of do-it-yourself response to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is becoming increasingly common, with medical researchers, businesses, and citizen-scientists designing their own face masks, respirators, and ventilators.“The CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus,” President Donald Trump said at a White House press briefing on April 3, citing recent research on asymptomatic cases. “In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical, cloth-face covering as an additional, voluntary public health measure.”But are homemade devices safe? So far, the evidence is scant and mixed, and while a few ideas show promise, there is some concern that stopgap measures could make things worse. A study published April 2 in The Lancet found that the coronavirus could survive on cloth for at least a day and on surgical masks for up to seven days. And on April 7, The World Health Organization said there is currently no evidence that wearing any kind of mask can prevent healthy people in their communities from getting a respiratory infection, including COVID-19.“The last thing you want is for healthcare workers to have a false sense of protection and [inadvertently] perform a risky procedure on a patient,” says Christopher Friese, professor of nursing and public health at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.Here’s what we know about the most widely proposed DIY gear, and how healthcare experts are embracing the trend in a time of dire need.The internet is bursting with instructions for DIY surgical masks and articles peppered with arguments over the best patterns and materials to use, but the medical opinion on homemade masks is mixed.In a 2013 study, researchers in the U.K. tested a variety of everyday materials as filters for surgical masks, including cotton T-shirts, dishtowels, pillowcases, and vacuum cleaner bags. While the makeshift masks were better than nothing at all, none of the materials worked as well as a commercial surgical mask, which filtered out three times as many particles in a test chamber and blocked twice as many droplets in a cough test. (Respiratory droplets are the primary way diseases like COVID-19 spread.)However, the homemade versions did prevent some microbes from getting through, suggesting the makeshift masks were better than nothing at all, says study co-author Anna Davies, a research facilitator at the University of Cambridge (U.K,) and a former public health microbiologist.DIY hand sanitizer can be effective as long as facilities are sterilizing their equipment and using high-quality materials. Here, Abby Gruppuso, Head of Operations and Peter Cornillie, Head Distiller at the Better Man Distilling Company pour the chemicals used to make hand sanitizer on April 01, 2020 in Patchogue, New York. The distillery has transitioned their production from spirits to making hand sanitizer in response to the coronavirus crisis. The hand sanitizer will be distributed to municipalities like the New York Police Department, the United States Postal Service, National Grid, the Patchogue Volunteer Ambulance and Patchogue Fire Department, but it is not for general public use at the moment.A separate study, from 2015, casts additional doubt on homemade masks. In a randomized trial in Vietnam, healthcare workers who wore cloth masks acquired more respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses than their colleagues who wore surgical masks. Lab tests showed that 97 percent of particles got through the cloth masks, compared to 44 percent with surgical masks. One caveat: This study did not compare wearing cloth masks to no masks at all, so the additional infections could have been due to continuously re-using the cloth masks.Yet even if the cloth masks aren’t perfect, they could theoretically slow the spread of a disease by helping keep the virus from escaping people’s noses and mouths, Davies says. A small study published April 2 in Nature Medicine shows surgical masks worn by sick individuals can block the spread of coronavirus, whether it be via respiratory droplets or airborne particles.Regardless, Davies wrote in a recent summary of her team’s findings that social distancing, hand-washing, and the avoidance of face touching are by far the most effective ways to protect society, adding that masks should be a last resort that is meant to prevent “an unavoidable risk of exposure.” (Here’s how long coronavirus lasts on surfaces and in the air.)Recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, N95 respirators (which filter at least 95 percent of airborne particles), are considered the best line of facial protection for healthcare workers treating patients with COVID-19. One problem: they should be discarded after a single use. So some people are trying to find ways to clean their respirators.At Duke University, researchers have developed a decontamination procedure with hydrogen peroxide. The University of Nebraska created a similar protocol using ultraviolet light. But not all researchers are focused on cleansing; some are driven to invention.In March, a group of more than a dozen surgeons, medical students and residents, respiratory therapists, and others participated in a COVID-19 hackathon at Boston Children’s Hospital. After discussing ideas by video conference, they met in a large room—perfect for social distancing—and worked for 10 hours with scissors, rubber glue, silicone caulking, elastic, coffee filters, anesthesia face masks, and medical filters to create a novel ventilator for a novel pandemic.By the end of the day, they had a working prototype for the DIY respirator that features in the team’s video, which Slatnick narrates. (And they have already made a second version.) Preliminary tests of 11 healthy people who followed directions to make their own respirators indicate that users had stable oxygen levels, heart rates, and respiration after wearing the mask for 20 minutes.Engineering challenges remain; the respirator must be durable, fit well, and filter out particles. Still, the Boston Children’s design appears to be gaining momentum. “We have received photos from all around the world of people utilizing the device,” Slatnick says. “There is a severe shortage of PPE in many institutions, and the fact that physicians are reaching out to us to consider using a device that is not NIOSH approved speaks to the fact that they’re very worried.”A shortage of ventilators is raising concerns about the ability of U.S. hospitals to treat surges of COVID-19 patients. According to one estimate, the U.S. has roughly 160,000 ventilators—not nearly enough to cover the projected need, as also predicted by past studies that identified critical weaknesses in medical supply chains. An experimental technique to use one ventilator on multiple patients received attention—and much criticism from medical specialists—when some New York City hospitals recently adopted the risky practice.Ventilators are in high demand, and University of Florida mechanical engineer and anesthesiology professor Samsun Lampotang is responding with PVC pipe, a sprinkler valve used to water lawns, and computer boards. Based on open-source blueprints and built with the help of his research group—which had previously engineered traditional ventilators—Lampotang’s makeshift ventilator is nearing completion.His goal is to design a reliable DIY ventilator that can be assembled with basic hardware and software in less than five hours and for as little as $250. This would be significantly quicker and cheaper than what it will take for non-healthcare companies such as General Motors to ramp up production on traditional ventilators, as directed by the White House.Once the device is built, it must be tested with artificial lungs nonstop for three weeks—the maximum amount of time a patient might need it—before the team deems it ready for human use. Early reports are promising, Lampotang says, and he is already fielding numerous requests from doctors.But what happens if the design is still undergoing testing when hospitals in places such as New York run out of ventilators—do they use Lampotang’s version anyway? “Here’s where the ethical dilemma is,” he says. “Unfortunately, we are running out of time.”",
"This intricately folded structure is the Airgami mask from <a href="https://www.airgami.life/">Air99 LLC.</a> The folding pattern imparts unique properties to the structure, helping it fit snugly around the face.For Richard Gordon, origami is like a piece of music. While an individual fold may not be particularly impressive, many together can make the paper sing. A floppy sheet can transform into a flapping bird, a floating boat, a blooming flower, or in the case of Gordon’s latest endeavor, a face mask.“It’s a kind of alchemy,” says Gordon, the founder and CEO of Air99 LLC.Gordon is one of a growing number of mask designers who see the promise of better fit, function, and even fashion in the ancient art of origami. He began crafting masks more than a decade ago in Suzhou, China, when he couldn't find a mask that properly fit his son to protect against air pollution. But the pandemic has given Gordon and other designers’ work fresh urgency.As we wait our turn in the vaccination line, donning a mask is a critical measure—along with social distancing, ventilation, faster testing, and more—to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Newly inaugurated President Joe Biden is calling for all Americans to wear a mask during the first 100 days of his term, and he signed new executive orders requiring masks in federal buildings, on federal lands, and on many planes, trains, public ships, city busses, and in airports.“We’re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus," Biden said during the inauguration. "We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.”Masks may also become a mainstay after the pandemic to help keep both viruses and pollution at bay. While masking is already part of daily life in other countries, that hadn’t been the case for the United States. But a recent National Geographic and Morning Consult poll signaled a shifting attitude in the U.S. toward masking up. Some 63 percent of 2,200 American adults said they would continue to always or sometimes wear a mask while running errands post-pandemic. A similar number, around 64 percent, said they would turn to masks to fend off air pollution. And 67 percent said they would mask up during flu season.Yet there’s a long list of mask complaints. Some flat coverings quickly turn into moist bits of cloth pressed across your face. Others can lead to a feeling of suffocation, even though cloth and medical masks allow plenty of oxygen through for healthy adults. And while all masks afford some level of viral protection, some are more effective than others. Origami holds promise to help alleviate many of these woes.The first major hurdle for origami mask designs is material. The mask isn’t a simple sieve. Instead, the material is more like a maze for particles—the more chances the particles have to run into a wall, the better the filter works. Two or three layers are better than one, and materials with less orderly structures, like the non-woven polypropylene of an N95 mask, make better filters. But most common fabrics are no good for origami, which requires rigidity in order to hold folds.One potential solution is a polypropylene material commonly used in hospitals to wrap surgical instruments, explains Shu Yang, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. She and her colleagues turned to this wrap during the early days of the pandemic when protective gear was running short.A study of one common wrap called Halyard H300 suggested that three layers of the material could achieve a filter efficiency close to N95 masks, the gold standard for filtration, which block at least 95 percent of 0.3-micron particles and even increase in efficiency for both larger and smaller particulates. What’s more, the wrap is readily available in large sheets and is stiff enough to hold folds. Last spring, Yang and her colleagues delivered 10,000 origami masks made of the wrap to the University of Pennsylvania's medical school in case of shortages.Another solution for holding a crease is creating an outer skeleton of stiff material. Air99's Airgami mask, for example, is made of a flexible N95-grade filter fused with a more rigid and foldable layer. Since the outer structure doesn't allow air to pass through, it's punched with holes so air can reach the filter layer. And tests suggest that these materials can be sanitized with heat and reused multiple times.Other materials that are more readily available to the public can also be effective for some folded mask designs, says Jonathan Realmuto, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Irvine. For example, non-fiberglass MERV-13 filters, which are commonly used for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, are particularly effective and available at most hardware stores.Finding the right material is just the first step of crafting an effective mask. “It doesn’t matter how good the filter is if you don’t have a good fit,” says John Volckens of Colorado State University, who led an intensive testing effort to document the filtration efficiencies for an array of materials.When improperly designed or worn, masks can have gaps around the nose or cheeks, allowing entry and exit points for potentially virus-laden particles to flow—and closing these gaps is where origami truly shines.Origami techniques are already central to many masks on the market today, Volckens notes. 3M’s VFlex, for example, combines folding with heat welding to hold the material together, creating a more comfortable version of an N95. But N95s are not yet widely available, as U.S. supplies are still reeling from skyrocketed demand. The U.S. is the world's largest importer of face masks—and continued failures of the federal government to scale up U.S. mask production have, in part, driven lingering shortages.The dire need for more masks has inspired a variety of origami designs, from masks that anyone can make at home to designs that challenge everyone but the most expert of folders.Features as simple as changing the angles of the pleats of common surgical masks can dramatically improve fit. This idea is at the heart of Jiangmei Wu’s folded mask design. Wu, an origami artist and associate professor of interior design at Indiana University, started experimenting with mask patterns after receiving a call from her brother in Hong Kong as the coronavirus started taking hold in January 2020.“My goal was to find a design that was very simple and easy, and also fits very well,” she says. By rethinking the folds at the mask edges, Wu created three designs that each fit slightly different face profiles. She tested multiple options for mask material, landing on an outer mask layer of a type of non-woven polypropylene similar to those used in surgical masks but heavier and stiffer, which allows for folding. (Wu is still testing the mask's filtration capacity and breathability.)Other origami designs were developed as a way for people to create their own masks, even those who lack sewing skills. For example, a pattern developed by UC Irvine's Realmuto and his colleagues was designed to be made in emergencies using readily available items. The folds, he says, limit leakage along the mask seams.Gordon’s Airgami, however, is much more intricate. Interlocking paper valleys and mountains impart unique properties to the structure, he explains. Unlike a rubber band that narrows when stretched, the Airgami mask expands when pulled across the face, a feature of so-called auxetic materials. The result is a mask that stays flush to the face, even while the wearer is in motion."I can look down, I can talk while I’ve got it on, shake my head. It doesn’t want to come off," Gordon says. (The Airgami passed independently conducted N95 fit and filtration tests, and the company is continuing to work toward full certification by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.)Some origami mask designs can also improve the wearer's comfort. The folds give the mask structure and prevent the mouth from touching the material, eliminating the discomfort of a damp mask on the skin. Wu added rigidity to her latest design by heating a narrow line along the center of the mask, which melts the fabric into a vertical ridge.The folds of the Airgami mask make it easier to breathe by dramatically increasing the amount of surface area for air to pass through. Unfolded, the filter is two to three times as large as common N95s."It’s like breathing through a straw versus a big pipe," Gordon says of a mask with low surface area.One unexpected benefit of the many folding patterns is stylistic flair, from the minimalist folds of Wu's design to the mesmerizing fan of Gordon's. Wu and Gordon also note that their mask materials could be printed in different colors and patterns. If you can make something aesthetically pleasing, people will feel more comfortable—and be more likely to wear it, Yang says."People seem to be hardwired to find origami beautiful," Gordon says.The more complex the design, however, the more challenging a mask is to make. “I think those sorts of innovations are wonderful,” Volckens says. But he adds, “until you’re making a million of those a day, you’re not making a dent in the problem.”Even Wu’s simple pleated mask design has proven tricky to manufacture inexpensively, she says. She’s currently seeking ways to produce the masks in large quantities for less than a dollar each. "That’s the challenge of origami," Wu says. "How do we take origami to mass production?"Gordon and his team similarly are continuing to work on speeding up production. The masks are available for purchase at $33.99 apiece, but Gordon hopes to bring the cost down as the company improves manufacturing. While he has developed tools to assist with folding, the design's complexity means that the Airgami still must be folded by hand. The time to make a mask is measured in minutes. "We have to get down to seconds," Gordon says.But mask designers are optimistic about the future of origami. Gordon likes to reference a 2008 TED talk by renowned origami artist and physicist Robert Lang. "As weird and surprising as it may sound,” Lang said, “origami may someday even save a life.""You can bet your bottom dollar that Robert was right," Gordon adds.",
"President Donald Trump wears a protective face mask as he is driven in a motorcade outside of Walter Reed National Military Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on Sunday. Trump announced early Friday that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized over the weekend. His public position on mask-wearing has changed over the past months, as has his supporters’ mask-wearing behavior.American attitudes and their usage of masks have shifted broadly as President Trump has been hospitalized for COVID-19, a National Geographic and Morning Consult poll taken over the weekend has found.More than 6 in 10 Americans questioned say they are more favorable toward people wearing a mask, and there have been steady increases in mask usage among people of all ages, demographic groups, and political leanings since a similar poll in July.Despite noisy no-mask protests, 92 percent of 2,200 Americans polled say they wear a face mask when leaving their home, with 74 percent saying they “always” do. That “always” percentage is up nearly a quarter since July, according to the poll, which has a 2 percent margin of error.Public health officials call a mask an effective way to curtail airborne transmission of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans since February and sickened more than 7.4 million. Forty-four states require mask usage in certain situations. (New algorithms can detect whether people are complying with these mask requirements.)Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the poll results:",
"Public shaming over not wearing a face mask started almost as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic itself. In February, some provinces and municipalities in China made it mandatory to wear masks when in public. News reports soon followed of residents and police chastising the non-compliant, a trend that’s now seen globally.When Akash Takyar heard those early stories trickle out of China, he was shocked at how things were being handled, and he wondered if his software company—LeewayHertz—could offer a more peaceful way. Takyar recognized how important it is to wear a mask to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But rather than leave members of the public to monitor each other, he wanted to develop a computer program that could look at images and detect whether people are wearing masks.His San Francisco-based company is one of many now pioneering mask recognition as a way to get people to comply for the public good. So far, masks have been confounding traditional facial recognition software—but these new machine learning tools could conceivably be used in private or public spaces to measure compliance and ostensibly take that out of the hands of individuals.Tryolabs' software identifies whether visible faces are uncovered or wearing masks as they pass by a closed-circuit television camera near Temple Bar in Dublin, Ireland. CCTV footage collected by EarthCam; analysis courtesy of Tryolabs.Examining CCTV footage with mask recognition could offer a sense of how many people are compliant with health guidance in a particular area, such as the Little Italy neighborhood of New York City. CCTV footage collected by EarthCam; analysis courtesy of Tryolabs.To date, 34 states and the District of Columbia have mask mandates for public spaces, both outdoors and indoors. But compliance can vary depending on a range of factors, from personal politics to an individual’s financial ability to purchase masks. For the most part, people who flout the mandates even if they can afford to follow them get away with that noncompliance. Only a few reports—from Nevada, Louisiana, and Indiana—show that law enforcement has stepped in to arrest people who were indoors in private businesses without a mask.For businesses that have workers returning to indoor facilities, noncompliance could lead to others in the workplace getting infected. Ultimately, it could be a great loss for a business if there was an outbreak because someone was asymptomatic and failed to wear a mask, says Takyar.But “face data is as precious as a fingerprint,” says Deborah Raji, a fellow at the AI Now Institute at New York University. And those who have had qualms about facial recognition wonder whether mask recognition software, as well intentioned as it may be, should have a place in today’s society.Today’s facial recognition software studies the features around the eye, nose, mouth, and ears to identify an individual whose picture is already supplied, either by the individual or in a criminal database. Wearing a mask obstructs this recognition—an issue that many systems have already encountered, and others have solved. For example, Apple’s FaceID, which uses facial recognition so users can unlock their iPhone, recently released a system update that can, in essence, detect when a person is wearing a mask. The update quickly recognizes a covered mouth and nose and prompts the user to enter their passcode instead of making them pull down their face covering.Developers say that mask recognition software in theory bypasses privacy issues because the programs don’t actually identify the people. Such software is trained on two sets of images: one to teach the algorithm how to recognize a face (“face detection”) and a second to figure out how to recognize a mask on a face (“mask recognition”). The machine learning algorithm doesn’t identify the faces in any way that can link a face to a specific person, because it doesn’t use a training set—the set of examples used to train such programs—with faces that are linked to identities.Tryolabs' software has two main components: The "pose" algorithms decipher different parts of the body before the "classification" algorithms decide if the facial region includes a mask.The “pose” algorithms make simple drawings of body parts and their positions with colored lines. Once a head is pinpointed, the software crops an image of the potential face.The "classification" algorithms decide whether the cropped image of the face contains a mask. This process is repeated several times during a video sequence, each time adding a new dot under the face squares in the side panel. The dots are colored green, red, or yellow, meaning "mask," "no mask," or "can't decide," respectively. The program will say "unknown" if the face is not clearly visible (for example, if the person is facing away from the camera) or if it is uncertain whether a mask is present.Companies that have developed mask recognition software say that they ultimately want this technology to be used in broad ways that help people set policy or enhance awareness campaigns.“If we can compute the number [of people who are complying with the mask mandates], people can make policies and monitor on whether or not they need to do another campaign to push mask usage,” says Alan Descoins, the chief technology officer of Tryolabs, a company based in Montevideo, Uruguay, that’s developed mask recognition software. “Or if people start getting bored about COVID, and start not wearing masks, then there might need to be more publicity to make people aware.”LeewayHertz’s algorithm, for example, could be used in real time and integrated with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. From a given frame in a video, it isolates images and organizes them into two categories, people who are wearing masks and those who are not. Currently, this recognition software is being used in “stealth mode” in multiple settings in the United States and Europe. Restaurants and hotels are using it to make sure the staff is complying with wearing masks. One airport on the East Coast of the United States is also testing the technology on-site, says Taykar.These private companies would have control over this data and how it’s deployed. Department stores could use it to dole out face coverings to noncompliant patrons, for instance, or a company could fire an employee who refuses to comply with wearing masks in the workplace.While Taykar sees a strong reason to use mask recognition software in private spaces, public use might be more fraught: “If you’re in Times Square and there’s no social distancing, what do you do with that data? Would you want to put their photo on the billboards?”James Lewis sees how mask recognition could be useful for maintaining compliance during the pandemic. But as director of the Technology Policy Program for the Center of Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., he is more concerned about the lack of rules that govern how this collected data gets used.As it stands, the U.S. does not have a federal law that governs data privacy. Instead, the country relies on a patchwork of regulations relating to specific sectors, such as health, financial transactions, and marketing. In addition, corporations and entities that collect our private data don’t have to tell us what’s happening to it.The situation has made many people distrustful. Three months before COVID-19 made it to the U.S., a Pew Research Center survey found that Americans generally feel “concerned, confused, and … [a] lack of control over their personal information.”Critics of mask recognition also think that this new technology could be prone to some of the same pitfalls as facial recognition. Many of the training datasets used for facial recognition are dominated by light-skinned individuals. In 2019 Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, and the AI Now Institute’s Deborah Raji investigated the accuracy of commercially available datasets used by major tech companies. When they checked the performance of recognition systems using an algorithm trained with the standard datasets, and then using a new set of faces with much more racial and ethnic balance, the researchers found that the algorithm was less than 70 percent accurate in identifying new faces.One more aspect of machine learning to take into account: Nobody really knows what the algorithm is using to make its decision. Say, for instance, you want to train an algorithm to recognize a cow. “You think you’re showing the model a bunch of examples of a cow, but you don’t realize that in order to come up with the label of cow, [the algorithm] might be looking at the grassy fields in the background,” Raji says.Applying that principle to facial or mask recognition: it’s possible that the machine learning models could pick up on other “background” features, such as race and gender, that would cause it to make mistakes about whether someone is wearing a mask. “There are other artifacts that influence [the algorithm’s] decision,” Raji says—and machine learning researchers are just coming to terms with this limitation of the technique.She also believes that getting people to wear masks might not require a technological fix in the first place. To her, mask recognition feels like “technology theatre,” introducing software—and igniting privacy debates—to address a problem while completely side-stepping the underlying issue.To get people to comply with mask usage rules, there’s a better way than using recognition systems that have the potential to infringe on civil liberties, says Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor for San Francisco who led a 2019 bill banning the use of facial recognition by law enforcement.“Walking around with that level of invasion doesn’t make for a healthy society,” Peskin told National Geographic. He noted that police in New York City were stationed at Washington Square Park to hand out face masks to passersby.Just this week, Portland, Oregon has passed a law that would ban public and private use of facial recognition, becoming the first city where using the technology is illegal. But Oregon also has a state-wide mask mandate, and Hector Dominguez, the Smart City Open Data Coordinator for Portland, sees mask recognition as different from facial recognition with regards to its privacy risks.“We’re in the middle of a crisis. We need to start creating more awareness around privacy” with regards to how data gets used or shared in general, he says. Even though Portland’s facial recognition ban wouldn’t affect the use of mask recognition systems, Dominguez is wary that mask recognition systems would in fact capture more: “Masks are not going to stop facial recognition,” he says.Ultimately, the pitfall of mask recognition is that it might set a dangerous precedent for what happens when the pandemic is over, say its critics.“There’s a willingness to relax the rules when it comes to anything related to COVID,” says Lewis of CSIS. “The issue is, when this is over, will we go back?”",
"The surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is covered in protein spikes (red). Moderna’s messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine would teach the human body to recognize these spikes, allowing the body to produce an army of neutralizing antibodies (white) to stop the coronavirus before it can establish an infection.A promising coronavirus vaccine candidate hit another milestone this week, when Moderna Therapeutics began phase three of clinical trials. The move signals the biotech company and the National Institutes of Health, which are collaborating on the trial, are one step away from bringing the drug to the public and commercial markets.After nearly seven months of global deaths and economic shutdowns wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, people are anxiously awaiting a glimmer of hope for a return to normal routines. This partly explains the continued frenzy over vaccine development, including a candidate from the University of Oxford that also recently entered phase three in Brazil. (Read: Now that the Oxford vaccine has entered its final phase of COVID-19 trials, here's what happens.)Moderna moved its candidate from the lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts to human trials in a record-setting 63 days, making it the frontrunner. On May 18, the company announced preliminary findings that healthy subjects had responded to its mRNA vaccine by producing “neutralizing antibodies.” Antibodies are the key sentinels made by the immune system to prevent infection by the coronavirus. Experts were quick to point out that the results applied to only eight people out of 45 in the trial. The company took another two months to release a peer-reviewed study with sufficient information to gauge whether phase one subjects had protective immune responses, which is widely considered by immunologists to involve more than simply producing antibodies.The details that Moderna presented suggest that the company may be on its way to achieving something unprecedented: licensing the first mRNA vaccine for human use.Pharmacist Michael Witte (left) gives Rebecca Sirull a shot in the first phase of a clinical trial for a potential vaccine for COVID-19 on March 16, 2020. Sirull is the third patient to receive the shot in the study at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, one of three sites participating in the phase one trial.“The results are exciting, because they've got phase one data showing that the vaccine is safe, which is a big deal,” says Ali Salem, a drug developer and professor at the University of Iowa’s College of Pharmacy who is not involved in the Moderna trial.Moderna’s phase three trial will involve an estimated 30,000 participants tested at 89 sites spread across 30 states and the District of Columbia. The aim is to determine if two doses of the mRNA vaccine prevent people from catching COVID-19, stop those with the disease from dying, or both.“Our principal investigators would easily say that these studies are the most important that they’ve done in their lifetimes,” says Jaime Farra, a marketing director at the Alliance for Multispecialty Research, which is running a site involved in phase two that is now also conducting phase-three tests in Newton, Kansas.Yet the introduction of phase three is somewhat unusual given Moderna hasn’t completed phase two of its trial, which began in late May. While phase one is an initial safety check among healthy individuals, phase two is meant to give the first indications that a vaccine can be used among patients sickened by the disease.If phase three were to fail, it would vindicate those who have questioned the decision to expedite Moderna’s candidate as part of Operation Warp Speed. This federal project, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, has also already scheduled phase three trials with 30,000 subjects for the Oxford vaccine and a candidate being developed by Johnson and Johnson. Still, skeptics argue that fast-tracking Moderna’s candidate is a gamble in light of the up-and-down history of mRNA vaccines.Whenever a germ infects a body, our immune systems scramble to recognize and mount a response. Traditional vaccines take advantage of that response by injecting whole but inactive viruses, or their whole proteins, into our bodies, triggering an immune reaction. These vaccines take time to develop, in part because scientists must grow and inactivate an entire germ or its proteins in a specific way.Messenger RNA is genetic material made of nucleic acid—the same stuff as our DNA—that travels throughout our cells, giving final instructions on which proteins to build to form the body’s cellular architecture. In the early 1990s, scientists wondered what would happen if they manufactured pieces of viral DNA and mRNA and then injected them into human cells or lab animals. The hope was that the cells would take in the genetic snippets, make viral proteins, and trigger an immune response.In theory, this method would allow scientists to make vaccines faster; instead of weeks, a candidate could be ready to test in hours or days. These vaccine candidates would also be more flexible and durable against germs that tend to evolve through mutation, such as coronaviruses, influenza, and HIV. This could help lead to a universal vaccine that would work against multiple strains of a virus, says Margaret Liu, chairman of the board for the International Society of Vaccines.Thirty years ago, Liu was among the first wave of lab researchers to try to use DNA and mRNA vaccines; her early results with a universal DNA vaccine for influenza were the first to show protection and showed the most promise—at least in mice. Overall, the early days of DNA vaccines and mRNA vaccines showed repeated success in animal models, which is known as the “pre-clinical” stage of drug development, but then couldn’t generate potent immune responses in humans.“People thought, well, it must be because humans are bigger,” Liu says. But that hypothesis lost support after successful DNA vaccines were developed for horses, fish, and California condors.Meanwhile, mRNA vaccines struggled with weakened stability. Once inside the body, the mRNA from a vaccine breaks down faster than DNA, which also limits the immune potency. Additionally, mRNA can aggravate immune cells, causing adverse reactions. For years, these challenges sidelined mRNA vaccines and relegated DNA vaccines to veterinary medicine.The narrative began to shift in 2005, when scientists at the University of Pennsylvania introduced slight chemical modifications to mRNA vaccines. These changes added durability and made the vaccines safer, causing fewer adverse immune responses.“A lot of people started to look at mRNA as a therapeutic strategy for a variety of diseases,” the University of Iowa’s Salem says. One of these offshoots would become “ModeRNA Therapeutics,” now known as Moderna, a company created in 2010 after Harvard researcher Derrick Rossi used modified mRNA to reprogram stem cells in a bid to treat cardiovascular disease.Over the years, the company also came to rely on a popular tool for drug delivery called lipid nanoparticles. By packing genetic material inside a slippery pod made of oily lipids, these particles could more easily slide mRNA into cells, where it could go to work. With safer mRNA technology and better drug delivery, the company was able to expand its portfolio and pursue remedies for cancer and a range of infectious diseases, including the flu. But the major turning point arrived with the mosquito-borne Zika virus.Dozens of crown-like spikes (red), which give coronaviruses their name, protrude from the surface of the virus and enable infection of a human cell.After a vaccine convinces the body to make neutralizing antibodies (white), these sentinels ward off the virus by attaching to its spike proteins. To make a vaccine, the genetic and molecular structure of the virus needs to be understood. Watch a video of the virus's components here.After Zika emerged in 2015, laboratories rushed to find a suitable vaccine. Justin Richner, now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was part of a multi-university effort to conduct early research on mRNA vaccine candidates made by Moderna Therapeutics. Richner says the team honed the mRNA codes, which led one of Moderna’s Zika vaccines into early human trials in 2016—where it stalled.Moderna Therapeutics did not respond to multiple requests from National Geographic for an interview. But the company’s corporate updates, which are not peer-reviewed, can yield clues about their progress with the COVID-19 vaccine. For example, while Moderna’s May 18 announcement didn’t provide hard numbers about how many antibodies were present in humans or mice after immunization. But it did reveal that the first phase of its COVID-19 trial has apparently achieved its primary goal to determine the safest drug dosage.“When you do a first-in-humans clinical trial, the utmost important information to get out is whether the vaccine is safe,” says Maria Elena Bottazzi, associate dean at Baylor College of Medicine's National School of Tropical Medicine, who is not involved in the Moderna trial.She adds that a better sign of success for Moderna may be something that wasn’t addressed by the company’s early statements and featured briefly in its peer-reviewed study: T-cells. Antibodies are only one branch of an immune response. T-cells are another. Both can form lasting protection on their own, but T-cells help make antibodies emerge. That matters because DNA and mRNA vaccines are better geared toward triggering T-cells, Bottazzi says, but assessing such a response is laborious and typically reserved for later phases of human trials.Still, Moderna could have a long way to go. Phase two subjects are slated to be monitored for at least 15 months, and the third phase isn’t scheduled to finish until October 2022—though if early results in these trials are promising, its approval may be expedited given the pandemic.Regardless of whether Moderna succeeds, the world will need multiple versions of the coronavirus vaccine to beat the pandemic. Globally, more than a hundred COVID-19 vaccine candidate trials are underway, and so far, multiple companies are reporting promising peer-reviewed results. Numerous bets are ultimately an advantage, because if any single vaccine candidate fails, the others remain to offer continued hope, Bottazzi says.A human cell (greenish brown) is heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (pink) isolated from a human patient. This image was captured and color-enhanced at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility in Fort Detrick, Maryland. A vaccine would prevent the virus from replicating and taking over the host’s cells.",
"Gravediggers bury someone who died from th​e coronavirus at Vila Formosa​ Cemetery in São Paulo, Brazil, on Jul​y 7, 2020.Rio de Janeiro, BrazilAndréa Barbosa was thrilled to be jabbed in the arm. The 46-year-old ophthalmologist is one of the 5,000 volunteers in the clinical trial in Brazil of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ChAdOx1. The vaccine is being developed by the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom in collaboration with the biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.In May, Soumya Swaminathan, the head scientist of the World Health Organization, called ChAdOx1 the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Phases one and two of the clinical trial took place simultaneously in April in southern England, when safety and immune responses were checked in more than a thousand healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55. The vaccine is now in the third and final development phase: testing volunteers in Brazil at the Federal University of São Paulo’s Reference Center for Special Immunobiologicals, as well as at two locations run by the D'Or Institute for Research and Education.A box holds samples of ChAdOx1, the University of Oxford vaccine candidate, at the D'Or Institute for Research and Education in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.That makes Brazil an important proving ground as this vaccine candidate continues its rapid march toward approval by the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Eventually, the ChAdOx1 clinical study will also take place in the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Africa, aiming to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers. Preliminary results from all these trials will be collected through November, and if they confirm that the vaccine is effective, the Oxford team will submit it for an initial registration with MHRA by the end of the year.In the U.S., another vaccine candidate from biotech firm Moderna started its phase three clinical trial this week. This trial is recruiting 30,000 volunteers from 89 sites around the country to test the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine, which would be a first of its kind if approved by the National Institutes of Health.Participating in a vaccine trial is a rigorous and time-consuming process. Volunteers must be carefully vetted and monitored for months, and they face some risks from potentially damaging side effects. But, Barbosa says, there’s no question that the effort is worth it. “This is my duty as a citizen. It is a humanitarian cause. Without a vaccine, we don’t know when this situation will be over.” (Here's how we'll know when a COVID-19 vaccine is ready.)Barbosa has been the head of the ophthalmology department at Rede D'Or São Luiz, a system of hospitals operating across Brazil, since 2007. The number of patients visiting her clinics fell from a hundred a day to about a dozen between the end of March and June—mostly people requiring continued treatment for severe conditions such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.Amid the growing COVID-19 public health emergency, Barbosa wanted to join the fight against the virus, so she asked the board of Rede D'Or São Luiz for permission to work on the front lines with other health care professionals. Her request was denied—she was told she had not worked long enough in an emergency care unit. “I was really frustrated about not being able to treat COVID-19 patients,” Barbosa says.So when the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the clinical trial of ChAdOx1, she leaped at the opportunity to participate. “Now I will somehow be part of it,” she says.Oxford University was already using what’s known as viral vector technology to develop a vaccine for another type of coronavirus, MERS, when the current pandemic hit. Since it emerged in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, MERS has been reported in 27 countries, with 2,494 reported cases and 858 deaths to date.The research had reached an advanced stage when SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, was first reported in December 2019, so the scientists used their MERS technology and knowledge as the starting point for a vaccine. They inserted the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the studs on the COVID-19 virus that help it invade cells, into an adenovirus that causes the common cold. Weakened via genetic tweaks and unable to replicate in human cells, the adenovirus acts as the so-called viral vector.A viral vector vaccine works “as a Trojan horse,” according to physician Sue Ann Costa Clemens, coordinator of the study in Brazil. “The adenovirus carries a part of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, hidden in it. This spike will trigger the immune response when injected in humans.”Preliminary results from the first two phases of clinical trials were published by The Lancet on July 20. Participants had minor side effects, such as fatigue and headache, and none had serious adverse reactions. Researchers also identified that the Oxford vaccine had triggered a strong immune response in the two main defenses responsible for detecting and attacking pathogens—antibodies and T-cells.Clemens was responsible for Brazil’s selection for the third phase of the ChAdOx1 trial. The 52-year-old physician from Rio de Janeiro has lived in Italy for about two decades. A professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Siena, where she founded the first global vaccinology course, she’s also a coordinator of the university’s Institute for Global Health and director of the master’s program in vaccinology, and she’s the head of the scientific committee at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.On May 5, Andrew Pollard, who’s the coordinator of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine group and also teaches part of the vaccinology course in Siena, invited Clemens to work on the ChAdOx1 clinical trial. She accepted immediately. Throughout her career, Clemens has guided similar clinical trials requiring extensive recruitment of test takers. In 2005, she worked on a rotavirus vaccine study in Latin America that involved finding 60,000 volunteers over a period of six months.This time, Clemens’ initial goal was to select research centers to carry out the clinical trials. She was looking for places with good medical professionals and a setting with large numbers of people exposed to COVID-19. The Federal University of São Paulo, where she had obtained her Ph.D. degree and is also currently a researcher, met these requirements, and they agreed to participate.“At a phase three trial, the goal is to prove that the vaccine offers protection against the disease,” Clemens says. “How can we work fast to prove it and offer the vaccine to the population in a short period of time?”The trial in Brazil started on June 28 in the three centers, coordinated by Clemens. In total, 5,000 volunteers, divided into two groups, are being vaccinated. One group is receiving the vaccine candidate ChAdOx1; the other gets a control vaccine. This is a randomized, double-blind trial, which means that volunteers are randomly assigned to one of the groups, and neither the vaccinated person nor the researcher knows which vaccine was given to each person until the end of the trial.The researchers chose the quadrivalent meningitis ACWY vaccine as the control. The dosage is similar to that for ChAdOx1, which means volunteers will get similar amounts of the vaccine ingredients. In addition, researchers already know its side effects, including redness or pain at the injection sit and mild flu-like symptoms. The team decided against a placebo vaccine—a substance without an active effect—so that the volunteers could derive some benefit from the study. (This meningitis vaccine generally isn’t widely distributed in Brazil, Clemens says, because it is more expensive.)Andréa Barbosa, the ophthalmologist, met the basic requirements for participation in the vaccine trial: As a health professional, she has significant exposure to the coronavirus in daily life, and she’s between 18 and 55 years old.She had her first visit to the Idor clinic in Botafogo on July 4. A nursing team checked her vital signs, height, and weight. Then she was interviewed to assure that she met all the trial criteria. People with manageable conditions, such as asthma, were accepted, but those with chronic diseases or an immunosuppressive condition were precluded.“My case was a little more complicated because I have episodes of contact allergy, but they went over it, and my type was not an exclusion criterion,” she says. By contact allergy, she means she has mild allergic reactions when certain substances touch her skin.Barbosa signed an informed consent form, confirming her agreement not to participate in other vaccine tests or to get pregnant in the next 12 months and to be available to attend regular checkups. The 15-page form explains the study, the vaccine, and the context of the epidemic and describes the risks involved for participants in the study. It also points out that until the vaccine’s effectiveness has been proven, subjects cannot assume that they’re protected against COVID-19. Volunteers can withdraw from the study at any time.Right after her appointment, she returned to the nursing ward to have a nasal swab sample collected to determine if she was infected with COVID-19. She had a pregnancy test, and nurses collected a blood sample for serology testing to find out if she had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating previous infection. Researchers estimate that 10 percent of volunteers have positive results, making them ineligible to participate.Back in the clinic on July 9, Barbosa was told that all her tests were negative. She was asked again about her health status, then she took another pregnancy test and gave another blood sample. After that, she was finally vaccinated.She was kept under observation for about 30 minutes to monitor her for any immediate adverse effects. Before leaving, she was given pain-relief medication for that day and was asked to fill out a daily online questionnaire.“They ask me if I had nausea or fever. I check my body temperature with the thermometer they provided. I have to record all symptoms and signs observed in the injection site, whether it’s red, stiff, or swollen—they gave me a ruler to measure it,” Barbosa says.Barbosa’s next appointment is on August 1. Until then, she’s leading a normal life working in hospitals and clinics, but always attentive to any potential symptom or reaction she should report in the questionnaire. “I'm watching for any symptoms, but I’m fine—I haven’t felt anything different. I didn’t have any reaction at the injection site. Nothing at all.”If the trial participants show any likely symptoms of COVID-19, they must return to the clinic and be tested. Adverse reactions are assessed regularly, and researchers also check whether subjects have produced antibodies.The body starts developing an immune response between eight and 10 days after the vaccine is given, but full protection isn’t guaranteed during this period. Researchers therefore collect blood samples about 28 days after vaccination, a period long enough to allow the body to produce recognizable defense cells.“Unblinding” the study involves determining whether people assigned to the control group or those who received the trial vaccine were diagnosed with COVID-19. This is how vaccine efficacy is tested. Volunteers will be assessed for one year, but the team will use early data from the trial in Brazil, as well as the expanded trials in the U.S., the U.K., and elsewhere, to move ahead quickly with development.“Partial results from the combination of all of these studies should be ready by November,” Clemens says. “The idea is to combine a registration dossier to be submitted in the United Kingdom, and if vaccine efficacy is proven, it can be licensed there this year.” Vaccine deployment would start right after that in the U.K. and other countries, including Brazil.In April, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to produce a billion doses of the vaccine. They agreed to sell the vaccine at cost, to make it as widely available as possible.",
"Neal Browning receives a shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, Monday, March 16, 2020, at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.Private David Lewis was hiking with his platoon through the snow, despite feeling unwell from the flu. It was January 1976, and the 19-year-old Lewis was stationed in New Jersey’s Fort Dix, where about 230 other soldiers ultimately fell ill. But Lewis, who collapsed 13 miles into the training hike and succumbed soon afterward, was the only one to die. His passing sent the United States into panic mode.The strain collected at Fort Dix appeared similar to the one behind the 1918 flu pandemic, and this connection made it big news. By the 1970s, high-risk groups were being urged to get flu shots—so the government immediately sought to tailor the vaccine against the Fort Dix strain, hoping 80 percent of the population would take it.What followed was a debacle. The hastily-developed vaccine was linked to more than 500 cases of paralysis, and 25 people died from it. Soon after news of the Fort Dix outbreak first broke, half of the general public had voiced their intentions to get immunized. But as events unfolded, only 22 percent of the U.S. population ended up getting the vaccine by year’s end.Now, as COVID-19 sweeps across the world and more than 140 vaccines are in the works to protect against it, the question is: How will we know when one is good enough and safe enough to counsel people to take it?Although a typical vaccine can take years to get off the ground, those designed in this pandemic are moving ahead at a pace never seen before. At least one candidate, from the biotech company Moderna, is headed into phase three trials in July. In May, the U.S. government launched Operation Warp Speed, putting billions of dollars toward accelerating the design and testing of potential vaccines.Some scientists are wary of settling on the first vaccine that comes to fruition. It’s a delicate balancing act for public health officials to decide when a vaccine is ready for mass rollout to the public.If, for instance, they scale up production of a vaccine with limited effectiveness and promote it heavily, that might dissuade developers from striving to bring a better one to the market. “If you accept a vaccine with low efficacy, then you probably prevent the development of a vaccine with higher efficacy,” cautions Roland Sutter, who was coordinator for research, policy, product development, and containment for polio at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, until retiring in December.Parsing what makes a COVID-19 vaccine good enough for mass rollout is the primary challenge for scientists and policy makers in the coming months. They’ll also need to ensure appropriate safety checks—or risk repeating the mistakes of 1976 and losing public confidence.Vaccine development comes in stages, starting with phase one trials. These clinical trials generally assess the initial safety of a drug in a relatively small number of people; sometimes about 50 or so participants, although the number can vary widely.Expanded phase two trials give an inkling of the vaccine’s efficacy. That’s often gauged by analyzing people’s blood to see if antibodies or other immunity sentinels are present that can neutralize the targeted pathogen.Phase three trials try to better measure how well the vaccine protects people by scaling up to include thousands of participants and typically comparing the protection conferred to those who undergo immunization against those who receive a placebo.But the real test, vaccine scientists say, comes when these preventative drugs are approved and given widely.“A clinical trial is still quite a controlled environment,” says Charlie Weller, head of the vaccines program at Wellcome, a London-based biomedical research funder. People participating in the testing of a vaccine might be more conscientious about their actions and take fewer risks that might expose them to a virus because they are being followed by doctors. “You know you’re in a clinical trial when you’re in a clinical trial, and that might change your behavior,” she says. “So the real test for a vaccine is when it’s rolled out into a population.”Even if they’ve advanced through these trials, some vaccines are simply more effective than others. (The reasons for this are not always clear. It may have to do with intrinsic factors of the virus being targeted—its propensity to mutate and how it propagates in the body—as well as how our immune system naturally interacts with it.)Among vaccines known to be highly effective are the inactivated polio vaccine—a course of three doses of inactivated polio vaccine is virtually 100 percent effective against that disease—and the measles vaccine is roughly 96 percent effective after one dose.Other immunizations are given even though they come with lower probabilities that they’ll protect against disease. Strains of the flu virus change from year to year, and this is part of the reason that receiving the annual vaccine against it will only reduce the risk of catching the virus by about 40 to 60 percent. The vaccine against malaria—known as RTS,S—cuts severe disease by only about a third, but it is still being explored as an option in hard-hit areas of the world. That’s because malaria often claims the lives of young children, and saving even a third of these youngsters translates into a tremendous gain, says Matthew Laurens, pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.For the COVID-19 vaccine, the ideal candidate would be able to establish immunity in at least 70 percent of the population, including the elderly, as outlined in April by the World Health Organization (WHO). On June 28, Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he, too, would settle for a 70 to 75 percent effective vaccine.On the flipside, the WHO says that the minimum acceptable would be a COVID-19 vaccine that was 50 percent effective. On June 30, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mirrored this guidance, releasing a document that set the same baseline target. Some researchers aren’t convinced: “Fifty percent would be terrible,” says Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist at the University of Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College in Canada. “For this pandemic to end, we need to achieve herd immunity,” says Bridle, and a vaccine only effective for 50 percent falls short of getting us to that goal.Other scientists view any vaccine as only one part of a multifaceted approach to reducing the spread of the coronavirus, along with social distancing and wearing masks. “We have to look at the whole public health value of the vaccine,” Laurens says.Immunologists remain ever vigilant about the effects of new vaccines because there have been rare but noteworthy surprises in the past. For example, the first vaccine for diarrhea-causing rotavirus was withdrawn from the market in 1999 when it was linked to an uncommon and potentially fatal sliding of one part of the bowel into another. This severe adverse event wasn’t detected in the clinical trials leading up to its rollout. More recently, in 2009, the Pandemrix vaccine against the swine flu showed signs of a link to narcolepsy in Europe. (The vaccine was never licensed for use in the United States.)“In a small clinical trial with the kinds of platforms that are being examined here for COVID-19, you rarely see severe reactions,” says Wayne Koff, president and CEO of the Human Vaccines Project, a public-private partnership that seeks to accelerate vaccine development. Adults and children receive millions of doses of approved vaccines each year across the world, and severe reactions are extremely rare.In its phase one trials for the Moderna vaccine against COVID-19, four of 45 individuals who received the vaccine had a medically significant adverse reaction, including one man who developed a high fever and fainted. Yet researchers already knew that mRNA vaccines can sometimes overstimulate an immune system, and three of the four subjects who had these side effects were taking the highest dosage in the trial, which has now been discontinued.Assuming that a COVID-19 vaccine meets the WHO benchmarks, including that the “vaccine benefits outweigh safety risks,” an unknown share of the public still will need convincing to take the shot.In May, a survey of more than a thousand people conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that around 50 percent of respondents were certain they would take a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. That’s about the same proportion that the center has found in the past when it asked about taking the flu vaccine, and it matches the findings of a Pew Research Center Poll conducted around the same time.But there were a larger proportion of people not yet settled about getting immunized against COVID-19 than the flu: while 18 percent of those surveyed had said they were undecided about getting a flu shot, 31 percent said they had not made up their minds about whether they’d take a COVID-19 vaccine. Among those who say they might eschew a vaccine, twice as many people were worried about side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine as for one designed to prevent influenza.The survey also revealed a curious divergence by gender. “Women are more likely to be unsure and be on the fence,” says Jennifer Benz, deputy director of The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Its survey found 56 percent of men said they would take the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine, while only 43 percent of women said the same. “Women are oftentimes the healthcare decision makers in the household, so when you think about vaccinating the whole family and making healthcare decisions and appointments, it’s a potentially influential group,” Benz says.The key challenge for the future, as Laurens sees it, is to explain to people how they can do their part in stopping the pandemic by getting immunized once a suitable vaccine is available. “We have to do our utmost to educate the public about how vaccines are tested and the safety profiles of vaccines and what they can actually do, and how they can prevent disease in a community,” he says.Vaccine hesitancy might not be the only hurdle to overcome. Weller anticipates a scenario where—at least initially—public interest in obtaining the vaccine might outstrip the amount available.Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore says that there might be “chaotic” scenes if demand is high and the rollout is not done carefully “Just think about Black Friday and what happens when people are in lines,” he says, referring to the shopping day after Thanksgiving when crowds may become impatient and overwhelm stores.Coordinators of past immunization campaigns for other ailments are watching the COVID-19 vaccine development process closely, in hopes of heading off missteps that would undermine uptake and access. “It will not take much to discredit the vaccine in the eyes of the population,” Sutter says. “The rollout has to be carefully thought out so that it will not destroy confidence in the vaccine.”",
"Your kids probably won’t get too excited over an impromptu science lesson—unless it means mixing up an experiment they can eat. And it turns out lots of easy techniques that chefs use rely on STEM-ready concepts. We asked them to share their best science-based cooking secrets to help get food on the table and sneak in some academics.What they’ll learn about: ViscosityWhat they’ll do: Let the kids fill a clear measuring cup to what they think is one cup of any liquid. Place it on a flat surface and have them look at it at eye level. They’ll see that the liquid isn’t flat—it dips in the center. That’s the meniscus—the point where chemists measure liquids. Kids will discover that what looked like the right amount from above is actually more or less liquid than they thought.Cool Science: Viscosity is the resistance to flow; in other words, how thick is it? Something with a low viscosity has a lot of liquid—and that’s why measurements of liquids matter so much.Why you should try it: “Too much liquid will lower viscosity of a batter,” says professor Melani W. Duffrin of Northern Illinois University’s School of Interdisciplinary Health Professions. “So for instance, a pancake batter with low viscosity—or too much liquid—would spread more, resulting in a flatter product,” she says. But get the liquid measurement right, and those pancakes will plump right up.What they’ll learn about: OsmosisWhat they’ll do: With your help, have kids chop a tomato, then place the pieces in a mesh strainer over a bowl. Sprinkle with salt. As salt seeps into the tomato, water from the fruit will drip out.Cool Science: Water and other molecules pass through membranes via a process called osmosis. In this case, the membrane is the tomato's skin. The concentration of water and salt molecules must be equal inside and outside the tomato, so as salt flows in, water flows out.Why you should try it: Because of osmosis, salting vegetables draws out water. So if you salt, say, cucumbers or tomatoes before adding them to a salad bowl, you won’t wind up with a lot of liquid at the bottom of the bowl.What they’ll learn about: EmulsionWhat they’ll do: Have kids pour 1/3 cup vinegar and 1 cup oil into a mixing bowl, then whisk it together. In a separate bowl, add the same amount of vinegar and oil plus 1 1/2 tablespoon dijon mustard, and whisk together. Transfer the mixtures into two separate jars and watch the ingredients separate. “You should see the mustard mixture hold together longer,” says Daniel Gritzer, managing culinary director of Serious Eats, a website dedicated to recipes and cooking techniques. “If kids give each one a vigorous shaking, they can bring both of them back together.” Then one more time, observe which one separates quicker.Cool Science: The mustard contains lecithin, an emulsifier. Emulsifiers are compounds that possess both “hydrophilic” (water-loving) and “lipophilic” (fat-loving) properties. “The mustard emulsifier helps the water molecules in the vinegar hang out with the fat molecules in the oil,” Gritzer says. “That’s why the oil and vinegar doesn’t separate as quickly.”Why you should try it: Using an emulsifier means a much creamier vinaigrette for your salad.What they’ll learn about: Maillard reactionWhat they’ll do: Have kids wrap one piece of raw meat tightly in plastic and a similar-size piece on a wire rack over a plate to dry out. (Be sure kids wash hands thoroughly before and after handling raw meat.) Refrigerate both for at least an hour, then help them sear each piece separately in a skillet. The exposed piece will brown and crisp much more than the pre-wrapped piece, developing a richer taste.Cool Science: Heat causes sugar and protein molecules to combine and recombine, forming new molecules and distinct flavors. Called the Maillard reaction, it’s what gives browned foods like steak their rich taste. “New and more complex flavors come out as the reaction goes along,” Gritzer says.Why you should try it: Surface moisture takes time to cook off, so wetter meat is often done before the Maillard reaction can fully take effect. “But if you dry the meat before you cook, all those flavor compounds permeate it,” says chef Bertram Whitman of Los Angeles.What they’ll learn about: Crystal formationWhat they’ll do: Have kids weigh a half cup of table salt and a half cup of kosher salt on a food scale. Then check out both under a magnifier. The kosher salt crystals should weigh a little less and look larger.Cool Science: Salt crystals form when water with dissolved “solute”—that is, salt minerals—evaporates. All salt crystals naturally form a cube shape, but they’ll grow bigger or smaller depending on the evaporation speed. Water that evaporates slowly yields bigger salt crystals. “Your larger crystals are going to require more volume [ie, space] to acquire the same weight,” says Duffrin, creator of FoodMASTER, which teaches math and science using food experiments.Why you should try it: Weighing salt for a recipe could make the difference between something you want to eat and something you … don’t. Duffrin points out that one teaspoon of table salt is generally equivalent to 1 1/4 teaspoons of kosher salt.",
"For seven-year-old Emme, it’s all about the dragons.In the midst of the pandemic, Emme was bored—a sentiment she expressed freely and frequently. “Once she discovered dragons, it’s like she came to life again,” says Lizzie Goodman, a mother of two in Illinois. Emme would disappear in her room for hours, creating an encyclopedia of the creatures, full of detailed backstories and anatomical diagrams. “I’ll ask her to go upstairs and get changed, and then she’ll get sucked into this play,” Goodman laughs. “And I’ll have to pull her out and be like, ‘Come back.’”Before her dragon discovery, Emme was likely experiencing what experts have dubbed “languishing.”  “You’re not depressed,” clarifies Jeffrey Froh, a professor of psychology at Hofstra University, “but you’re definitely not functioning optimally.” And Emme is far from alone. Michelle Harris, a licensed clinical social worker based in New York and founder of Parenting Pathfinders, says that she’s seen more kids experiencing low motivation and difficulty focusing since the start of the pandemic.According to psychologists, people flourish when they feel engaged in life, have meaningful connections with others, and pursue goals that bring a sense of accomplishment and mastery. Unfortunately, these are the very conditions that were decimated by the pandemic, says David Shernoff, an educational psychologist at Rutgers University.Uncertainty and fear wrought by the pandemic also contributed to kids’ languishing. “Our sense of threat and safety is just on overdrive,” Froh says, making it difficult to pursue anything challenging. And if kids are affected directly, with loved ones getting sick; or if they’re worried about parents who have to go to work, then their motivation and energy can plummet.“For a lot of kids, the challenges, changes, and restrictions of the last year have been really emotionally taxing,” Harris says. “It’s sapped their joy and delight.”But as Emme discovered, there’s an antidote for languishing: flow. It’s a state of being immersed in a task or activity and has many of the hallmarks that make flourishing possible. Kids in flow are completely absorbed by what they’re doing, to the point in which they lose track of time or even physical needs like food and sleep.“We all have an innate desire to thrive,” Froh notes. “And encouraging flow states in our children helps them pursue and reach their potential.”So what’s going on in the brain of someone experiencing flow? As it turns out, quite a lot—but the picture is far from straightforward.Charles Limb, a surgeon and neuroscientist at the University of California in San Francisco, studied the neural activity of jazz musicians while they played piano and found that “broad areas of the prefrontal cortex [associated with self-monitoring] shut down when they're improvising.” At the same time, the parts of the brain responsible for “sensory processing and motor processing seem to increase [in activity] during creative tasks,” Limb says. Similar patterns have been observed in freestyle rap artists, comedians, and caricature artists.Put simply, the brain scans showed that when individuals were immersed in a flow activity, their self-consciousness disappeared but their awareness of the activity was heightened. A dancer in the grip of flow, for example, may not feel the ache in her muscles, but she’s hyper-attuned to the song that governs her movements.What might this mean for kids? Limb suspects that there are levels to flow states depending on the activity involved as well as the expertise of the person (for instance, a child who likes to draw versus a professional artist). In an ongoing study, Limb’s team examined the brain activity of musically untrained kids between the ages of 9 and 11 during improvisational play. Similar to his experiment with musicians, Limb compared the kids’ brain patterns while playing a memorized sequence versus a tune they were making up. The experimental setup was designed so that whatever note was struck, it never sounded wrong.“The kids’ brain activity was much more muted compared to the professional musicians,” Limb says. “It raises the interesting question of how the patterns in kids related to those of trained adults.”What is clear, however, is that “there’s a big difference in the brain when the kids go from memorizing to improvising,” or from rote exercises to activities they can become completely absorbed in. But the science continues to be refined.From a neurochemical perspective, dopamine—which mediates learning, memory, and emotional regulation—plays an important role in flow states. “Flow really taps into the brain’s dopaminergic circuits,” or the routes through which this neurotransmitter travels in the brain, says Joydeep Bhattacharya, a professor of psychology at the University of London. He speculates that the dopaminergic circuits of people who frequently achieve flow are “slowly reshaped and molded over time.”Regular bouts of flow, therefore, could boost both motivation to learn and the skills to manage emotions. In his research, Bhattacharya demonstrated a link between ability to slip into flow states and emotional intelligence in piano students (though he cautions the study shows correlation, not causation).As anyone who’s witnessed a child immersed in doodling or building the perfect tower can attest, “children have a natural and inherent tendency to experience flow,” according to Bhattacharya. But sometimes they need a nudge. Experts have a few tips for helping kids benefit from flow.Find what interests them. Because intrinsic motivation is so crucial to achieving flow, it’s important to find out what your child’s passions are. “Talk to kids about what they’re interested in,” Harris advises, adding that parents should encourage kids to come up with their own ideas rather than just telling them what they need to do. Once they assume some ownership, they’re more likely to stick with the activity. For parents of younger children, “feel free to suggest ideas if kids are struggling to come up with some of their own.”What’s considered a flow activity is highly dependent on the individual. “For kids, you have to find out what lights their fire,” Shernoff says. “The more they can reclaim these sorts of flow activities, the more they start building back motivation as well as meaning.”Provide uninterrupted time with no distractions. We live in an era of distractions and overstuffed schedules, both of which can kill flow. “Turn off the TV, find a space with limited distractions, and let kids know that this is a time for them to just do nothing but enjoy what they’re working on,” Harris says.Froh agrees: “Unstructured play, and lots of it, is imperative.” For instance, Froh’s 11-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son are limited to two extracurricular activities to ensure they have plenty of unstructured time to pursue their interests.Support and scaffold kids. Flow requires a tricky balance: The task needs to be difficult enough to sustain interest, but not so hard that the experience is discouraging. Parents should scaffold this balance by providing support in the beginning when kids need more help, then backing off as they gain confidence.With Legos, for example, you might start with a kit where “you’re following a recipe and know exactly what you’re going to be building,” Shernoff says. But as your child becomes more comfortable with the basics, you can build something new together. Don’t forget to ask questions: What color will the chimney be? Does this door open in or out? But let the child lead the way.Engaging in flow activities together is also a great way to connect with your kids, and when they feel connected to others—whether it’s family, friends, or mentors—that can also encourage flow and combat languishing. In Shernoff’s research on flow in schools, for example, he discovered that teacher and peer support led to stronger student engagement. “Sharing the flow experience with friends,” Shernoff says, “makes it meaningful and becomes a source of bonding.” And when friends and mentors provide immediate feedback, it helps kids reach (and exceed) their goals.De-emphasize performance. When parents focus on performance or outcomes, they could inadvertently dampen kids’ joy in the activity. “You don’t have to be Mozart to play the piano, and you don’t have to be Michael Jordan to shoot hoops,” Limb says. Instead, encourage kids to engage in activities that are a little more open-ended, without a lot of steps or rules that need to be followed. Create a comic book with no thoughts about publishing, or sing along to the soundtrack of a favorite movie.Ultimately, Limb believes that creativity is universal, though it requires training to refine. “When kids engage in these activities, they’re developing creativity in their brain,” he says. And the more kids tap into their creative nature through flow, the more likely it is that they’ll carry those skills into a productive adulthood.",
"After many days of scheduled quarantine activities for her eight- and six-year-old, Cindy Zibel of Bedford, New Hampshire, needed to accomplish some work from home. She wasn't sure how the kids would handle their unstructured time.After about 15 minutes of leaving her kids with nothing to do, she went to check. “I found them outside with bikes,” she says. "The older one had taken off the younger one’s training wheels and taught him to ride a two-wheeler.”Many parents have been full-time activity directors since stay-at-home orders were put in place this spring. That job is not likely to end soon, especially with summer starting, social distancing still in effect, and camps and sitters largely unavailable. Children are quick to say they’re bored when grown-ups aren’t ready with a packed day of planned activities. But would it be so bad if we just let the kids … be bored?Seemingly unlimited activities—especially now with video classes and digital activities—have likely been a lifesaver for many crazed parents. But all that planned stimulation can have negative effects on children. Overscheduled kids can feel irritable and overwhelmed, according to Shannon Barnett, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. “They may not be sleeping as well or be kind of anxious,” she says. “They might have stomachaches or other physical complaints. We see teens who’ve always been high achievers suddenly unable to meet expectations.”Although studies show that feeling bored most of the time might lead to risky behavior in children, research also indicates that sometimes feeling bored can actually be good for kids.A 2014 study in Creativity Research Journal found that when participants did a boring activity followed by a task, they showed more creativity in completing the task. And a 2019 study published in the Academy of Management Discoveries found that subjects who did a dull task first were able to come up with more creative ideas afterward than people who did an interesting task first.“We’re afraid of our kids turning around and saying, ‘Mom, I’m bored,’” says Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at University of Central Lancashire in England who co-authored the 2014 study. “Actually, we should be saying, ‘Job well done!' Because we need them to be bored. We need to capture their creativity and let them be creative.”Being bored is different from taking it easy, says Mann, who also wrote The Science of Boredom. “If you’re not stimulated but you’re happy, that’s just relaxation,” she says. “But if you’re not stimulated and you want more stimulation, that’s boredom.”When your kids are clamoring for something to do, so are their brains. “People’s brains are looking for a certain baseline level of stimulation, so when it’s bored, the brain tries to create stimulation,” says Sara L. Dolan, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco.A 2018 paper published in the National Academy of Sciences journal showed that when a kid’s brain is allowed to zone out, the problem-solving parts of the brain start communicating. And that nagging, negative feeling that results from being bored could be a good thing.“People come up with new ways to not be bored, which we then call ‘being creative,’” says Michael Scullin, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor.“When my kids complain they’re bored, I tell them I’m glad to hear it, that it’s good for their brains,” Barnett says. “Boredom gives them an opportunity to be creative and problem solve.”So how can you help your kids be a little bored?For starters, if a child is used to being constantly entertained, suddenly shutting everything off probably won’t go over well. “Kids will be frustrated,” says Barnett, adding that entertaining oneself is a learned skill, so some kids might take a little longer to catch on.But the good news is that it can be taught. She recommends starting out by using a timer—the one she used with her own kids played music until the time was up. “Giving kids the knowledge that it’s between this time and this time can help ease them in and avoid frustration,” she says.Barnett suggests starting kids with 30 minutes of nothing to do, but adds that the time really depends on the child. “If a kid is not successful with 30 minutes, then the time should be dropped down and gradually increased,” she says. Eventually, younger kids should be able to spend 90 minutes entertaining themselves; older kids, up to three hours a day.For younger kids, Barnett suggests offering a reward for spending self-directed time. “It could be getting to do something fun with parents, playing a preferred family game, or making a phone call to a particular person,” she says.Barnett and Mann also agree that you can offer a few activity suggestions. For kids who like to build, Barnett suggests going on a hunt together to find materials they can use. “This can include toys, boxes, tubes from paper towels or toilet paper, or things that you find outside,” she says. Or if you have a young artist, she suggests making a box of art supplies. “Things that can be glued to paper, including pasta, leaves, and flowers can be added,” she says. The “materials” can even be imaginary. “For kids who like pretend, help them start a story that they can continue on their own,” she says. “Maybe send them off on a magical quest.”Still, "Your hope shouldn’t be that your kids take your ideas, but use them as a jumping-off point,” Barnett says.Mann agrees. “Provide some interesting materials to build a den or whatever, but leave them to get on with it,” she says. "Because they will create their own fun and stimulation.”During this incredibly unstructured time, that can be relieving news for parents. And who knows where that’ll lead once things get back to normal? Says Barnett: “Parents might want to look and see—do we want to restart everything?”",
"Homemade cardamom bread sprinkled with pearl sugar is an annual treat in the DeRosa home in Cranston, Rhode Island. The family’s two young boys, 11 and 14, tell stories about their Granduncle Olof as it bakes: his family farm in New England, his cows, his truck, his big hands, and his recipe for bread, which he learned from his mother, who immigrated from Sweden.The DeRosa family found that making ancestral recipes like cardamon bread lifted the boys’ spirits when they started growing tired of homeschooling during the pandemic. It kept the boys motivated, says Family Dinner Project director Anne Fishel, who collects and studies stories like these."The pandemic is giving parents a chance to share memories [like family recipes] that are really important to them that they want their kids to remember,” says Fishel, who’s also a clinical psychologist and family therapist.In uncertain times, it makes sense to seek comfort in food and family. And the DeRosas aren’t alone. According to a study by the Hartman Group, 66 percent of Americans are cooking at home more than they did before the pandemic; 39 percent are baking more; and just over 30 percent are preparing food more frequently as a family.Making recipes that celebrate ancestry is a great way to keep the generations connected, especially now. The rituals and stories that are part of cooking help kids understand and appreciate their heritage. Plus, spending time together in the kitchen creates new memories and helps kids gain perspective on the pandemic.During the pandemic, Mai Uchida and her family in Watertown, Massachusetts, have been cooking heritage meals together like udon noodles, using colorful vegetables such as spinach and carrots to make “stomach paintings.” Uchida learned this idea when she was growing up in Japan, where her grandmother always said: “Eat as if you are painting a picture in your stomach.”This tip has come in handy as a way to encourage Uchida’s five-year-old son to eat his vegetables. But it’s also made him more curious about Japanese recipes. Plus, he’s developed independence during the pandemic by learning to make some ancestral foods on his own, like hand-rolled sushi.The rewards of learning about ancestry through recipes go beyond bonding at family dinners. It’s a way to strengthen kids’ sense of identity, says research psychologist Gail Ferguson, who directs the Culture and Family Life Lab at the University of Minnesota’s Institute of Child Development. “It’s really a positive thing for children and adolescents to connect to their cultural heritage, even if it’s distant,” Ferguson says. “Cooking can be a way to strengthen that.”Ferguson and her colleagues study a child development concept they call “remote enculturation,” which is connecting to a heritage culture when you’re far away from it. Ferguson is from Jamaica and implemented this practice when she was raising her kids in the United States.Cooking ancestral recipes, Ferguson notes, is one way to carry out remote enculturation. "You can see how that would be different than just going to a restaurant and buying the meal,” she says. “It would take a lot more engagement.”Ferguson says this connection to identity helps kids find meaning. She points to a study that shows how exploring heritage can lead to greater psychological well-being, a stronger sense of identity, and even better grades.“This has been shown to be true for youth from all racial backgrounds, youth of color, and also white youth in the United States,” she adds. “Parents should feel really good about helping their children connect to their heritage.”Connecting to heritage through food also helps kids build perspective and resilience during difficult times, Fishel says.“Family recipes show that we have this whole album of memories that predated the pandemic,” she says. “And we’ll have more after the pandemic.”Fishel cites research that shows kids who know their family stories are more resilient and have a more positive outlook on the future. They also see that others struggled with the same things they do (like eating their vegetables). “I think that’s because when kids know their family stories, they feel a part of something bigger than themselves,” Fishel says. "And they have a sense that their lives can go a lot of different ways, not just the way their parents’ lives have gone."Familial bonds are something Mēlani Douglass, who curated the new digital exhibition “Reclamation: Recipes, Remedies, and Rituals” at Washington, D.C.’s National Museum of Women in the Arts, tries to maintain by cooking with her nine-year-old daughter.As a third-generation Black herbalist, Douglass is teaching her daughter how to use herbs in the kitchen. Also, she keeps a batch of a family favorite in her fridge: a kale and collard salad, so they have a healthy source of greens. Spending time in the kitchen and garden keeps her daughter close to her roots instead of getting lost in the idea that she has to be “IG ready,” Douglass says. And when she and her daughter cook together, they don’t limit themselves to the family recipe.“We’re writing history right now,” Douglass says. “Every time you do a recipe—there is a part of it that becomes your own.”Ferguson explains that, when families are cooking ancestral recipes together, focusing only on the technicalities of a recipe misses the point of connecting to their culture. The most important part is to get kids to participate and learn about their ancestry while cooking."Focus on the experience,” Ferguson suggests. “Talk about the sights, experiences, sounds—because all of that is culture and all of that will make a difference to the developing identity of children and the family.”Aside from the long-term benefits of building identity, cooking family recipes can help create positive experiences during the pandemic, which can pay off now.“Anytime that kids experience hardship, having a connection to family is what keeps it from being a trauma,” Fishel explains. That’s why rituals, like cooking an ancestral recipe together each week, can help give both children and adults a sense of stability and continuity during the pandemic, she adds.You don’t need to have all the ingredients or equipment to get started cooking ancestral recipes. Follow Douglass’s advice and make it your own. Here are some ways to get started:Put it on the calendar. Make a heritage meal once a week, month, or season.Bond virtually. Ask grandparents to share a meaningful recipe, Fishel says. Set up a virtual cooking competition between cousins.Find ingredients from an ancestral country, or good substitutes. Look in local markets or shop online.Make a mini spice rack just for kids, Douglass suggests. Include spices from a heritage country to connect them with their culture.Teach children rituals that are related to family recipes. “A ritual has symbols and meaning,” Fishel explains, and that meaning creates a shared experience, even across generations.Encourage questions while cooking: Where do you think the spices in this recipe come from? Do the words in this recipe remind you of a specific language, culture, or place?Watch cooking shows that are specific to your family’s ethnic heritage, Ferguson advises. She and her kids watch a Caribbean cooking show to learn about Jamaican cuisine.Create a DIY cookbook with special recipes, rituals, stories, and images of heritage meals and ingredients to capture your family’s history in the making.",
"The stresses from everyday life can get to anyone—including children. But a varied and balanced diet can go a long way toward helping your family unwind.Yes, really.Most people have probably heard that serotonin, one of the body’s main hormones, is linked to mood and general happiness. But you might be surprised to hear that as much as 95 percent of this critical hormone is located in your gut—not in your brain.“Serotonin is produced in the GI tract,” says Jan Walker, a clinical nutrition specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “And those cells, if they’re bathed in the correct nutrients, will help produce better levels of serotonin.” And that can mean a better mood.Of course, your kids aren’t likely to care much about the location of a hormone they can’t pronounce or its levels. That’s why Walker relies on an easy-to-remember metaphor when talking with patients and their families.“If you had a really great car, you’d want to put good fuel in it, right?” she says.(Here’s an article about foods that can boost kids’ brainpower.)What’s more, relying on subpar energy can actually have a negative effect on body and brain performance. Although the research isn’t 100 percent conclusive, Walker says that trends show “diets that are high in refined sugar can impair brain function, and may even lead to increased depression.”Parents might be looking for a magic food bullet to help calm children. Don’t.“There is no single food that will relieve stress,” says Angel Planells, a registered dietary nutrition and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Our body needs and craves variety.”What parents can do is make sure kids are getting a healthy mix of vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, protein, and carbohydrates, as well as balancing hormones like serotonin. “That will help make sure that our body is performing to the best of its abilities while we all deal with fighting off the general stressors of life, as well as dealing with a pandemic,” Planells says.Here are some kid-friendly foods to help you do just that.THE FOOD: Dark chocolateWHY IT MATTERS: “Consuming dark chocolate has been shown to reduce the stress hormone cortisol,” Planells says. At the same time, compounds called flavanols may help relax blood vessels, improve blood flow, and decrease blood pressure, all of which benefit the heart.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: This will no doubt be the easiest sell on the list, but it’s not without pitfalls. Most kids are more accustomed to milk chocolate or white chocolate, which contain less of the good stuff, Planells says. (Milk chocolate also typically contains unhealthy ingredients such as butter and vegetable oils.) To help your kids develop a taste for the healthy stuff, try dipping fruit in dark chocolate or adding it to homemade peppermint bark.THE FOOD: Whole grainsWHY IT MATTERS: Carbohydrates are synonymous with comfort foods like pasta, bread, and many confections. Unfortunately, we often make such foods less healthy by using refined grains, like white flour, rather than whole grains. “But if we make some swaps, we can see a reduction in stress through feeling more satisfied, as it takes longer to digest and absorb complex carbohydrates,” Planells says, adding that whole grains help us “stabilize our blood sugar so we are less ‘hangry.’”HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: Simply choosing “whole grain” versions of your kids’ favorite foods, such as mac-’n’-cheese, crackers, or pasta is an easy way to get started. Those looking to take whole grains to the next level can try making oatmeal from scratch. “A warm cup of oatmeal can boost levels of serotonin,” Planells says, which can act as a calming chemical in the brain. And feel free to add lots of yummy extras, like fresh or dried fruit and bits of dark chocolate. You might also look for recipes that incorporate whole grains into traditional holiday foods, such as these cherry chocolate chip cookies.THE FOOD: Fruits and veggiesWHY IT MATTERS: Literally all the reasons! Bananas boost serotonin. Blueberries are bursting with antioxidants and vitamin C, which reduce cortisol levels and make them easy stress busters. Spinach, Swiss chard, pumpkin seeds, edamame, avocado, and potatoes are all good sources of magnesium, which reduces cortisol and promotes good sleeping patterns (which contributes to better mental health). Potassium-rich foods, such as oranges, cantaloupe, broccoli, sweet potatoes, peas, and cucumbers stabilize our blood pressure levels. And many veggies, like celery and carrots, provide the added bonus of making kids feel satisfied without filling their bellies up with junk.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: Trying mixing things up by combining different foods into flavor combos, Planells says, like apple slices slathered with peanut butter or veggie sticks with a side of hummus. New combinations may help them re-experience those foods and avoid a refusal to eat something that was a favorite just weeks earlier. Walker also suggests combining colors or arranging foods in visually inviting ways to keep things interesting. After all, who could resist a fruit menorah or a veggie Christmas tree?THE FOOD: FishWHY IT MATTERS: You’ve heard of “good fats,” right? Well, oily fishes are where it’s at. Not only are fish such as salmon excellent for general brain health, but Walker says research suggests omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D have been found to be helpful in reducing anxiety.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: Many parents may balk at the idea of even trying to get their kids to eat anchovies or sardines, but remember that plenty of cultures celebrate such foods. For instance, each December 24, many Italian-American families enjoy the Feast of the Seven Fishes. This meal can include everything from smelt and eel to squid and mussels. Likewise, some Jewish families serve fried fish during Hanukkah as a tribute to the everlasting oil that is fundamental to the origin story of the holiday. The point is, by normalizing a food your child isn’t familiar with, you can help them build a more inclusive diet as they grow older. If all else fails, cut tuna sandwiches into fun holiday shapes.THE FOOD: DairyWHY IT MATTERS: Trouble getting your kid to go to bed already? Try dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese. “Bedtime milk can help soothe your stress and bring on more restful sleep,” Planells says. Yogurt may also be a powerful source of probiotics, or beneficial, naturally occurring gut microbes, which more and more research is pointing toward as a critical component of whole-body health. “I would say in 10 years’ time, it will be all about the bugs, or probiotics,” Walker says.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: Milk and cookies are one way to go, of course. But you can also try getting your kids to chow down on protein-packed Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and nuts and a drizzle of honey. (Avoid the sugar-heavy yogurt varieties.) Hot cocoa hits the spot on a snowy afternoon; all you need is some milk and dark chocolate. Pro tip: Make enough for yourself—chances are, you need a little boost right now, too.",
"Everybody’s heard that eating carrots can help improve eyesight, or that calcium-rich milk is good for your teeth and bones. But what about the brain?“From a neuroscientist’s perspective, food is really fundamentally important for brain health, because our brains literally run on nutrients,” says Lisa Mosconi, director of the Weill Cornell Women’s Brain Initiative and author of Brain Food: The Surprising Science of Eating for Cognitive Power.Brains need different nutrients as they age, and early childhood is a particularly critical time for brain growth, development, and health.“Even just in the first few years of life, the brain is really sprouting neurons at light speed,” says Mosconi, who’s also a neuroscientist. “A baby’s brain has more neurons, more brain cells, than there are stars in the Milky Way.”Overall, scientists have found around 45 nutrients that are key to brain health, including things like protein, zinc, iron, choline, folate, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids.Of course, the words “folate” and “choline” aren’t likely to make anyone’s mouth water—children or otherwise—so the trick is to target the foods that are naturally rich in the good stuff. In addition to the foods listed below, consider adding to the menu oats, nuts, citrus fruits, beans, and vegetables of different colors.“Starting early is key,” says Claire McCarthy, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “If all a child has ever known is healthy foods, they’re far less likely to fight with their parents about eating them.”By targeting a few food groups and experimenting with new ways of preparing them, fueling your family’s brain growth can be easier than you might think.THE FOOD: BerriesWHY IT MATTERS: Even inexpensive and common berries like blackberries and blueberries are bursting with vitamin C, and though most people associate that nutrient with the immune system, the brain needs it too. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, says Mosconi, which means it plays a crucial role in neutralizing naturally occurring free radicals that cause damage to our DNA and cells.“It’s also important for the formation of neurotransmitters, the chemicals used for signaling in the nervous system,” Mosconi says. Without enough vitamin C, the integrity of many body tissues, brain included, start to weaken.Raspberries, dark cherries, mulberries, and goji berries are other superstars in this category. Berries also boast a good mix of natural sugars and fiber, which is important for the digestive system. (Read about the secrets of the brain.)HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: Berries are probably going to be the easiest sell on this list, but if you’re looking to switch things up, Mosconi recommends dipping berries in yogurt or even dark chocolate, which has its own brain benefits thanks to an essential amino acid called tryptophan. You might also freeze berries and blend them into a sorbet with a touch of lemon juice and maple syrup.THE FOOD: PlumsWHY IT MATTERS: This fruit, whether fresh or dried (called a prune) is a great source of tryptophan, an essential amino acid linked to a neurotransmitter called serotonin, which can help regulate mood. Keeping your child’s brain supplied with tryptophan will also help them sleep at night, when our brains rest and repair themselves. Chia seeds and raw cacao—the ingredient in dark chocolate—also contain tryptophan.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: With a lip-smacking combination of sweetness and tang, pureed prunes can be one of your baby’s first solid foods. As kids get older, whole plums are a fun alternative to apples in the lunchbox. Or you can get fancy and slice prunes down the middle and slather them in crunchy peanut butter for a healthy snack full of fiber and protein.THE FOOD: Sweet potatoesWHY IT MATTERS: If there was one food to focus on for children’s brain health, it would be dark leafy greens, says Mosconi, whose latest book is called The XX Brain: The Groundbreaking Science Empowering Women to Maximize Cognitive Health and Prevent Alzheimer's Disease. But she’s still honest: “Kids won’t eat them.” So instead, how about a tuber that’s naturally sweet, incredibly versatile, and packed full of another antioxidant known as vitamin A? This essential vitamin is important for general brain health, but a severe lack of it can actually hamper central nervous system development and function.HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: You can mash ’em. Bake ’em. Fry ’ em. Grill ’ em. Turn ’em into tots, tarts, latkes, or soups. The possibilities are endless.THE FOOD: FishWHY IT MATTERS: More than half of our brains are composed of fat, which should mean it’s a no-brainer that lipids would play a role in neurological health. But the kind of fats you eat matter. For instance, one type of omega-3 fat known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is extremely important for building nerve cells. These cells are responsible for healthy brain growth and development, as well as learning skills, Mosconi says. To get it, “you need to focus on cold-water fatty fish.” Some of the most DHA-rich fish are salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and herring, easily remembered with the acronym SMASH. (Get more kid-friendly recipes on Nat Geo Kids.)HOW TO GET KIDS EATING: With a young daughter herself, Mosconi often makes what she calls the “elevated fish stick.” First dip a fish filet in a bowl of egg, then into a bowl of finely crushed pistachios, almonds, breadcrumbs, and salt. Finish by sautéing in coconut or extra virgin olive oil. Of course, if your kiddo won’t touch one of the SMASH fish, it might help to get them used to the taste of fish with the regular old patties and sticks found in the freezer section. Tilapia and cod have healthy fatty acids, too, McCarthy says.She also has a parting piece of advice: Parents need to walk the walk as well.“Kids watch their parents and learn from them,” McCarthy says. “If you want your kids to eat healthy brain foods, you need to eat them too.”",
"Here’s something to wrap your mind around: The human brain is more complex than any other known structure in the universe. Weighing in at three pounds, on average, this spongy mass of fat and protein is made up of two overarching types of cells—called glia and neurons—and it contains many billions of each. Neurons are notable for their branch-like projections called axons and dendrites, which gather and transmit electrochemical signals. Different types of glial cells provide physical protection to neurons and help keep them, and the brain, healthy.Together, this complex network of cells gives rise to every aspect of our shared humanity. We could not breathe, play, love, or remember without the brain.The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, accounting for 85 percent of the organ's weight. The distinctive, deeply wrinkled outer surface is the cerebral cortex. It's the cerebrum that makes the human brain—and therefore humans—so formidable. Animals such as elephants, dolphins, and whales actually have larger brains, but humans have the most developed cerebrum. It's packed to capacity inside our skulls, with deep folds that cleverly maximize the total surface area of the cortex.The cerebrum has two halves, or hemispheres, that are further divided into four regions, or lobes. The frontal lobes, located behind the forehead, are involved with speech, thought, learning, emotion, and movement. Behind them are the parietal lobes, which process sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain. At the rear of the brain are the occipital lobes, dealing with vision. Lastly, there are the temporal lobes, near the temples, which are involved with hearing and memory.The second-largest part of the brain is the cerebellum, which sits beneath the back of the cerebrum. It plays an important role in coordinating movement, posture, and balance.The third-largest part is the diencephalon, located in the core of the brain. A complex of structures roughly the size of an apricot, its two major sections are the thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a relay station for incoming nerve impulses from around the body that are then forwarded to the appropriate brain region for processing. The hypothalamus controls hormone secretions from the nearby pituitary gland. These hormones govern growth and instinctual behaviors, such as when a new mother starts to lactate. The hypothalamus is also important for keeping bodily processes like temperature, hunger, and thirst balanced.Seated at the organ's base, the brain stem controls reflexes and basic life functions such as heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. It also regulates when you feel sleepy or awake and connects the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord.A brain is displayed at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. The human brain is a 3-pound (1.4-kilogram) mass of jelly-like fats and tissues—yet it's the most complex of all known living structures.The brain is extremely sensitive and delicate, and so it requires maximum protection, which is provided by the hard bone of the skull and three tough membranes called meninges. The spaces between these membranes are filled with fluid that cushions the brain and keeps it from being damaged by contact with the inside of the skull.Want more proof that the brain is extraordinary? Look no further than the blood-brain barrier. The discovery of this unique feature dates to the 19th century, when various experiments revealed that dye, when injected into the bloodstream, colored all of the body’s organs except the brain and spinal cord. The same dye, when injected into the spinal fluid, tinted only the brain and spinal cord.This led scientists to learn that the brain has an ingenious, protective layer. Called the blood-brain barrier, it’s made up of special, tightly bound cells that together function as a kind of semi-permeable gate throughout most of the organ. It keeps the brain environment safe and stable by preventing some toxins, pathogens, and other harmful substances from entering the brain through the bloodstream, while simultaneously allowing oxygen and vital nutrients to pass through.Of course, when a machine as finely calibrated and complex as the brain gets injured or malfunctions, problems arise. One in five Americans suffers from some form of neurological damage, a wide-ranging list that includes stroke, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy, as well as dementia.Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized in part by a gradual progression of short-term memory loss, disorientation, and mood swings, is the most common cause of dementia. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and the number of people diagnosed with it is growing. Worldwide, some 50 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s or some form of dementia. While there are a handful of drugs available to mitigate Alzheimer’s symptoms, there is no cure. Researchers across the globe continue to develop treatments that one day might put an end to the disease’s devasting effects.Far more common than neurological disorders, however, are conditions that fall under a broad category called mental illness. Unfortunately, negative attitudes toward people who suffer from mental illness are widespread. The stigma attached to mental illness can create feelings of shame, embarrassment, and rejection, causing many people to suffer in silence. In the United States, where anxiety disorders are the most common forms of mental illness, only about 40 percent of sufferers receive treatment. Anxiety disorders often stem from abnormalities in the brain’s hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is a mental health condition that also affects adults but is far more often diagnosed in children. ADHD is characterized by hyperactivity and an inability to stay focused. While the exact cause of ADHD has not yet been determined, scientists believe that it may be linked to several factors, among them genetics or brain injury. Treatment for ADHD may include psychotherapy as well as medications. The latter can help by increasing the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which are vital to thinking and focusing.Depression is another common mental health condition. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is often accompanied by anxiety. Depression can be marked by an array of symptoms, including persistent sadness, irritability, and changes in appetite. The good news is that in general, anxiety and depression are highly treatable through various medications—which help the brain use certain chemicals more efficiently—and through forms of therapy.",
"Using genetic engineering, a group of scientists have developed a way of sneaking a virus past the brain’s defences. Don’t panic – this isn’t some nightmare scenario. It could be the first step to curing a huge number of brain diseases.The brain seems incredibly well protected amid its shell of bone and cushioning fluid. But even the strongest of forts needs supply lines, and brain is no exception.A dense network of blood vessels carries vital oxygen to its cells. These vessels are a potential vulnerable spot, providing access for bacteria and other disease-causing organisms to migrate in from other body parts.But even these weak spots are heavily guarded. The blood vessels in the brain are lined with a tightly packed layer of cells that restrict the flow of molecules from blood to brain. These cells form a protective shield called the blood-brain barrier, or BBB.It is a superb defence but it can do its job too well. Not only does it block out dangerous microbes, but it can also exclude large proteins and drugs designed to treat brain diseases. Usually, these large molecules need to be distributed throughout the entire brain to be effective. With the BBB in the way, they don’t stand a chance. Now, Brian Spencer and Inder Verma from the Salk Institute of Biological Studies have come up with a way to disguise helpful molecules to sneak them past the brain’s defencesTheir method exploits special gates in the barrier that control the import of essential nutrients and molecules like cholesterol into the brain. These molecules are escorted by a large protein called apoliprotein B (apoB), and are presented to sentinel proteins that guard the gates.One of these guardians, called LDLR, is designed to recognise a specific segment of apoB. Once it has confirmed the visitor’s identity, it escorts apoB and the molecules it accompanies through the barrier. The whole system works with the tight control of a maximum security prison.Spencer and Verma managed to fool the system. They took the part of apoB that is recognised by LDLR and stuck it to various proteins, giving them the molecular equivalent of a fake pass.First, they tested their method in mice. They injected the animals with a harmless virus designed to travel to its liver and spleen. There, the virus sets about building the disguised protein, which is secreted en masse into the bloodstream.The beauty of this method is that it works after a single injection that transforms the liver and spleen into factories for the protein of choice.Their first candidate was GFP, a jellyfish protein that glows in the dark with a greenish hue, allowing it to be easily tracked. Sure enough, the injected mice soon gave off a greenish glow from their brains and the rest of their central nervous systems.Better still, their method showed real practical potential by sneaking an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (right) into the brain. Glucocerebrosidase is vital for the storage of fats. People who lack it suffer form a condition called Gaucher’s disease, where fatty desposits collect on various organs and cause brain damage, among other symptoms.The disease is relatively easy to fix using regular injections, but the resulting brain damage is not for the injected enzyme is usually repelled by the blood-brain barrier. But Spencer and Verma’s method may change all that.The duo fully admit that their work is merely a first step, but it is an important one nonetheless. The technique must first be refined and tested in people before it can be widely used. Developing drugs and proteins for treating brain disorders is pointless if those new medicines just congregate uselessly outside the blood-brain barrier. Spencer and Verma may have given them a way in.Reference: Spencer & Verma. 2007. Targeted delivery of proteins across the blood-brain barrier. PNAS 104: 7594-7599.Subscribe to the feed",
"When you head out to the desert, David Strayer is the kind of man you want behind the wheel. He never texts or talks on the phone while driving. He doesn’t even approve of eating in the car. A cognitive psychologist at the University of Utah who specializes in attention, Strayer knows our brains are prone to mistakes, especially when we’re multitasking and dodging distractions. Among other things, his research has shown that using a cell phone impairs most drivers as much as drinking alcohol does.Strayer is in a unique position to understand what modern life does to us. An avid backpacker, he thinks he knows the antidote: Nature.On the third day of a camping trip in the wild canyons near Bluff, Utah, Strayer is mixing up an enormous iron kettle of chicken enchilada pie while explaining what he calls the “three-day effect” to 22 psychology students. Our brains, he says, aren’t tireless three-pound machines; they’re easily fatigued. When we slow down, stop the busywork, and take in beautiful natural surroundings, not only do we feel restored, but our mental performance improves too. Strayer has demonstrated as much with a group of Outward Bound participants, who performed 50 percent better on creative problem-solving tasks after three days of wilderness backpacking. The three-day effect, he says, is a kind of cleaning of the mental windshield that occurs when we’ve been immersed in nature long enough. On this trip he’s hoping to catch it in action, by hooking his students—and me—to a portable EEG, a device that records brain waves.“On the third day my senses recalibrate—I smell things and hear things I didn’t before,” Strayer says. The early evening sun has saturated the red canyon walls; the group is mellow and hungry in that satisfying, campout way. Strayer, in a rumpled T-shirt and with a slight sunburn, is definitely looking relaxed. “I’m more in tune with nature,” he goes on. “If you can have the experience of being in the moment for two or three days, it seems to produce a difference in qualitative thinking.”Strayer’s hypothesis is that being in nature allows the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s command center, to dial down and rest, like an overused muscle. If he’s right, the EEG will show less energy coming from “midline frontal theta waves”—a measure of conceptual thinking and sustained attention. He’ll compare our brain waves with those of similar volunteers who are sitting in a lab or hanging out at a parking lot in downtown Salt Lake City.While the enchiladas are cooking, Strayer’s graduate students tuck my head into a sort of bathing cap with 12 electrodes embedded in it. They suction-cup another 6 electrodes to my face. Wires sprouting from them will send my brain’s electrical signals to a recorder for later analysis. Feeling like a beached sea urchin, I walk carefully to a grassy bank along the San Juan River for ten minutes of restful contemplation. I’m supposed to think of nothing in particular, just watch the wide, sparkling river flow gently by. I haven’t looked at a computer or cell phone in days. It’s easy to forget for a few moments that I ever had them.In 1865 the great landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted looked out over the Yosemite Valley and saw a place worth saving. He urged the California legislature to protect it from rampant development. Olmsted had already designed Central Park in New York City; he was convinced that beautiful green spaces should exist for all people to enjoy. “It is a scientific fact,” he wrote, “that the occasional contemplation of natural scenes of an impressive character ... is favorable to the health and vigor of men and especially to the health and vigor of their intellect.”Olmsted was exaggerating; his claim was based less on science than on intuition. But it was an intuition with a long history. It went back at least to Cyrus the Great, who some 2,500 years ago built gardens for relaxation in the busy capital of Persia. Paracelsus, the 16th-century German-Swiss physician, gave voice to that same intuition when he wrote, “The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician.” In 1798, sitting on the banks of the River Wye, William Wordsworth marveled at how “an eye made quiet by the power / Of harmony” offered relief from “the fever of the world.” American writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and John Muir inherited that outlook. Along with Olmsted, they built the spiritual and emotional case for creating the world’s first national parks by claiming that nature had healing powers.There wasn’t much hard evidence then—but there is now. Motivated by large-scale public health problems such as obesity, depression, and pervasive nearsightedness, all clearly associated with time spent indoors, Strayer and other scientists are looking with renewed interest at how nature affects our brains and bodies. Building on advances in neuroscience and psychology, they’ve begun to quantify what once seemed divine and mysterious. These measurements—of everything from stress hormones to heart rate to brain waves to protein markers—indicate that when we spend time in green space, “there is something profound going on,” as Strayer puts it.In England researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School recently analyzed mental health data from 10,000 city dwellers and used high-resolution mapping to track where the subjects had lived over 18 years. They found that people living near more green space reported less mental distress, even after adjusting for income, education, and employment (all of which are also correlated with health). In 2009 a team of Dutch researchers found a lower incidence of 15 diseases—including depression, anxiety, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and migraines—in people who lived within about a half mile of green space. And in 2015 an international team overlaid health questionnaire responses from more than 31,000 Toronto residents onto a map of the city, block by block. Those living on blocks with more trees showed a boost in heart and metabolic health equivalent to what one would experience from a $20,000 gain in income. Lower mortality and fewer stress hormones circulating in the blood have also been connected to living close to green space.It’s difficult to tell from these kinds of studies why people feel better. Is it the fresh air? Do certain colors or fractal shapes trigger neurochemicals in our visual cortex? Or is it just that people in greener neighborhoods use the parks to exercise more? That’s what Richard Mitchell, an epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, thought at first. “I was skeptical,” he says. But then he did a large study that found less death and disease in people who lived near parks or other green space—even if they didn’t use them. “Our own studies plus others show these restorative effects whether you’ve gone for walks or not,” Mitchell says. Moreover, the lowest income people seemed to gain the most: In the city, Mitchell found, being close to nature is a social leveler.What he and other researchers suspect is that nature works primarily by lowering stress. Compared with people who have lousy window views, those who can see trees and grass have been shown to recover faster in hospitals, perform better in school, and even display less violent behavior in neighborhoods where it’s common. Such results jibe with experimental studies of the central nervous system. Measurements of stress hormones, respiration, heart rate, and sweating suggest that short doses of nature—or even pictures of the natural world—can calm people down and sharpen their performance.In Sweden physician Matilda van den Bosch found that after a stressful math task, subjects’ heart rate variability—which decreases with stress—returned to normal more quickly when they sat through 15 minutes of nature scenes and birdsong in a 3-D virtual reality room than when they sat in a plain room. A real-life experiment is under way at the Snake River Correctional Institution in eastern Oregon. Officers there report calmer behavior in solitary confinement prisoners who exercise for 40 minutes several days a week in a “blue room” where nature videos are playing, compared with those who exercise in a gym without videos. “I thought it was crazy at first,” says corrections officer Michael Lea. But he has experienced the difference. “There’s a lot of yelling really loud— it echoes horribly,” in the plain gym, he says. “In the blue room they tend not to yell. They say, ‘Hold on, I got to watch my video.’”A 15-minute walk in the woods causes measurable changes in physiology. Japanese researchers led by Yoshifumi Miyazaki at Chiba University sent 84 subjects to stroll in seven different forests, while the same number of volunteers walked around city centers. The forest walkers hit a relaxation jackpot: Overall they showed a 16 percent decrease in the stress hormone cortisol, a 2 percent drop in blood pressure, and a 4 percent drop in heart rate. Miyazaki believes our bodies relax in pleasant, natural surroundings because they evolved there. Our senses are adapted to interpret in- formation about plants and streams, he says, not traffic and high-rises.All this evidence for the benefits of nature is pouring in at a time when disconnection from it is pervasive, says Lisa Nisbet, a psychology professor at Canada’s Trent University. We love our state and national parks, but per capita visits have been declining since the dawn of email. So have visits to the backyard. One recent Nature Conservancy poll found that only about 10 percent of American teens spend time outside every day. According to research by the Harvard School of Public Health, American adults spend less time outdoors than they do inside vehicles—less than 5 percent of their day.“People underestimate the happiness effect” of being outdoors, Nisbet says. “We don’t think of it as a way to increase happiness. We think other things will, like shopping or TV. We evolved in nature. It’s strange we’d be so disconnected.” But some people are starting to do something about it.Nooshin Razani at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California, is one of several doctors who have noticed the emerging data on nature and health. As part of a pilot project, she’s training pediatricians in the outpatient clinic to write prescriptions for young patients and their families to visit nearby parks. It’s not as simple as taking a pill. To guide the physicians and patients into a new mind-set, she says, “we have transformed the clinical space so nature is everywhere. There are maps on the wall, so it’s easy to talk about where to go, and pictures of local wilderness, which are healing to look at for both the doctor and patient.” The hospital is partnering with the East Bay Regional Parks District to provide transportation to parks and programs there for entire families.In some countries governments are promoting nature experiences as a public health policy. In Finland, a country that struggles with high rates of depression, alcoholism, and suicide, government-funded researchers asked thousands of people to rate their moods and stress levels after visiting both natural and urban areas. Based on that study and others, Professor Liisa Tyrväinen and her team at the Natural Resources Institute Finland recommend a minimum nature dose of five hours a month—several short visits a week—to ward off the blues. “A 40- to 50-minute walk seems to be enough for physiological changes and mood changes and probably for attention,” says Kalevi Korpela, a professor of psychology at the University of Tampere. He has helped design a half dozen “power trails” that encourage walking, mindfulness, and reflection. Signs on them say things like, “Squat down and touch a plant.”Perhaps no one has embraced the medicalization of nature with more enthusiasm than the South Koreans. Many suffer from work stress, digital addiction, and intense academic pressures. More than 70 percent say their jobs, which require notoriously long hours, make them depressed, according to a survey by electronics giant Samsung. Yet this economically powerful nation has a long history of worshipping nature spirits. The ancient proverb “Shin to bul ee—Body and soil are one” (not body and soul) is still popular.At the Saneum Healing Forest, east of Seoul, a “health ranger” offers me elm bark tea, then takes me on a hike along a small creek, through shimmering red maples, oaks, and pine-nut trees. It’s autumn, and the changing foliage and crisp air have lured scores of urban refugees to the woods. Soon we come upon a cluster of wooden platforms arranged in a clearing. Forty middle-aged firefighters who have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder are paired off on the platforms as part of a free three-day program sponsored by the local government. In North America groups of men in the woods likely would be hunting or fishing, but here, after a morning of hiking, they practice partner yoga, rub lavender massage oil into each other’s forearms, and make delicate dried flower collages. Among them is Kang Byoung-wook, a weathered 46-year-old from Seoul. Recently returned from a big fire in the Philippines, he looks exhausted. “It’s a stressed life,” he says. “I want to live here for a month.”Saneum is one of three official healing forests in South Korea, but 34 more are planned by 2017, meaning most major towns will be near one. Chungbuk University offers a “forest healing” degree program, and job prospects for graduates are good; the Korea Forest Service expects to appoint 500 health rangers in the next couple of years. It’s a cradle-to-grave operation: Programs include everything from prenatal forest meditation to woodcrafts for cancer patients to forest burials. A government-run “happy train” takes kids who’ve been bullied into the woods for two days of camping. A hundred-million-dollar healing complex is under construction next to Sobaeksan National Park.Korea Forest Service scientists used to study timber yields; now they also distill essential oils from trees such as the hinoki cypress and study them for their ability to reduce stress hormones and asthma symptoms. In the new industrial city of Deajun, I pay a visit to the forest minister, Shin Won Sop, a social scientist who has studied the effects of forest therapy on alcoholics. Human well-being, he tells me, is now a formal goal of the nation’s forest plan. Thanks to the new policies, visitors to Korea’s forests increased from 9.4 million in 2010 to 12.8 million in 2013.“Of course we still use forests for timber,” Shin says. “But I think the health area is the fruit of the forest right now.” His agency has data suggesting that forest healing reduces medical costs and benefits local economies. What’s still needed, he says, is better data on specific diseases and on the natural qualities that make a difference. “What are the main factors in the forest that are most responsible for the physiological benefits, and what types of forests are more effective?” Shin asks.My own city brain, which spends much of the year in Washington, D.C., seems to like the Utah wilderness very much. By day, on David Strayer’s camping trip, we hike among flowering prickly pear cacti; by night we sit around the campfire. Strayer’s students seem more relaxed and sociable than they do in the classroom, he says, and they give much better presentations. What’s going on inside their brains and mine?A lot of different things, judging from the neuroscience research that’s starting to come in. Korean researchers used functional MRI to watch brain activity in people viewing different images. When the volunteers were looking at urban scenes, their brains showed more blood flow in the amygdala, which processes fear and anxiety. In contrast, the natural scenes lit up the anterior cingulate and the insula—areas associated with empathy and altruism. Maybe nature makes us nicer as well as calmer.It may also make us nicer to ourselves. Stanford researcher Greg Bratman and his colleagues scanned the brains of 38 volunteers before and after they walked for 90 minutes, either in a large park or on a busy street in downtown Palo Alto. The nature walkers, but not the city walkers, showed decreased activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex—a part of the brain tied to depressive rumination—and from their own reports, the nature walkers beat themselves up less. Bratman believes that being outside in a pleasant environment (not the kind where you’re getting eaten alive by gnats or pummeled by hail) takes us outside of ourselves in a good way. Nature, he says, may influence “how you allocate your attention and whether or not you focus on negative emotions.”Strayer is most interested in how nature affects higher order problem solving. His research builds on the attention restoration theory proposed by environmental psychologists Stephen and Rachel Kaplan at the University of Michigan. They argue that it’s the visual elements in natural environments—sunsets, streams, butterflies—that reduce stress and mental fatigue. Fascinating but not too demanding, such stimuli promote a gentle, soft focus that allows our brains to wander, rest, and recover from what Olmsted called the “nervous irritation” of city life. “Soft fascination ... permits a more reflective mode,” wrote the Kaplans—and the benefit seems to carry over when we head back indoors.A few years ago, for example, in an experiment similar to Bratman’s, Stephen Kaplan and his colleagues found that a 50-minute walk in an arboretum improved executive attention skills, such as short-term memory, while walking along a city street did not. “Imagine a therapy that had no known side effects, was readily available, and could improve your cognitive functioning at zero cost,” the researchers wrote in their paper. It exists, they continued, and it’s called “interacting with nature.”A few months after our Utah trip, Strayer’s team sent me the results of my EEG test. The colorful graph charted the power of my brain waves at a range of frequencies and compared them with samples from the two groups that had stayed in the city. My theta signals were indeed lower than theirs; the soft fascination of the San Juan River had apparently quieted my prefrontal cortex, at least for a while.So far, says Strayer, the results are consistent with his hypothesis. But even if the study bears it out, it won’t offer anything like a full explanation of the brain-on-nature experience. Something mysterious will always remain, Strayer says, and maybe that’s as it should be. “At the end of the day,” he says, “we come out in nature not because the science says it does something to us, but because of how it makes us feel.”",
"As U.S. surgeon general from 2014 until spring 2017, Vivek Murthy, 40, extended his office’s public health advocacy to matters such as reliable transportation, safe neighborhoods, and affordable housing. Now, he continues to push to reduce stigmas around mental illness and to promote emotional well-being and healthy habits. He spoke to National Geographic.When I began my tenure as surgeon general, I did not intend to focus on emotional well-being. But it became a priority after I traveled the country listening to people in small towns and big cities. What I sensed was that people were experiencing a high degree of emotional pain. I think of emotional well-being as a resource within each of us that allows us to do more and to perform better. That doesn’t mean just the absence of mental illness. It’s the presence of positive emotions that allows us to be resilient in the face of adversity.The first thing is that we need to change how we think about emotions. Emotions are a source of power, and that’s what science tells us. But many people I encounter have been led to think of emotions as a source of weakness. The second thing we have to do is cultivate emotional well-being. There are tools, and they’re relatively simple. They include sleep, physical activity, contemplative practices like gratitude and meditation, and social connection as well.I am deeply concerned about the level of stress that our country is experiencing. I think it’s preventing us from achieving our full potential. I have long believed that there are fundamentally two forces or emotions that drive our decisions— love and fear. Love has its many manifestations: compassion, gratitude, kindness, and joy. Fear often manifests in cynicism, anger, jealousy, and anxiety. I worry that many of our communities are being driven by fear. It’s partly because of the things we read about in the news that give us pause about the state of the world. And it’s also because we haven’t really prioritized cultivating positive emotions that emanate from love.",
"Once food is swallowed, it passes through the esophagus into the stomach, the pink organ shown here above the yellow pancreas. A large, muscular chamber, the stomach produces digestive juices like pepsin, lipase, and hydrochloric acid, which digest and dissolve stomach contents.The digestive system is the series of tubelike organs that convert our meals into body fuel. There are about 30 feet (9 meters) of these convoluted pipeworks, starting with the mouth and ending with the anus. Along the way, food is broken down, sorted, and reprocessed before being circulated around the body to nourish and replace cells and supply energy to our muscles.Food on the plate must be converted into a mashed-up, gooey liquid for the digestive system to be able to split it up into its constituent parts: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Our teeth start the process by chewing and grinding up each mouthful, while the tongue works it into a ball-shaped bolus for swallowing.Moistening saliva fed into the mouth from nearby glands starts the process of chemical digestion using specialized proteins called enzymes. Secreted at various points along the digestive tract, enzymes break down large molecules of food into smaller molecules that the body is able to absorb.Once we swallow, digestion becomes involuntary. Food passes down the throat to the esophagus, the first of a succession of hollow organs that transport their contents through muscular contractions known as peristalsis.The esophagus empties into the stomach, a large, muscular chamber that mixes food up with digestive juices including the enzyme pepsin, which targets proteins, and lipase, which works on fats. Hydrochloric acid likewise helps to dissolve the stomach contents while killing potentially harmful bacteria. The resulting semifluid paste—chyme—is sealed in the stomach by two ringlike sphincter muscles for several hours and then released in short bursts into the duodenum.The first of three sections of the small intestine, the duodenum, produces large quantities of mucus to protect the intestinal lining from acid in the chyme.Measuring about 20 feet (6 meters) in length, the small intestine is where the major digestion and absorption of nutrients take place. These nutrients are taken into the bloodstream, via millions of tiny, fingerlike projections called villi, and transported to the liver.What's left in the digestive tract passes into the large intestine, where it's eaten by billions of harmless bacteria and mixed with dead cells to form solid feces. Water is reabsorbed into the body while the feces are moved into the rectum to await expulsion.Other organs that play a key role in digestion include the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. The pancreas is a gland organ located behind the stomach that manufactures a cocktail of enzymes that are pumped into the duodenum. A duct also connects the duodenum to the gallbladder. This pear-shaped sac squeezes out green-brown bile, a waste product collected from the liver that contains acids for dissolving fatty matter.The liver itself is the body's main chemical factory, performing hundreds of different functions. It processes nutrients absorbed into the blood by the small intestine, creating energy-giving glycogen from sugary carbohydrates and converting dietary proteins into new proteins needed for our blood. These are then stored or released as needed, as are essential vitamins and minerals. The liver also breaks down unwanted chemicals, such as any alcohol consumed, which is detoxified and passed from the body as waste.",
"Van Wedeen strokes his half-gray beard and leans toward his computer screen, scrolling through a cascade of files. We’re sitting in a windowless library, surrounded by speckled boxes of old letters, curling issues of scientific journals, and an old slide projector that no one has gotten around to throwing out.“It’ll take me a moment to locate your brain,” he says.On a hard drive Wedeen has stored hundreds of brains—exquisitely detailed 3-D images from monkeys, rats, and humans, including me. Wedeen has offered to take me on a journey through my own head.“We’ll hit all the tourist spots,” he promises, smiling.This is my second trip to the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, located in a former ship-rope factory on Boston Harbor. The first time, a few weeks ago, I offered myself as a neuroscientific guinea pig to Wedeen and his colleagues. In a scanning room I lay down on a slab, the back of my head resting in an open plastic box. A radiologist lowered a white plastic helmet over my face. I looked up at him through two eyeholes as he screwed the helmet tight, so that the 96 miniature antennas it contained would be close enough to my brain to pick up the radio waves it was about to emit. As the slab glided into the cylindrical maw of the scanner, I thought of The Man in the Iron Mask.The magnets that now surrounded me began to rumble and beep. For an hour I lay still, eyes closed, and tried to keep myself calm with my own thoughts. It wasn’t easy. To squeeze as much resolution as possible out of the scanner, Wedeen and his colleagues had designed the device with barely enough room for a person of my build to fit inside. To tamp down the panic, I breathed smoothly and transported myself to places in my memory, at one point recalling how I had once walked my nine-year-old daughter to school through piles of blizzard snow.As I lay there, I reflected on the fact that all of these thoughts and emotions were the creation of the three-pound loaf of flesh that was under scrutiny: my fear, carried by electrical impulses converging in an almond-shaped chunk of tissue in my brain called the amygdala, and the calming response to it, marshaled in regions of my frontal cortex. My memory of my walk with my daughter was coordinated by a seahorse-shaped fold of neurons called the hippocampus, which reactivated a vast web of links throughout my brain that had first fired when I had clambered over the snowbanks and formed those memories.I was submitting to this procedure as part of my cross-country reporting to chronicle one of the great scientific revolutions of our times: the stunning advances in understanding the workings of the human brain. Some neuroscientists are zooming in on the fine structure of individual nerve cells, or neurons. Others are charting the biochemistry of the brain, surveying how our billions of neurons produce and employ thousands of different kinds of proteins. Still others, Wedeen among them, are creating in unprecedented detail representations of the brain’s wiring: the network of some 100,000 miles of nerve fibers, called white matter, that connects the various components of the mind, giving rise to everything we think, feel, and perceive. The U.S. government is throwing its weight behind this research through the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. In an announcement last spring President Barack Obama said that the large-scale project aimed to speed up the mapping of our neural circuitry, “giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action.”As they see the brain in action, neuroscientists can also see its flaws. They are starting to identify differences in the structure of ordinary brains and brains of people with disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease. As they map the brain in greater detail, they may learn how to diagnose disorders by their effect on anatomy, and perhaps even understand how those disorders arise.On my return trip to his lab Wedeen finally locates the image from my session in the scanner. My brain appears on his screen. His technique, called diffusion spectrum imaging, translates radio signals given off by the white matter into a high-resolution atlas of that neurological Internet. His scanner maps bundles of nerve fibers that form hundreds of thousands of pathways carrying information from one part of my brain to another. Wedeen paints each path a rainbow of colors, so that my brain appears as an explosion of colorful fur, like a psychedelic Persian cat.Wedeen focuses in on particular pathways, showing me some of the circuitry important to language and other kinds of thought. Then he pares away most of the pathways in my brain, so that I can more easily see how they’re organized. As he increases the magnification, something astonishing takes shape before me. In spite of the dizzying complexity of the circuits, they all intersect at right angles, like the lines on a sheet of graph paper.“It’s all grids,” says Wedeen.When Wedeen first unveiled the grid structure of the brain, in 2012, some scientists were skeptical, wondering if he’d uncovered only part of a much more tangled anatomy. But Wedeen is more convinced than ever that the pattern is meaningful. Wherever he looks—in the brains of humans, monkeys, rats—he finds the grid. He notes that the earliest nervous systems in Cambrian worms were simple grids—just a pair of nerve cords running from head to tail, with runglike links between them. In our own lineage the nerves at the head end exploded into billions but still retained that gridlike structure. It’s possible that our thoughts run like streetcars along these white matter tracks as signals travel from one region of the brain to another.“There’s zero chance that there are not principles lurking in this,” says Wedeen, peering intently at the image of my brain. “We’re just not yet in a position to see the simplicity.”Scientists are learning so much about the brain now that it’s easy to forget that for much of history we had no idea at all how it worked or even what it was. In the ancient world physicians believed that the brain was made of phlegm. Aristotle looked on it as a refrigerator, cooling off the fiery heart. From his time through the Renaissance, anatomists declared with great authority that our perceptions, emotions, reasoning, and actions were all the result of “animal spirits”—mysterious, unknowable vapors that swirled through cavities in our head and traveled through our bodies.The scientific revolution in the 17th century began to change that. The British physician Thomas Willis recognized that the custardlike tissue of the brain was where our mental world existed. To understand how it worked, he dissected brains of sheep, dogs, and expired patients, producing the first accurate maps of the organ.It would take another century for researchers to grasp that the brain is an electric organ. Instead of animal spirits, voltage spikes travel through it and out into the body’s nervous system. Still, even in the 19th century scientists knew little about the paths those spikes followed. The Italian physician Camillo Golgi argued that the brain was a seamless connected web. Building on Golgi’s research, the Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal tested new ways of staining individual neurons to trace their tangled branches. Cajal recognized what Golgi did not: that each neuron is a distinct cell, separate from every other one. A neuron sends signals down tendrils known as axons. A tiny gap separates the ends of axons from the receiving ends of neurons, called dendrites. Scientists would later discover that axons dump a cocktail of chemicals into the gap to trigger a signal in the neighboring neuron.Jeff Lichtman, a neuroscientist, is the current Ramón y Cajal Professor of Arts and Sciences at Harvard, carrying Cajal’s project into the 21st century. Instead of making pen-and-ink drawings of neurons stained by hand, he and his colleagues are creating extremely detailed three-dimensional images of neurons, revealing every bump and stalk branching from them. By burrowing down to the fine structure of individual nerve cells, they may finally get answers to some of the most basic questions about the nature of the brain. Each neuron has on average 10,000 synapses. Is there some order to their connections to other neurons, or are they random? Do they prefer linking to one type of neuron over others?To produce the images, Lichtman and his colleagues load pieces of preserved mouse brain into a neuroanatomical version of a deli meat slicer, which pares off layers of tissue, each less than a thousandth the thickness of a strand of human hair. The scientists use an electron microscope to take a picture of each cross section, then use a computer to order them into a stack. Slowly a three-dimensional image takes shape—one that the scientists can explore as if they were in a submarine traveling through an underwater kelp forest.“Everything is revealed,” says Lichtman.The only problem is the sheer enormity of “everything.” So far the largest volume of a mouse’s brain that Lichtman and his colleagues have managed to re-create is about the size of a grain of salt. Its data alone total a hundred terabytes, the amount of data in about 25,000 high-definition movies.Once the scientists have gathered this information, the really hard work begins: looking for the rules that organize the brain’s seeming chaos. Recently Lichtman’s postdoctoral researcher Narayanan Kasthuri set out to analyze every detail in a cylinder of mouse brain tissue measuring just a thousand cubic microns—a volume 1/100,000 the size of a grain of salt. He selected a region surrounding a short segment of a single axon, seeking to identify every neuron that passed through it.That minuscule patch of brain turned out to be like a barrel of seething snakes. Kasthuri found a thousand axons and about 80 dendrites, each making about 600 connections with other neurons inside the cylinder. “It’s a wake-up call to how much more complicated brains are than the way we think about them,” says Lichtman.Complicated, but not random. Lichtman and Kasthuri discovered that every neuron made nearly all its connections with just one other one, scrupulously avoiding a connection with almost all the other neurons packed tightly around it. “They seem to care who they’re connected to,” Lichtman says.Lichtman can’t say yet whether this fastidious pattern is a general rule or a feature of just the tiny area of mouse brain he sampled. Even as they scale up the technology, he and his colleagues will need another two years to complete a scan of all 70 million neurons in a mouse. I ask about scanning an entire human brain, which contains a thousand times more neurons than a mouse’s.“I don’t dwell on that,” he says, with a laugh. “It’s too painful.”When and if Lichtman completes his three-dimensional portrait of the brain, it will reveal much—but it will still be only an exquisitely detailed sculpture. His imaged neurons are hollow models; real neurons are crammed with living DNA, proteins, and other molecules. Each type of neuron uses a distinct set of genes to build the molecular machinery it needs to do its own job. Light-sensitive neurons in the eyes produce photon-catching proteins, for example, and neurons in a region called the substantia nigra produce dopamine, crucial to our sense of reward. The geography of proteins and other chemicals is essential to understanding how the brain works—and how it goes awry. In Parkinson’s disease the substantia nigra neurons produce less dopamine than normal, for reasons that aren’t yet clear. Alzheimer’s disease scatters tangles of protein through the brain, although scientists have yet to firmly settle on how those tangles give rise to the devastating dementia the disease causes.A map of the brain’s molecular machinery called the Allen Brain Atlas has been generated at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, founded ten years ago with funds from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Using the brains of recently deceased people, donated by their families, researchers there use a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of each brain as a three-dimensional road map, then slice it into microscopically thin sections that are mounted on glass slides. They then douse the sections with chemicals that reveal the presence of active genes harbored in the neurons.So far the researchers have mapped the brains of six people, charting the activity of 20,000 protein-coding genes at 700 sites within each brain. It’s a colossal amount of data, and they’ve only begun to make sense of it. The scientists estimate that 84 percent of all the genes in our DNA become active somewhere in the adult brain. (A simpler organ like the heart or pancreas requires far fewer genes to work.) In each of the 700 sites the scientists studied, the neurons switch on a distinct collection of genes. In a preliminary survey of two regions of the brain, the scientists compared a thousand genes that were already known to be important for neuron function. From one person to the next, the areas of the brain where each of those genes was active were practically identical. It looks as if the brain has a finely grained genetic landscape, with special combinations of genes carrying out tasks in different locations. The secret to many diseases of the brain may be hiding in that landscape, as certain genes shut down or switch on abnormally.All the information from the Allen Brain Atlas is posted online, where other scientists can navigate through the data with custom-made software. Already they’re making new discoveries. A team of Brazilian scientists, for instance, has used it to study a devastating brain disorder called Fahr’s disease, which calcifies regions deep inside the brain, leading to dementia. Some cases of Fahr’s disease had already been linked to a mutation in the gene SLC20A2. In the atlas the scientists found thatSLC20A2 is most active in precisely the regions that are targeted by the disease. They also found a network of other genes that is most active in the same areas, and now they’re trying to find out whether they’re involved in Fahr’s disease as well.Of all the new ways of visualizing the brain, perhaps the most remarkable is one invented by Stanford neuroscientist and psychiatrist Karl Deisseroth and his colleagues. To see the brain, they begin by making it disappear.On my visit to Deisseroth’s lab, undergraduate Jenelle Wallace led me to a bench where half a dozen beakers rested in a plastic-foam base. She pulled one out and pointed to a grape-size mouse brain resting at the bottom. I didn’t look at the brain so much as through it. It was nearly as transparent as a glass marble.Needless to say, a normal human or mouse brain is decidedly opaque, its cells swathed in fat and other compounds that block light. That’s why Cajal had to dye neurons in order to see them and why Lichtman’s group and the Allen Institute scientists slice the brain into thin sections to gain access to its inner depths. The advantage of a transparent brain is that it allows us to peer into its workings while the organ is still intact. Along with postdoctoral researcher Kwanghun Chung, Deisseroth came up with a recipe to replace the light-scattering compounds in the brain with transparent molecules. After making a mouse brain transparent in this way, they can then douse the brain with glowing chemical labels that latch on to only certain proteins or trace a specific pathway connecting neurons in distant regions of the brain. The scientists can then wash out one set of chemicals and add another that reveals the location and structure of a different type of neuron—in effect untangling the Gordian knot of neural circuits one by one.“You don’t have to take it apart to show the wiring,” says Deisseroth.It’s not easy to dazzle neuroscientists, but Deisseroth’s method, dubbed CLARITY, has left his colleagues awestruck. “It’s pretty badass,” says Christof Koch, the chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute. Wedeen has called the research “spectacular ... unlike anything else in the field.”Because of our shared evolutionary heritage, a clarified mouse brain can reveal a great deal about human brain function. But Deisseroth’s ultimate goal is to perform the same transformation with a human brain—a far more difficult task, not least because a human brain is 3,000 times as large as that of a mouse.A CLARITY picture showing the location of just one type of protein in just one human brain would create a monstrous heap of data—about two petabytes, or the equivalent of several hundred thousand high-def movies. Deisseroth anticipates that CLARITY may someday help the sort of people he treats in his psychiatric practice, by revealing hidden features of disorders like autism and depression. But for now he’s keeping those hopes in check.“We have so far to go before we can affect treatments that I tell people, Don’t even think about that yet,” he says. “It’s just a voyage of discovery for now.”As revealing as a transparent brain may prove to be, it will still be dead. Scientists need different tools to explore the terrain of living brains. The scanners Wedeen uses to trace white matter patterns can, with different programming, record the brain in action. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pinpoints regions of the brain recruited during a mental task. Over the past couple of decades fMRI has helped reveal networks involved in all manner of thought processes, from recognizing faces to enjoying a cup of coffee to remembering a traumatic event.It’s easy to be dazzled by fMRI images, which festoon the brain with rainbow blobs. But it’s important to bear in mind that those images are actually quite coarse. The most powerful scanners can record activity only down to the scale of a cubic millimeter—a sesame seed’s worth of tissue. Within that space, hundreds of thousands of neurons are firing in synchronized patterns, trading signals. How those signals give rise to the larger patterns revealed by fMRI remains mysterious.“There are ridiculously simple questions about the cortex that we can’t answer at all,” says Clay Reid, a former colleague of Jeff Lichtman’s at Harvard who moved to the Allen Institute in 2012.Reid has come to Seattle hoping to answer some of those questions with a grand series of experiments he and his colleagues call MindScope. Their goal is to understand how a large number of neurons carry out a complex task.The function Reid and his colleagues have chosen to decipher is vision. Scientists have been investigating how we see for decades, but they’ve been able to study it only piecemeal. A neuroscientist might place an electrode in the region of a mouse’s brain involved in visual perception and then note whether nearby neurons fire when the animal sees a particular image.This approach has allowed scientists to map regions of the visual brain that specialize in different tasks, such as detecting the edges of an object or perceiving brightness. But scientists haven’t been able to see all those regions work together at once—to learn how the million or so neurons in the visual regions of a mouse’s brain instantly put information together into the image of a cat.Reid and his colleagues are setting out to solve that problem by engineering mice so that their visual neurons will release flashes of light when they fire. The flashes record the neural activity when a mouse sees a specific object, be it a cat, a snake, or an appealing piece of cheese. The scientists can then compile the data to create massive mathematical models of vision. If the models are accurate, the researchers will be able to literally read the mind of a mouse.“Our goal is to reconstruct what the mouse sees,” says Reid. “And I think we can do it.”Reid’s research on mouse vision is another step toward neuroscience’s ultimate goal: a comprehensive view of how this vastly complicated organ really works—what the scientists I talked to call a theory of the brain. Such a grand vision is still a long way off, and for the most part, the search for it has yet to change the way doctors treat patients. But there is one line of research—brain-machine interfaces—where the mapping of the mind has started to change people’s lives.When she was 43 years old, Cathy Hutchinson suffered a massive stroke, leaving her unable to move or speak. Lying in her bed in Massachusetts General Hospital, she gradually figured out that her doctors didn’t know if she was brain-dead or still aware. Her sister asked Hutchinson if she could understand her. She managed to answer by moving her eyes up on command.“It gave me such a relief,” Hutchinson tells me 17 years later, “because everybody talked about me as if I was dying.”It is a chilly winter day at her home in eastern Massachusetts, and she’s sitting in a wheelchair in the middle of the living room, dressed in a dark green jogging suit and sneakers. Still almost completely paralyzed and unable to speak, she communicates by looking at letters arrayed on a computer monitor bolted to her wheelchair, a camera tracking the movement of a tiny metal disk attached to the center of her eyeglasses.Near the top of the brain is a region called the motor cortex, where we generate commands to move our muscles. For more than a century we’ve known that each part of the cortex corresponds to a particular area of the body. When people like Hutchinson become paralyzed, the motor cortex often remains intact, but it can’t communicate with the rest of the body, because its connections have been destroyed. John Donoghue, a neuroscientist at Brown University, wanted to find a way to help people with paralysis by tapping into the signals from their motor cortex. Perhaps they could eventually learn to type on a computer or operate a machine merely with their thoughts. Donoghue spent years developing an implant and testing the device on monkeys. Once he and his colleagues knew it was safe, they were ready to start working with human patients.One of them was Hutchinson. In 2005 surgeons at Rhode Island Hospital drilled a hole the size of a poker chip in her skull and inserted the sensor for Donoghue’s device. About the size of a ladybug, the sensor contained a hundred miniature needles, which, pressing into Hutchinson’s motor cortex, recorded the signals from nearby neurons. A set of wires anchored to this device passed through the hole in her skull and led to a metal connector sitting on her scalp.After her surgery had healed, the Brown University researchers plugged Hutchinson’s implant into a cable that relayed signal patterns from her brain to a cart of computers they wheeled into her room. As a first step, the scientists trained the computers to recognize signals in her motor cortex and use them to move a computer cursor around a screen. This was achieved the first time she tried because they had learned how to translate patterns of brain activity into movements. Two years later they coupled a robotic arm to the computers, refining a program that could interpret Hutchinson’s brain signals to move the arm forward and back, to raise it up and down, and to open its robotic fingers and squeeze them shut.After just a few sessions Hutchinson, the computer, and the robotic arm had become a team. “It felt natural,” she tells me. So natural that one day she reached out for a cinnamon latte, grabbed it, and brought it to her lips to drink.“Cathy’s smile when she put down that drink—that’s everything,” Donoghue says.Today Donoghue and other scientists are building on that success, hoping to create human-machine interfaces that will be powerful, safe, and easy. At Duke University Miguel Nicolelis has been experimenting with exoskeletons that strap on to the body. Signals from the brain control each limb. Already he has gotten monkeys to control full-body exoskeletons. If all goes well, a paraplegic wearing a simpler version of the device will deliver the opening kick at the 2014 World Cup in Nicolelis’s native Brazil.“Eventually brain implants will become as common as heart implants,” says Nicolelis. “I have no doubt about that.”When it comes to the brain, predicting the future is a tricky game. Advances in the past have inspired giddy expectations that in many cases have not been met. “We can’t tell a schizophrenic brain from an autistic brain from a normal brain,” says Christof Koch. But the research that’s going on now, he believes, is moving neuroscience to a remarkable new stage. “I think we can begin to put the pieces together.”",
"Teenager Abby Jones had an idea for something meaningful to do during the pandemic: “She started filling jars with dried rosebuds and glitter—little fairy jars for kids in the neighborhood to find,” says mom Brooke Jones, vice president of the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation.Abby placed them in public pathways and parks. The local kids were so thrilled that she followed up with handmade, giant bubble wands. Says Jones, “She was looking for something to cheer others up—it ended up cheering her up!”Acts of kindness can be rewarding, but it turns out doing things for others is more than just uplifting. It can promote good health, making it an extra-big gift for kids during a pandemic. "We know that being kind goes a heck of a long way to make us feel better,” says Stanley Spinner, vice president and chief medical officer of Texas Children’s Pediatrics and Texas Children’s Urgent Care.That’s great news for parents who want to raise considerate kids who can weather these often unkind times.According to the Mayo Clinic, practicing kindness has both physical and mental health benefits. It can boost self-esteem while decreasing the stress hormone cortisol. Being kind also releases endorphins, which are the body’s natural painkillers.Practicing kindness as a child may also pay off later in life. In a 20-year study, psychologists tracked kids from kindergarten until they turned 25, and revealed the surprising benefits of “pro-social behavior”—that is, being cooperative, helpful, empathetic, and just plain nice. The results: Kids who showed these behaviors early on were more likely to stay in school, avoid criminal activity, steer clear of drug or alcohol abuse, and have better mental health as grown-ups.Nowadays, as kids deal with the ongoing stressors of the pandemic, it’s especially important for children to practice kindness as a way to stay connected with others.“We do not function well in isolation, and it’s probably more difficult for kids because they don’t have all the social and emotional skills to get through really stressful times like this," Jones says. “The science tells us that kindness doesn’t live in a bubble. It functions when we’re connected to each other.”Richard Weissbourd, faculty director of Making Caring Common at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, agrees: "Kindness is what gets our families healthy, our country healthy. It's how we live together so we’re constructive and joyful. If we don’t take care of each other, we won’t survive.”Most parents want their kids to value being kind. Yet according to a national survey from Making Caring Common, children tend to believe that their parents care more about them getting good grades and doing what makes them happy—not necessarily about them making others happy.Experts say that parents can turn that sentiment around by paying attention to their own behavior. Parents can model kindness toward others in their community, but children might pick up more kindness cues at home. Physican David Fryburg, co-founder of Envision Kindness, says that simple acts like smiles, hugs, and being considerate (you know, that time you did the dishes even though it wasn’t your turn) can help signal to kids that kindness is important.“We know that children who are generous and kind are in part that way because of the modeling of the parents,” says Mark T. Greenberg, a professor of human development and psychology at Pennsylvania State University who co-authored the 20-year study tracking kindergartners.One way kids can build kindness is to look for little ways to be kind each day. “Kindness is like a muscle,” says Weissbourd, author of The Parents We Mean to Be. “It needs practice.” Here are some surprising ways to build that strength.Give something away. Leaving surprise gifts for neighbors or even strangers is a great way to teach kids selflessness—after all, they might not see the results of their actions. Jones suggests painting rocks, writing kind messages on them, and leaving them in a neighbor’s yard or even in a parking lot to be discovered.Write a note to health-care professionals. Though a card would be meaningful to anyone, it may have extra impact for first responders. “Hearing from children as a first responder is incredibly meaningful because kids are very sincere,” Spinner says. And if children write to their own doctors, the deed might have a ripple effect: Connecting with patients builds physicians’ empathy, and studies show that when doctors are more empathetic, their patients report feeling better faster.“Appreciate you.” Whether your child reaches out to a teacher on the front lines of the pandemic or a child’s friend who might be going through a hard time, telling someone how much they mean to you is a kindness that won’t be forgotten. One idea is to stuff a jar full of notes for a teacher—everything from fun facts they learned in school to one-word answers like “You!” (Check out these other gratitude-building ideas.)Smile more. Sharing a smile is an easy and powerful kind act—even from behind a mask. (Just add a nod or wave.) “Emotions are contagious," Fryburg says. “If I smile at you, the likelihood that you're going to smile back rises. And if I’m happy, the likelihood that you'll be happy rises, too.” In fact, a Harvard research study showed that people with happy next-door neighbors were 34 percent more likely to be happy themselves.Look at kind things. According to Jones, people who witness an act of kindness experience the same beneficial internal reactions as people who do the act of kindness—or receive it. “We call this ‘triangulation of kindness,’” she adds. And those feelings, in turn, inspire the witness to want to do good themselves. (Consider it positive peer pressure.)“Seeing kindness each day will help re-center everyone, especially with all the difficult and negative images in the world people are exposed to,” says Fryburg, who co-founded Envision Kindness to spread stories and pictures of people doing really nice things.Get funny. How do you get a squirrel to like you? Act like a nut! Kind kids want others to feel good, so telling a joke—especially during tough times—is an easy act of kindness. Plus it relieves stress, boosts endorphins, and might help people live longer. Help kids find their funny bone with this interactive game.",
"The holidays are getting back to normal—sort of.  Families are still facing challenges from another winter of illness from COVID-19, the flu, and other viruses like RSV. And lingering supply chain disruptions as well as increased prices from inflation, could once again make for a stressful shopping season.It’s enough to make anyone—especially children—feel hopeless. But experts say teaching kids to have a gratitude mindset can help them weather this challenge and any still to come.“Gratitude is like a secret ingredient to happiness, or a superpower to foster positive feelings,” says pediatrician Hina Talib, who specializes in adolescent medicine at Children’s Hospital in Montefiore, New York. “There has never been a more important time for youth to practice flexing their gratitude muscles.”The rewards go far beyond that momentary feel-good emotion. Experts say grateful people tend to be more resilient, empathetic, and compassionate.“Expressing gratitude releases oxytocin in the brain, which promotes a feeling of empathy, calmness, trust, and a sense of safety,” says author and parent coach Elaine Uskoski. Plus, “having the ability to look for a positive perspective during trying times gives a child an opportunity to control their emotional response. A child will then be less likely to experience fear, anxiety, and a sense of powerlessness.”According to Andrea Hussong, a clinical psychologist and professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, these social and cognitive benefits of gratitude may be why youth who experience more moments of gratitude report less depression, more satisfying relationships, and greater life satisfaction.Ready to build an attitude of gratitude in your child? Here’s how experts suggest you do it.Your mom had the right idea when she forced you to write thank-you notes to Aunt Audrey for the sweater you hated. But the bigger idea is to get kids to express gratitude from a place of genuine appreciation.In a recent study she conducted, Hussong found that gratitude was genuine when it accomplished four key goals:• If expressing gratitude helped children notice desirable gifts, including things they already have, experiences, and relationships• If it helped them think about why they received these gifts, what it took for someone to give it to them, or what led to them receiving the gift• If it connected their positive feelings about gifts with the people and experiences behind those gifts• If it encouraged genuine acts of appreciation toward giversWorking through all four goals will help your child express heartfelt and honest gratitude and gain those physical and emotional benefits. So for instance, your child could notice that the sweater from Aunt Audrey has butterflies, which she knows your kid likes; think about the fact that Aunt Audrey took the time to pick a personal gift; note how great it is to feel special enough to get that kind of attention; then take the time to call or write to thank her for the gift. All that works toward creating genuine gratitude, Hussong explains.That doesn’t mean your child has to be happy about the sweater. Uskoski suggests giving kids a moment to express their disappointment before moving on to the gratitude training. “It’s OK to feel sad or angry at the loss, and it’s important for a parent to allow a child to express these emotions and acknowledge them,” she says. “Only then can the discussion of gratitude begin.”Parents who have trained themselves to express their own gratitude will likely see kids do the same. It can be as simple as sharing what they’re looking forward to each morning or vocalizing why they’re leaving a card for the mail carrier.Moms and dads can also reinforce gratitude by positively pivoting when something doesn’t quite go as planned. Raining on the day of your family picnic? Try an indoor food fest instead. Last-minute teacher swap with someone your child doesn’t know yet? Recast it as an opportunity to connect with someone new. (Maybe this one likes Star Wars, too!) Uskoski says that when things go wrong—and they always will—a grateful child will be able to see what’s still right.“Within these conversations, it’s important to discuss that children may not like certain weather conditions, or they won’t always get the teacher they hoped for,” she says. “But they can learn to adapt and be still be grateful for things like nature’s gifts, food on the table, and education.”If you see your kid doing something nice for a pal, call it out. But keep the conversation going. “Conversations are also a powerful tool,” Hussong says. “Parents can ask what children noticed, felt, thought, and did in moments when the child moved beyond a polite ‘thank-you’ to deeper appreciation.”When an opportunity is missed, talk about that, too. That can help parents understand any barriers to gratitude that a child needs to overcome. “Parents may offer children other ways of seeing these moments and helping them learn skills in these challenging situations,” Hussong adds.Expressing gratitude through a pay-it-forward approach can help a child grow into a better community member, one who cares about others and wants them to have the same experiences the kid is grateful for. That’s something Hussong calls “virtuous gratitude.”“It requires us to express deep appreciation in ways that go beyond saying ‘thank you’ to someone who gifts us something,” she says. Kids might contribute to the food bank because they’re grateful to have access to healthy food, even if they’ve never needed food bank services; or they might pick up trash at the local park because they’re grateful that spaces like that exists in their community—a feeling inspired by a hike they took while on vacation.“Whether the issue is social injustice, climate change, or the pandemic, how we connect with others, understand others, and support others is how we cultivate communities that protect and nurture ourselves,” Hussong says. “Those connections are at the heart of why gratitude matters.”Journaling and meditation are both great options for helping kids identify and express what they’re grateful for, Talib says. For older children, she recommends a “three good things” approach.“Every night, write down three things that went well, made you smile, or you were grateful for that day,” Talib says. “Note a few details and how it made you feel.”Keep it simple, but make sure your child is writing it down—not just thinking about it, she says. The practice can show results within a week: Talib says that studies show that you can get two percent happier in a week, five percent in a month, and nine percent in six months from this process. (Get tips to help kids start journaling.)Younger kids can try filling a gratitude jar with tokens or little notes as a visual reminder of practicing gratitude. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that the routine is something that your child is on board with. If they like doing it, they’ll be more likely to stick with it.Then keep talking about what they’re doing. “Listen carefully to show them you care—about gratitude and them,” Hussong says. “Because in the end, gratitude is meant to connect us, and when parents connect with their child, gratitude is sure to follow.”",
"Children’s hospitals across the United States are raising the alarm that their beds have filled up with young patients struggling to breathe. This year, the culprit is not coronavirus but respiratory syncytial virus—more commonly known as RSV.RSV is not a new pathogen. The virus infects some 64 million people a year worldwide. But it poses a particularly high risk to adults over 65 and to children, who are more likely to require hospitalization. Globally, RSV causes about 160,000 deaths a year—including more than 100,000 children under the age of five. Still, there isn’t a vaccine for the disease or any treatments available for general use.But solutions are on the way. Experts say that a monoclonal antibody treatment for RSV could be approved by the end of the year, and a vaccine could be rolled out in time for the 2023 RSV season. Pfizer said on November 1 that its vaccine is 81 percent effective in an infant's first 90 days of life and 69 percent effective through the first six months of life. The company plans to file for approval of its RSV vaccine candidate by the end of 2022. (Why vaccines are critical to keeping diseases at bay.)“This could be a huge game changer globally,” says Keith Klugman, director of the pneumonia program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is funding Pfizer’s maternal vaccine candidate.Here’s what you need to know about RSV, why cases are so high right now in the U.S., and why experts say these new developments are so promising.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RSV is a respiratory virus that primarily spreads through coughing, sneezing, and other forms of close contact. It’s also seasonal: In the U.S., RSV is at its worst in the winter months. Anyone can catch or spread RSV, but people with healthy immune systems tend to suffer only mild cold-like symptoms.Older adults with weakened immune systems have a harder time staving off the virus—as do young children, whose still-developing immune systems have never been exposed to the pathogen. They are more likely to have severe RSV infections, which can include symptoms such as dehydration and difficulty breathing.“RSV was unequivocally the most important cause of serious respiratory disease in infants and young children” before COVID-19 came along, says Kathleen Neuzil, director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. Young children are also especially vulnerable because their airways are narrow: Among children younger than one, RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, the inflammation of airways in the lung.It’s not unusual for the U.S. to see this many cases in an RSV season, but it is a bit unusual to see RSV surging so early in the year. Neuzil suspects that COVID-19 is to blame: “COVID-19 has really wreaked havoc on the seasonality of our respiratory viruses,” she says. Now that many people are no longer regularly wearing masks, experts hypothesize that the viruses have begun circulating out of season simply because people are more vulnerable to infection after two years of not getting sick.Neuzil says that it’s unclear whether this change is permanent or whether RSV will ultimately revert to its normal seasonal pattern, which begins as early as mid-September but peaks from late December to mid-February. It also remains to be seen whether the current surge represents the peak of this year’s RSV season—or whether the worst is yet to come.Researchers have spent decades attempting to prevent RSV deaths. But an effort to develop a vaccine in the 1960s was a colossal failure—sickening children rather than protecting them.Bill Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development at Pfizer, says it was clear then that the goal was to “attack the business end of the virus,” or the protein that allows the virus to fuse with the membrane of a human lung cell.But the fundamental breakthrough came in 2013, Gruber says, when scientists discovered they needed to stabilize the viral protein used in the vaccine to keep it in its pre-fusion form. That’s the idea behind most of the treatments currently under development. (How COVID-19 is changing our expectations for other vaccines.)The RSV treatment that’s furthest along in the pipeline is Nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody developed by AstraZeneca. Given to infants by injection at birth or soon after, Nirsevimab directly delivers RSV antibodies directly to their bloodstreams, allowing their immune systems to neutralize the virus and keep it from replicating.In March, a study of the phase 3 clinical trial showed a 75 percent efficacy in protecting infants from lower respiratory tract infections severe enough to require medical care. In early October, the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed clinical trial data and reported that regulatory authorization is “imminent.”Neuzil—a member of SAGE and its RSV vaccine technical advisory group—says it’s possible the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could authorize the treatment by the end of 2022.There’s a robust pipeline of RSV vaccine candidates in development, Neuzil says. But the first that’s likely to cross the finish line is Pfizer’s maternal vaccine, which is designed for pregnant people. The idea behind this vaccine is to protect babies before they’re even born by vaccinating the mother who makes antibodies which then pass to the fetus through the blood.In April, a study of phase 2b clinical trials showed that Pfizer’s vaccine produced a high level of antibodies, earning it a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, meaning that the agency plans to expedite the development and review of the vaccine. On November 1, Pfizer said that the positive results of its phase three trials mean that the company can now wrap up the trials and file for regulatory approval. Klugman of the Gates Foundation says that FDA approval could come in 2023.“This is something I’ve been looking forward to my whole professional life,” Gruber says. “We are making the right sort of antibody, so I think we are in a very good position to be successful.”Meanwhile top-line results from Pfizer’s phase three trials among older adults showed an 85 percent efficacy. And a slew of other RSV vaccine candidates are not far behind. Some of these candidates contain adjuvants, or substances that increase the immune response, which Neuzil says are not ideal for use during pregnancy.“It’s so exciting what we’re seeing with the new RSV vaccines and the antibodies, but it’s not going to help the babies this winter,” Neuzil says. She recommends that people continue to take precautions like masking, particularly if they spend time around newborns or older people who are especially vulnerable to severe RSV.“We’re getting close, but we won’t be there this year,” she says. “So it’s really, really important to be very careful.”",
"As scientists raced to create new vaccines that would fight the novel coronavirus, Matthew Motta had a question: What did Americans expect from these vaccines?Motta, a political scientist at Oklahoma State University who studies vaccine hesitancy, polled nearly 1,000 American adults on their expectations for the then-hypothetical shots. His peer-reviewed study, published this March in Social Science & Medicine, uncovered what he described as predictable results: Given the choice between various efficacy rates and single or multi-dose shots, the vaccine Americans would most prefer was a single dose that boasted at least 90 percent efficacy and almost zero chance of causing even minor side effects.“It’s not too surprising that people would prefer safe and effective vaccines,” he says. But as Motta reviewed the poll’s results last year, he says he was worried because “these vaccines were never particularly likely to live up to the hype.”And then they did.The first two vaccines approved for emergency use authorization in the United States — shots created by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech using new-to-market mRNA technology — boasted 94 and 95 percent efficacy rates, respectively, shattering the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s benchmark of 50 percent and causing the scientific community and the public alike to celebrate.It was, Motta says, “amazing news.” But it also led him to another worrisome question: Would these spectacularly efficacious and safe shots — produced in record-breaking time — fundamentally change people’s vaccine expectations? In other words, would people come to expect that future vaccines be created as quickly and be as safe and potent as the COVID-19 vaccines?Motta is seeking funding to find the answer. But he and other experts suspect that — at least in the short term — some people’s vaccine expectations have risen, with potentially serious consequences: Expecting quickly created, near-perfect vaccines could increase hesitancy in those already inclined to waver in their vaccine convictions if future vaccines fall short.Historically, “a vaccine for a disease was either available or not,” explains Rossi Hassad, an epidemiologist and professor of psychology at Mercy College. “Evaluating the efficacy and safety of vaccines has not been part of the public’s pre-COVID-19 psyche and vocabulary.”For example, the yellow fever vaccine — a one-shot vaccine recommended for those traveling to at-risk areas in Africa and South America — carries a miniscule risk of severe reactions and even death. But “most people don’t know that,” says Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a government adviser on vaccine policy. “I think most people don’t know the risks because we didn’t trumpet them like we trumpeted this.”Amid the pandemic, however, almost all publications focused on covering the virus and potential ways to fight it, including the development of vaccines. The public could choose from dozens of articles each day relaying details of the vaccines’ development, including the potential risks they posed for those who would later decide to get inoculated.In late 2020, Jennifer Trueblood, an associate professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University asked roughly 34,000 Americans about their willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. The subsequent study, published in March in Social Psychological and Personality Science, revealed that people who are risk averse were less likely to say that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.“What’s clear is that people are viewing [COVID-19] vaccines as a risky decision,” she says. And the public’s collective and all-consuming attention to “very specific information about the risks and rewards is shaping how people are thinking about vaccines more generally,” she adds.To make decisions, many people need a reference point — information that helps them weigh the pros and cons of a particular choice. For example, if a college graduate is offered a starting salary of $50,000, she may not know whether that is a good deal. But if she learns the majority of her classmates have been offered only $30,000, then she is likely to believe that she is earning very good money.In this way, the first COVID-19 vaccines to be authorized for emergency use in the U.S. may have set a reference point for people to evaluate future shots, says Gretchen Chapman, a psychologist and professor of social and decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.Hassad adds: “The standard set by the mRNA vaccines — in terms of speed of development and the level of efficacy and effectiveness — will quite likely raise the bar in terms of public expectations: wanting more, better, and faster when it comes to … vaccines for other diseases.”If a doctor recommends a particular vaccine, he explains, “I can hear people saying, ‘How good is that vaccine? How effective is it? Is it good for people like me? Are there any factors about my life that I need to consider?’ I think it’s just really upped the bar in terms of patient education in their personal health — which, of course, will contribute to their decision-making about health.”The COVID-19 vaccines were also produced in less than a year. Decades of research and billions of dollars of government funding, combined with a single-minded focus from the scientific community, facilitated their swift production. But at the end of the day, what sticks for some is the headline: that a vaccine can be created and go to market in less than a year.Offit rejects the notion that people’s vaccine expectations are shifting fundamentally, in part because he believes that people have always expected the very safest and efficacious vaccines.But he says the quick creation of COVID-19 vaccines “should have awakened people to the fact that when you put an enormous amount of money into something, we have the scientific ability and know-how to do something as remarkable as this.”Motta’s study, conducted ahead of the release of the vaccines’ final clinical trial results, showed that participants only had a slight preference for shots that take longer to develop: they were almost equally likely to take a vaccine that took a little more than a year to create and one that took a little less than a year to produce. “At the time, that was good news, because it meant that people were willing to take a shot that, relatively speaking, was developed quickly,” Motta says.But he also wonders if the speed at which they were created could cause a future problem: “If a vaccine takes longer to develop, will people be less likely to take it?” Motta asks.The answer, he says, is unknowable now. However, a national survey conducted in March by the Pew Research Center revealed that “a sense that vaccines were developed and tested too quickly” was a top concern for 67 percent of the respondents who say that they do not plan to get a COVID-19 shot. A separate April poll found that about one in five Americans say they will not get a vaccine.The COVID-19 vaccines may have also set another reference point: that the public should have its choice among vaccines targeting a specific disease. Though many people have struggled to get their first shots, others have had the luxury of choosing which COVID-19 vaccine to get.And for some, that choice was between what they perceived to be a better and worse vaccine.The third vaccine to be authorized for emergency use in the U.S. was Johnson & Johnson’s shot, which scientists hailed as a success: Unlike its predecessors, the vaccine didn’t require ultra-cold storage, which meant it could potentially better reach rural communities. And its one-dose regimen could make it easier for vulnerable communities — such as those without transportation or paid time off work — to get inoculated. But when publications shared the vaccine’s efficacy rate for preventing COVID-19 infection, 66 percent, some people perceived it to be subpar. (The Johnson & Johnson vaccine trials included some of the more easily transmissible variants of COVID-19, which could have lowered its efficacy rates, but most experts agree it is an excellent vaccine.)“There’s such a sensitivity about the vaccines and what they represent in terms of effectiveness and safety, especially since Johnson & Johnson entered the scene,” Hassad says.And a nationwide poll conducted in mid-April by ABC News and the Washington Post found that people’s confidence in the shot plummeted when the FDA temporarily paused its distribution after six women contracted life-threatening blood clots: a majority of unvaccinated Americans — about 73 percent — said that they were unwilling to get the J & J vaccine. The FDA later lifted its pause, and recommended its continued distribution.While the evidence is currently based on polls and anecdotal accounts, “it looks like we might be developing perceptions of a hierarchy of good versus not-as-good vaccines,” says Kasisomayajula Viswanath, a professor of health communication in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, “and that worries me.”In the short term, unreasonable expectations of vaccines can have devastating consequences: By pausing the distribution of the J & J vaccine, Offit says the FDA put a “scarlet letter” on the shot — and with that red flag in place, “there are people who would have gotten that vaccine who now won’t, and because they won’t get that vaccine, they don’t get a vaccine.”In the long term, having a choice between COVID-19 vaccines could also potentially create an “analogous phenomenon” that applies to other vaccines, whether COVID-19 boosters or other vaccines entirely, says Chapman. “If people know that a choice is possible — and especially for some savvy consumer patients who are going to read up on all the comparison points between the vaccines — it’s possible that now they’re going to come in and demand a particular vaccine.”But overall, in the pandemic or out, “if people delay for long periods, unvaccinated, to wait to get access to what they perceive as a better vaccine, they put themselves and their communities at risk,” says Walter Orenstein, a physician and associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center.Trueblood says that people’s overall expectations of vaccines are “likely to be determined by their experiences with recent vaccines,” and that the COVID-19 shots could serve as a reference point for coronavirus boosters and even novel vaccines produced in the next couple of years.However, it’s “really hard to tell” if those expectations will persist, she says. “It’s my hunch that they would have less of an influence as time goes on,” Trueblood adds.Events that are similar to one another can cause people to recall specific memories: If another pandemic-causing disease emerged in a decade, “that’s going to cause people to remember this experience more,” Trueblood says. But if a novel vaccine is created to fight a different disease, under different circumstances, “it’s hard for me to believe that people’s experiences with the COVID-19 vaccines will have much of an influence,” she says.Some experts believe looking to the upcoming influenza season could provide clues to whether vaccine expectations now will have a lingering effect later. “What I’m seeing is a year from now — when COVID-19 becomes very manageable — at that point, we will get back to the issue of flu vaccines,” Viswanath says. “And I'm wondering if people will start paying attention to them.”Fewer than half of American adults get flu shots each year, which range in effectiveness from 40 to 60 percent. “I’m wondering now, if even more adults will say that, compared to COVID-19, the flu is really not that severe and the efficacy rates are so much lower — so why should I bother kind of a thing?” Viswanath says. Other adult vaccines are much more effective: The shingles vaccine, for example, is 90 percent effective at preventing the infection and pain.In the meantime, the right kind of health communication is essential to helping people set reasonable expectations of vaccines — and encourage vaccinations in spite of perceived risk.When people are oversaturated with vaccine information, targeted messages that appeal to their perceptions and beliefs are crucial, says Hassad. Motta agrees. “You can sometimes move the needle on vaccine hesitancy, pun intended, with information,” he says. “But a far more effective way to convince people to vaccinate is to make an effort to understand why they don’t want to vaccinate and then present them with information in a way that [assuages] those concerns.”",
"As the first four million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine shipped in March throughout the United States, experts lauded qualities that make it more practical: Unlike its mRNA predecessors, this vaccine doesn’t require ultra-cold storage and needs only a single dose to protect people against serious COVID-19 outcomes—including, most importantly, death.These attributes mean it could be more easily deployed to reach communities that have been left behind as an inequitable vaccine rollout has overly favored white people. But there’s a catch. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has an overall efficacy lower than the other two vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use in the country. And that fact has raised concerns that marginalized communities—including Black, Latino, and Indigenous people with the highest risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes and a history of medical mistreatment—would be steered toward the vaccine with the lowest level of protection against severe and mild disease.Infectious disease experts say it’s not that simple: There’s nuance to efficacy rates that must be considered when comparing the available vaccines, and positioning one as inferior could hinder efforts to stamp out a pandemic that has already cost more than 546,000 American lives.When people draw conclusions from incomplete information, “that’s where things can really go awry,” says Sandra Soo-Jin Lee, chief of the Division of Ethics at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, “particularly in this context, where time is not on our side.”It’s important to note, experts say, that all three vaccines offer significant protection against COVID-19. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may also offer some advantages to marginalized communities. Every expert interviewed for this article agreed on one thing: The best vaccine, they say, is the vaccine people can get today.But widely distributing a vaccine people are wary of accepting could also have negative impacts, experts acknowledge: It could amplify existing vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccination rates.“It shouldn’t be surprising that groups who have felt there have been some injustices—in both research and access to care—would feel distrustful of the government or other institutions, in terms of the vaccine delivery,” Lee says. “I understand why there might be some concerns.”Efficacy is often presented in a single number. For example, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it said the two-shot regimen was 95 percent efficacious in preventing COVID-19.But zeroing in on a single number misrepresents the data, says Kathleen Neuzil, a physician and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and can fuel incorrect assumptions about what a vaccine can and cannot do.“Anytime I see a single percentage in a headline, I get anxiety,” she says, “because it’s wrong.”The vaccines developed to protect against the novel coronavirus were measured in clinical trials against several endpoints, including their ability to protect against mild disease, severe disease, and death. When it comes to protecting against death, all three vaccines are 100 percent efficacious. In other words, not a single clinical trial participant died of COVID-19 after receiving full doses of the vaccines.Both the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines maintained their impressive efficacy of 100 percent in protecting against severe disease, but Johnson & Johnson’s dropped to 85 percent—and it dropped further when including mild COVID-19 disease, reaching 72 percent efficacy in U.S. trial participants.Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine was 95 percent efficacious against mild disease; Moderna’s vaccine reached 94 percent efficacy, but dropped to 86 percent for participants 65 and older.The AstraZeneca vaccine, which had an efficacy of 76 percent of preventing mild illness in U.S. trials, has not yet been authorized for emergency use in this country.But William Schaffner, a physician and professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, cautions against putting too much weight on the difference between efficacy rates because the vaccines “weren't trialed exactly cheek-to-cheek.”The trials of the currently authorized vaccines took place at different times, with Pfizer-BioNtech’s and Moderna’s ending before they could include the more easily transmissible COVID-19 variants that were first detected in the U.K. and Brazil. Johnson & Johnson’s trial included those variants. Experts don’t yet know how well the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines will fight the variants, though trials are underway.“When you’re considering the benefits of the vaccine, you’re not just looking at efficacy—you’re looking at the practical application of the vaccine, the delivery of the vaccines,” Chizoba Wonodi, an associate scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says. “Vaccines don’t save lives,” she explains. “Vaccinations save lives.”In an uneven vaccine rollout that has greatly benefited affluent and white people, many have been left behind. That includes people without transportation or childcare, those who work in essential jobs, and Black, brown, and Indigenous people. When it comes to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, some say its “delivery” makes it a logical choice to send to these harder-to-reach marginalized and vulnerable communities.“Right now, Black people, Latinx people, and Indigenous people are the people who are dying the most from COVID-19, but they have less access to the vaccine,” says Keisha Ray, an assistant professor and bioethicist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth.As of March 21, race and ethnicity were known for just 53 percent of people who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the data indicates marginalized groups are underrepresented in the distribution so far. For example, while Latino Americans represent more than 18 percent of the U.S. population, they’ve received just about 9 percent of the doses.When people come to her with concerns about the vaccines, Ray encourages them to take the vaccine that’s available to them. But while vaccine hesitancy is part of the problem, Ray says, it’s not the entire story. For these populations, “it’s not so much hesitancy as it is access,” she says, or lack thereof. Many Black and Latino Americans often lack necessities for vaccine access: transportation, Internet, paid time-off, and childcare. “All these things are difficult for people of color, who tend to work low-income jobs, who don’t have paid time-off,” Ray says.Unlike its predecessors, which require ultra-cold storage, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine needs to be stored only at refrigerator temperatures, making it accessible for hospitals and pharmacies that don’t have ultra-cold freezers and ideal for mobile vaccination efforts. If authorized for emergency use, the AstraZeneca vaccine would share this advantage: It too can be stored in a refrigerator for up to six months. So far, it’s been available outside the U.S., and has been critical to the World Health Organization’s campaign to vaccinate poor and middle-income countries.While Pfizer-BioNtech’s and Moderna’s vaccines require a two-dose regimen, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine requires only a single dose. This is a boon for people unable to take time off work, find childcare, or pay to park at a large medical facility, Ray says. And she adds that it also “lowers the risk of missing a second dose” for these groups.Nir Eyal, founder of the Center for Population-Level Bioethics at Rutgers University, says the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could be especially useful for transient populations, such as some homeless people, who might not be in the same place when it’s time for their second shot.All three COVID-19 vaccines share similar side effects: People may experience pain, redness, and swelling in their arms after injection, as well as fever, headache, chills, nausea, or tiredness. However, side effects can be more severe after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna’s vaccines—and on rare occasions, both have caused allergic reactions.Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine did not cause allergic reactions in its clinical trials. Even so, some people still have concerns about this vaccine.Ray, who is Black, understands why marginalized communities might be reluctant to embrace a vaccine that at first glance appears inferior but at the same time is being promoted by the medical community. “Black people, Latinx people, and Indigenous people have a horrible relationship with medicine and public health,” she says. “We’ve been experimented on. We’ve been tested on. We’ve been lied to. We’ve been misled.”Those same communities often face the most severe COVID-19 outcomes: Black and Hispanic Americans are about three times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 and about two times more likely to die from the disease than white Americans, according to data from the CDC. These same groups are overrepresented in jobs that put them on the frontlines of COVID-19 risk, including essential jobs such as grocery store employees and healthcare workers.If Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is widely available in these communities, “then that does look a little suspicious, as if people of color are sort of an afterthought,” Ray says.It’s unclear if current supplies will allow people or states to pick and choose which vaccines they accept and distribute. However, some policy makers may not accept shipments of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine; Detroit’s mayor recently spoke out against receiving the latest vaccines, saying the other vaccines are the “best” options for the city’s residents. (He later issued a statement saying that he had “full confidence” in Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.) Only four million doses have been shipped, and it’s unlikely more will be distributed until April.In the meantime, “we need to start creating spaces where we can promote dialogue and build trust,” says Claudia R. Sotomayor, bioethicist and assistant professor of internal medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. Without it, “it’s difficult to move forward.”Policy makers and healthcare providers can build trust with people who “perceive that they might be getting something inferior” by developing “really good public education as to what these various vaccines are able to do, both for them as individuals and their families and communities,” Lee says. “Transparency, and a real investment in public education about how important it is for folks to be vaccinated—regardless of which one they’re getting—is very, very important.”Ray says that she has concerns about how “perception of the vaccines among people of color and low-income communities” could affect the country’s journey to herd immunity. And Wonodi worries about what could happen to individuals if they shun a vaccine now for one they might get later.“People should not wait and say, I will come back in a week’s time,” Wonodi says. “You might get exposed to COVID-19 before you come back, and then you miss the chance to be protected.”She adds, “We have a lot more information about subtleties that really don't matter. Let’s not blow them out of proportion. The most sensible thing is to protect yourself as soon as you can.”Editor's Note: This article has been updated to correctly reflect the implications of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial efficacy rates.",
"After damning accusations from federal health officials, AstraZeneca released results from the primary analysis of the completed U.S. phase three trial showing that its vaccine was 76 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. That is 3 percentage points lower than the results announced Monday, which were based on incomplete trial data that only extended until February 17.The results were even better in adults 65 years and older; the vaccine had an efficacy of 85 percent. Most important, the vaccine was 100 percent effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and hospitalization and there were no reports of serious side effects, like those reported in Europe during the past month. AstraZeneca vaccinations were briefly halted in several European countries last week after a few people died from a rare blood clotting condition.Although the vaccine is not as effective as the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, it is safe and effective. The results are good news for AstraZeneca. In a highly unusual departure from what is usually a confidential process, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases revealed that AstraZeneca had been reprimanded for issuing an overly optimistic press release describing the results of its COVID-19 vaccine trials in the United States.NIAID released the statement early Tuesday morning after the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent group charged with keeping an eye on clinical trials, notified AstraZeneca about its concerns that the company chose to release data that presented the most favorable efficacy number for their vaccine. According the New York Times, the DSMB warned the company, “Decisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process.”The DSMB had met with AstraZeneca multiple times in the past two months, according to the Washington Post, and had seen vaccine efficacy numbers that ranged between 69 and 74 percent at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. The board advised the company to include those numbers in the press release. But the company only mentioned that the efficacy was 79 percent. AstraZeneca responded Tuesday, stating that those results were based on an “interim analysis” but that they were consistent with the primary results, which they released early Thursday morning. The company will submit the data for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S.The back and forth between AstraZeneca and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board may not have an immediate impact in the U.S., where three other vaccines have been authorized and are being used to vaccinate the population. But Eric Topol, a physician and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps in La Jolla, California, believes that AstraZeneca’s behavior could harm the vaccination campaign. "This really undermines the ability to roll out this vaccine,” says Topol. “It has a rippling effect across all the vaccines and gives fodder to those people who don't trust vaccines."The primary results are good news for regulators in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the World Health Organization who are trying  to restore faith in the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.Public health officials will be able to use the results to reassure the public that the vaccine is safe, and there is no indication that the shot can cause severe blood clots.“If there was a strong association, a clear signal would immediately become very obvious,” says Edward Jones-Lopez, an infectious disease specialist with Keck Medicine of USC, who is one of the investigators in the ongoing clinical trials of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the U.S. “But it is only when you have millions of people—which is an order of magnitude here greater than in the clinical trials—that very rare side effects become apparent.”But public health experts worry that it could be hard to restore shaken confidence in the vaccine’s safety at a crucial stage of the pandemic. New infections are rising again in many European countries driven by new variants; the continent recorded more than 1.2 million new cases last week. Further disruptions in vaccinations could cost more lives.“Once you scare people, it’s hard to unscare them, so we need a careful review of these cases,” says Paul Offit, a physician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who is also a professor of vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. “Sometimes, things occur in clusters and are meaningless. So we need to put this in context.”In the U.K., where more than 10 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine, there haven’t been any reports of these extremely rare clots. Overall, AstraZeneca has received 37 reports of blood clots out of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the EU and the U.K. as of March 8. In a statement, Ann Taylor, the company’s chief medical officer noted, “the number of cases of blood clots reported in this group is lower than the hundreds of cases that would be expected among the general population.”The safety data from the clinical trials of the vaccine, which encompassed tens of thousands of volunteers, didn’t pick up these adverse events either.Still, questions remain. The initial suspension in Germany was prompted by a report from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, the country’s agency in charge of vaccine safety, about a serious blood clotting disorder in seven patients that was fatal for three of them. Overall, a total of at least 13 patients in five nations, all of whom were between the ages of 20 and 50 and previously healthy, reported these symptoms; seven of them have died. All of these cases occurred between four and 16 days after vaccination with AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine.Some experts believe the incidence of this rare blood disorder is significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Called severe cerebral venous thrombosis, the syndrome has manifested in unusual ways. Patients have suffered from blood clots, often in the brain. At the same time, their blood platelet counts are low; platelets normally help with clotting and this depletion of clotting factors in the blood has led to internal bleeding. “It’s a very special picture” of symptoms, Steinar Madsen, medical director of the Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Science. “Our leading hematologist said he had never seen anything quite like it.”Scientists don’t know whether the vaccine caused this syndrome, or what the mechanism would be if the shot had triggered these side effects.“To see all these cases is worrisome,” says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. “We would call this a signal, not a conclusion, but a signal that needs to be investigated further. There’s smoke here and maybe even some fire. We have to distinguish between things that are causally related with things that are coincidental.”On Thursday, Norwegian scientists, who studied three Norwegian health workers affected by this very rare condition, stated they believed these reactions were, in fact, caused by the vaccine. Their explanation is that the vaccine caused the immune system to over-react, leading to the formation of antibodies that then caused the platelets in the blood to form clots. At the same time, these antibodies caused the opposite effect. By depleting blood platelets, which are essential for coagulating the blood, it also caused internal bleeding.“There is nothing in the patient history of these individuals that can give such a powerful immune response,” Pal Andre Holme, chief physician from the University Hospital of North Norway, told the Norwegian national newspaper VG on Thursday. “I am confident that the antibodies that we have found are the cause, and I see no other explanation than it.”Despite that, later that day, Emer Cooke, head of the European Medicines Agency, said, “This is a safe and effective vaccine.” Its benefits far outweigh the risks, noted Cooke, especially given the harm if people are deprived of access to a vaccine and get COVID-19. Even if the worst-case scenarios are eventually proven true, she added, and it turns out that in a small number of individuals this vaccine can trigger fatal blood clots and internal bleeding, for most people the vaccine would still be safe and effective. The agency will continue to investigate the links but given the EMA’s greenlight, EU nations plan to resume their vaccination campaigns.In the U.S., a similar but less serious blood disorder, called immune thrombocytopenia, has been seen in at least 36 people who have received either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the incidence of this condition isn’t any higher in vaccinated people than in those who are unvaccinated.“We’re vaccinating older people,” says Schaffner. “Even if we didn’t vaccinate, medical events occur in the older population every day.”Also, it isn’t unheard of for vaccines to trigger rare blood disorders. Offit notes that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine can cause thrombocytopenia in about one child per 30,000 doses.The AstraZeneca vaccine is different from both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in that it uses a modified cold virus to smuggle DNA fragments encoding parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus inside human cells to trigger an immune response. In contrast, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use what’s called mRNA technology to stimulate an immune response. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford collaborated to devise and test their version of the coronavirus vaccine. Clinical trials in the U.K., Brazil, and South Africa found the vaccine had an efficacy of 82.4 percent when two doses are given between four and 12 weeks apart.The surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is dotted with what are called spike proteins that it uses to latch onto, and then enter, human cells. This spike protein became a convenient target for vaccine makers. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, scientists spliced the gene that instructs the virus to build the spike protein into the DNA of a modified cold virus that affects chimpanzees. These cold viruses—carrying the spike protein gene—can infect human cells but don’t replicate or cause disease.When the AstraZeneca vaccine is injected into humans, these cold viruses latch onto to proteins on the surface of the cell, and like a tiny cargo ship, they deliver the DNA into it. The human cell’s machinery then uses the DNA instructions to manufacture the spike proteins that alert our immune system that a foreign intruder is present.When the immune system detects the spike protein it reacts as if the body were under attack from the real coronavirus. Immune cells that fight off infections and make antibodies swing into action. By latching onto the coronavirus spike proteins, the antibodies prevent infection by blocking the spike proteins attaching to cells. This prevents the virus from entering the cell.The AstraZeneca vaccine, which the British-Swedish company had produced in a collaboration with Oxford University scientists without the goal of making a profit, had been hailed as a life saver for developing countries and is key to the WHO’s campaign to inoculate poor and middle-income countries. It is inexpensive to produce, it can be churned out quickly in large quantities, and it can be kept in a conventional refrigerator for up to six months without having to stay frozen like the more fragile Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.The AstraZeneca vaccine has not yet been approved in the U.S. But it has been granted conditional marketing authorization or emergency use in more than 70 countries across six continents. Plus, the WHO’s recent emergency use listing should accelerate its access to up to 142 countries through COVAX, the WHO-led initiative that is designed to ensure even poor countries have access to the vaccines.“The worry is that there will be countries that will get upset about this,” says Vanderbilt’s Schaffner. “In the developing world, they’ll say, Gee, you’re giving us the second-rate vaccine.”Disruptions in the rollout could seriously undermine the global effort to curb the pandemic because the company committed to providing a large number of shots to underserved countries.“We’re only as strong as the weakest country out there,” says Offit of the University of Pennsylvania. “This was going to be an inexpensive, easily stored vaccine, and given to the world. I’m afraid people are not going to want to use it for the wrong reasons. If there is a safety issue, we need to find out because there is a lot riding on this.”",
"As the first four million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine shipped in March throughout the United States, experts lauded qualities that make it more practical: Unlike its mRNA predecessors, this vaccine doesn’t require ultra-cold storage and needs only a single dose to protect people against serious COVID-19 outcomes—including, most importantly, death.These attributes mean it could be more easily deployed to reach communities that have been left behind as an inequitable vaccine rollout has overly favored white people. But there’s a catch. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has an overall efficacy lower than the other two vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use in the country. And that fact has raised concerns that marginalized communities—including Black, Latino, and Indigenous people with the highest risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes and a history of medical mistreatment—would be steered toward the vaccine with the lowest level of protection against severe and mild disease.Infectious disease experts say it’s not that simple: There’s nuance to efficacy rates that must be considered when comparing the available vaccines, and positioning one as inferior could hinder efforts to stamp out a pandemic that has already cost more than 546,000 American lives.When people draw conclusions from incomplete information, “that’s where things can really go awry,” says Sandra Soo-Jin Lee, chief of the Division of Ethics at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, “particularly in this context, where time is not on our side.”It’s important to note, experts say, that all three vaccines offer significant protection against COVID-19. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine may also offer some advantages to marginalized communities. Every expert interviewed for this article agreed on one thing: The best vaccine, they say, is the vaccine people can get today.But widely distributing a vaccine people are wary of accepting could also have negative impacts, experts acknowledge: It could amplify existing vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccination rates.“It shouldn’t be surprising that groups who have felt there have been some injustices—in both research and access to care—would feel distrustful of the government or other institutions, in terms of the vaccine delivery,” Lee says. “I understand why there might be some concerns.”Efficacy is often presented in a single number. For example, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it said the two-shot regimen was 95 percent efficacious in preventing COVID-19.But zeroing in on a single number misrepresents the data, says Kathleen Neuzil, a physician and director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and can fuel incorrect assumptions about what a vaccine can and cannot do.“Anytime I see a single percentage in a headline, I get anxiety,” she says, “because it’s wrong.”The vaccines developed to protect against the novel coronavirus were measured in clinical trials against several endpoints, including their ability to protect against mild disease, severe disease, and death. When it comes to protecting against death, all three vaccines are 100 percent efficacious. In other words, not a single clinical trial participant died of COVID-19 after receiving full doses of the vaccines.Both the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines maintained their impressive efficacy of 100 percent in protecting against severe disease, but Johnson & Johnson’s dropped to 85 percent—and it dropped further when including mild COVID-19 disease, reaching 72 percent efficacy in U.S. trial participants.Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine was 95 percent efficacious against mild disease; Moderna’s vaccine reached 94 percent efficacy, but dropped to 86 percent for participants 65 and older.The AstraZeneca vaccine, which had an efficacy of 76 percent of preventing mild illness in U.S. trials, has not yet been authorized for emergency use in this country.But William Schaffner, a physician and professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, cautions against putting too much weight on the difference between efficacy rates because the vaccines “weren't trialed exactly cheek-to-cheek.”The trials of the currently authorized vaccines took place at different times, with Pfizer-BioNtech’s and Moderna’s ending before they could include the more easily transmissible COVID-19 variants that were first detected in the U.K. and Brazil. Johnson & Johnson’s trial included those variants. Experts don’t yet know how well the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines will fight the variants, though trials are underway.“When you’re considering the benefits of the vaccine, you’re not just looking at efficacy—you’re looking at the practical application of the vaccine, the delivery of the vaccines,” Chizoba Wonodi, an associate scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says. “Vaccines don’t save lives,” she explains. “Vaccinations save lives.”In an uneven vaccine rollout that has greatly benefited affluent and white people, many have been left behind. That includes people without transportation or childcare, those who work in essential jobs, and Black, brown, and Indigenous people. When it comes to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, some say its “delivery” makes it a logical choice to send to these harder-to-reach marginalized and vulnerable communities.“Right now, Black people, Latinx people, and Indigenous people are the people who are dying the most from COVID-19, but they have less access to the vaccine,” says Keisha Ray, an assistant professor and bioethicist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth.As of March 21, race and ethnicity were known for just 53 percent of people who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. But the data indicates marginalized groups are underrepresented in the distribution so far. For example, while Latino Americans represent more than 18 percent of the U.S. population, they’ve received just about 9 percent of the doses.When people come to her with concerns about the vaccines, Ray encourages them to take the vaccine that’s available to them. But while vaccine hesitancy is part of the problem, Ray says, it’s not the entire story. For these populations, “it’s not so much hesitancy as it is access,” she says, or lack thereof. Many Black and Latino Americans often lack necessities for vaccine access: transportation, Internet, paid time-off, and childcare. “All these things are difficult for people of color, who tend to work low-income jobs, who don’t have paid time-off,” Ray says.Unlike its predecessors, which require ultra-cold storage, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine needs to be stored only at refrigerator temperatures, making it accessible for hospitals and pharmacies that don’t have ultra-cold freezers and ideal for mobile vaccination efforts. If authorized for emergency use, the AstraZeneca vaccine would share this advantage: It too can be stored in a refrigerator for up to six months. So far, it’s been available outside the U.S., and has been critical to the World Health Organization’s campaign to vaccinate poor and middle-income countries.While Pfizer-BioNtech’s and Moderna’s vaccines require a two-dose regimen, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine requires only a single dose. This is a boon for people unable to take time off work, find childcare, or pay to park at a large medical facility, Ray says. And she adds that it also “lowers the risk of missing a second dose” for these groups.Nir Eyal, founder of the Center for Population-Level Bioethics at Rutgers University, says the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could be especially useful for transient populations, such as some homeless people, who might not be in the same place when it’s time for their second shot.All three COVID-19 vaccines share similar side effects: People may experience pain, redness, and swelling in their arms after injection, as well as fever, headache, chills, nausea, or tiredness. However, side effects can be more severe after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna’s vaccines—and on rare occasions, both have caused allergic reactions.Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine did not cause allergic reactions in its clinical trials. Even so, some people still have concerns about this vaccine.Ray, who is Black, understands why marginalized communities might be reluctant to embrace a vaccine that at first glance appears inferior but at the same time is being promoted by the medical community. “Black people, Latinx people, and Indigenous people have a horrible relationship with medicine and public health,” she says. “We’ve been experimented on. We’ve been tested on. We’ve been lied to. We’ve been misled.”Those same communities often face the most severe COVID-19 outcomes: Black and Hispanic Americans are about three times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 and about two times more likely to die from the disease than white Americans, according to data from the CDC. These same groups are overrepresented in jobs that put them on the frontlines of COVID-19 risk, including essential jobs such as grocery store employees and healthcare workers.If Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is widely available in these communities, “then that does look a little suspicious, as if people of color are sort of an afterthought,” Ray says.It’s unclear if current supplies will allow people or states to pick and choose which vaccines they accept and distribute. However, some policy makers may not accept shipments of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine; Detroit’s mayor recently spoke out against receiving the latest vaccines, saying the other vaccines are the “best” options for the city’s residents. (He later issued a statement saying that he had “full confidence” in Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.) Only four million doses have been shipped, and it’s unlikely more will be distributed until April.In the meantime, “we need to start creating spaces where we can promote dialogue and build trust,” says Claudia R. Sotomayor, bioethicist and assistant professor of internal medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. Without it, “it’s difficult to move forward.”Policy makers and healthcare providers can build trust with people who “perceive that they might be getting something inferior” by developing “really good public education as to what these various vaccines are able to do, both for them as individuals and their families and communities,” Lee says. “Transparency, and a real investment in public education about how important it is for folks to be vaccinated—regardless of which one they’re getting—is very, very important.”Ray says that she has concerns about how “perception of the vaccines among people of color and low-income communities” could affect the country’s journey to herd immunity. And Wonodi worries about what could happen to individuals if they shun a vaccine now for one they might get later.“People should not wait and say, I will come back in a week’s time,” Wonodi says. “You might get exposed to COVID-19 before you come back, and then you miss the chance to be protected.”She adds, “We have a lot more information about subtleties that really don't matter. Let’s not blow them out of proportion. The most sensible thing is to protect yourself as soon as you can.”Editor's Note: This article has been updated to correctly reflect the implications of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial efficacy rates.",
"Scientists are beginning to unravel what is sparking the rare but severe blood clotting reaction that has now been associated with both the Johnson & Johnson and the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines.Called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), this condition occurs when clots form in veins that route blood from the brain, causing strokes or other brain damage. Yesterday federal health officials recommended pausing the use of Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine after reports that six women in the United States suffered from blood clots in the brain within two weeks of vaccination. One of them died; another is hospitalized in critical condition. The pause comes on the heels of similar reports of CVST in patients in Europe who received the AstraZeneca vaccine.Blood clots are typically treated with the widely used blood thinner heparin. But that drug can make these vaccine-related clots worse with this syndrome, because the body reacts to heparin in a way that prompts it to make more clots instead of reducing them. That’s why experts say it is vital to distinguish these clots from the more common type and determine what underlying conditions make some people more vulnerable to developing CVST.Experts stress that people who’ve already gotten the vaccine shouldn’t panic. Nearly seven million Americans have already received a Johnson & Johnson shot, which means these adverse reactions are extremely rare. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to contact their doctor if they experience severe headaches, serious abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, all of which could indicate the presence of blood clots.“In most cases, there is a clear pattern of serious symptoms—it’s not like, I didn’t sleep well—and there’s a very tight window of about six to 14 days after vaccination, which is very helpful in diagnosing this,” says James Bussel, a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.According to current reports, the chance of experiencing this complication is only about one in a million cases, and experts say the benefits still far outweigh the risks of remaining unvaccinated.Pausing use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was done “out of an abundance of caution” and because of the unique treatment that these clots require, according to a joint statement from Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and Anne Schuchat, principle deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Johnson & Johnson also decided to pause ongoing clinical trials and delay the rollout of their vaccine in Europe while “working closely with medical experts and health authorities” and “reviewing these cases with European health authorities.”“We want to get this worked out as quickly as we possibly can and that’s why you see the world pause, in other words, you want to hold off for a bit,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a media briefing on Tuesday. “We want to leave that up to the FDA and the CDC to investigate this carefully.”When millions of people get vaccines, physicians expect several thousand will develop blood clots. But CVST is such an unusual case, according to Theodore Warkentin, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, and an expert on rare clots caused by heparin.He’s convinced the vaccines are the culprit because of a combination of factors. For one, the complications occurred within a week or two of the shot, and the extremely rare blood clots that formed in the veins that drain blood from the brain are indicative of CVST. Patients are also displaying a dual phenomenon of falling platelet counts while high quantities of antibodies attack the host platelets, a component in the blood that helps with coagulation.In two scientific papers that appeared last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, a team of European and Canadian scientists evaluated several clotting cases that cropped up in Europe with the AstraZeneca vaccine; one team found this condition resembles an unusual side effect, called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), that is triggered by the drug.Because of the similarity to HIT, researchers are now calling the new disorder “vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).”“The vaccine is clearly linked to this rare complication,” says Warkentin, who is a coauthor on one of the NEJM papers. “We have a smoking gun.”We don’t know as yet if there are some genetic determinants or other obvious predispositions that might make people more susceptible to developing this condition. “We know from HIT research that we can’t predict who will develop this disorder,” says Warkentin.What is known is that it tends to strike younger women. All six patients in the U.S. were women between the ages of 18 and 48, and the vast majority of patients in Europe were less than 60 years old. Experts can’t say for sure, but they do have some clues as to why.“It is not yet known whether oral contraceptives are the common denominator,” says Nigel Key, director of the hemophilia and thrombosis center at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He adds that other possibilities might make women more susceptible to clots, such as previous pregnancies.Symptoms of VITT are relatively easy to identify, and there is a combination of tests that can determine whether a patient is experiencing this rare blood clot.A blood test can determine if platelet counts are low, for example, and imaging tests, such as an MRI, can confirm if there is neurological damage. A therapy called intravenous immunoglobulin, a blood product that is used to shore up antibody deficiencies, given with non-heparin anticoagulants could break up the clots.“This is a serious condition if one gets it, and the severe forms can be quite dangerous,” says Warkentin. “But it is treatable.”Researchers are gaining some insights into the mechanism behind the blood clots by studying the similar reactions to the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is formulated using the same technology as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. As of April 4, EudraVigilance, the European Union’s drug safety database, had reports of 169 total cases of CVST in some 34 million people in Europe and the U.K. who had been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot.It still isn’t clear why one type of vaccine causes these dangerous side effects while the others don’t, although some scientists believe the strategy used by both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson may play a role.All the current coronavirus vaccines are designed to provoke the immune system into making antibodies against a key protein on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This spike protein sits on the surface of the virus and binds to the ACE2 protein on human cells. Both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines use fragments of DNA to instruct human cells how to produce the spike protein. Both also use modified cold viruses, called adenoviruses, to deliver these bits of genetic material to the recipient’s cells.When cells receive the genetic instructions, they churn out spike proteins. The immune system sees the spike proteins as foreign intruders and dispatches antibodies that will recognize the real SARS-CoV-2 viruses and block them from binding and infecting cells. By contrast, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines use messenger RNA technology to deliver genetic instructions to make the spike protein, and don’t use adenoviruses or DNA.The clotting syndrome itself is now believed to be triggered by an intense immune system reaction to the vaccine, which somehow prompts the production of antibodies that activate platelets.“This is such a peculiar constellation of things,” says Alfred Lee, a hematologist and program director for the hematology/oncology fellowship program at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, “that it’s probably a real mechanism specific to the vaccines.”",
"On Christmas mornings, the tree at the Wray family is typically packed with presents of all sizes. “But with the inflation and the layoffs in tech, we’ve been thinking of scaling back,” says Helen Fang, a mother of two in San Carlos, California.Some gifts for their three-and-a-half-year-old will come from Facebook’s Buy Nothing group. Helen and her husband, Ed Wray, were more upfront with their 15-year-old. “We’ve had a conversation about what she wants and are really focusing on two items.”The Wray family is not alone in being conservative with spending this holiday season. Mass layoffs have been sweeping across multiple industries, including tech, media, health care, and real estate. Inflation rates have risen 8.2 percent over the past 12 months, resulting in higher prices for everything from gas to grocery staples.With less discretionary income, many parents are choosing to spend less on holiday gifts. According to a report from Deloitte, consumers plan on shopping less in 2022—and purchasing nearly half the number of gifts bought in 2021. That means children might end up with fewer toys or not getting the expensive gift they had their hearts set on.And that’s going to leave a lot of kids really disappointed. However, learning to cope with disappointment is an important life skill. Here are some ways parents can help their children cope with their feelings so they can still enjoy this most wonderful time of the year.Located in the “emotional control center” of the brain, the amygdala perceives any big emotion a child feels as a threat. “A chain of events, also called the fight-or-flight response, then occurs that prepares the body to respond to that threat,” says Sarah Conway, a psychologist in Wollongong, Australia, and owner of Mindful Little Minds. “During this time, stress hormones in the body increase, and the area of the brain responsible for thinking, reasoning, and planning goes offline.”For children, that’s because the area of the brain responsible for impulse control and logical thinking doesn’t fully develop until people are in their mid-20s. “Much of their behavior in these moments is out of their conscious control, as the brain is focused only on survival,” Conway says.So when a child is disappointed, they’re literally unable to access reason. Unlike adults who think with their prefrontal cortex—the rational decision-making part of the brain—children use their more reactive amygdala, or emotional brain. “When kids want something, they want it now,” Conway says. “They have no ability to wait or delay gratification.”Conway adds that children also haven’t had a lot of practice when it comes to managing their emotions. “So when they don’t get what they want, it might be the worst thing that has happened in their short lives,” she says. “Or at the very least, that’s what it feels to them.”Disappointment is caused when reality does not live up to expectations, and the feeling can manifest in various ways. Some children may throw tantrums or withdraw; others may steal or show aggression.Those reactions, of course, will not serve them well as adults. So when children learn to cope with disappointment, they also learn to self-regulate strong emotions, says Melissa Hunt, children’s program supervisor at St. Clair County Community Mental Health in Port Huron, Michigan.“We hate to see our kids disappointed. And it would be really amazing if we could just take that feeling away and make everything perfect,” says Hunter Clarke-Fields, author of Raising Good Humans. “But we do our children a disservice when we try to protect them from all the uncomfortable feelings.”When kids are overly protected, they get into early adulthood unprepared to handle life’s pains and difficulties. And they end up as anxious and overwhelmed young adults. Research has suggested that parents of anxious children tend to have more negative expectations of their children’s ability to cope with stressful situations and are more likely to intervene for their children when they display negative emotions or are in distress.“It’s healthy for kids—with loving support of their parents—to go through uncomfortable feelings and realize how they can handle it,” Clarke-Fields says.Disappointment is an inevitable human experience, but parents can take this opportunity to guide their child through a difficult period. “At some point, we’re all going to be let down,” says Lindsey Rosen, a Denver-based postdoctoral fellow in developmental psychology. “And if kids can learn to manage disappointment, then they can learn how to respond in productive ways.” Here are some tips to start the conversation.Be honest. Clarke-Fields suggests sharing the potentially disappointing news with your child honestly and directly, and provide an age-appropriate explanation for why the child is going to have to wait for their gift—or not receive it at all. For instance: “I really wish I could have gotten you this, but I couldn’t this year,”or “The teddy bear is on a long boat ride and will arrive in the spring.”Accept their emotions. Allow your child to experience their disappointment, then validate their feelings. “Don’t belittle the child or tell them to ‘just toughen up,’” says Linda A. Camras, professor emerita in psychology at DePaul University’s College of Science and Health in Chicago.That includes trying to change their feelings or talk them out of being disappointed. Camras also advises against telling kids that they should be grateful for what they do have. “As parents, our job is to be as present as you can be and listen,” Clarke-Fields says. “It’s not like there’s anything to change at that point.”Label the feelings. The most important thing, especially for younger kids, is to name the feeling. “If a kid finds out they’re not getting a gift, they may not feel sad right away. They might be angry, frustrated, confused, or acting out of control,” Rosen says. “The kid might be feeling all of those things for the first time.”Instead, help children name that experience: You’re feeling disappointed. “Now, the kid has the vocabulary and the ability to put a name to the feeling,” Rosen says. “That’s a huge step toward emotional intelligence.”Understand the true disappointment. Adults sometimes make an assumption that child is disappointed for a certain reason, when it’s really something else. For example, a parent might assume their child is disappointed that a bicycle didn’t appear under the tree, but they’re actually sad about not being able to join their friends on a bike ride.“Spend time helping kids unpack that moment so that they have the opportunity to connect with what they’re thinking, feeling, noticing, and doing,” says Andrea Hussong, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Clarke-Fields suggests going for a walk with your child or coloring side by side, so your child doesn’t feel the pressure of a face-to-face conversation.Set realistic expectations. If you haven’t already, don’t overpromise for the holidays. “Giving children a list of realistic options can lead to less disappointment in the end,” Hunt says. (If you have overpromised, refer back to tip one.)Practice soothing techniques. Try deep breathing, coloring, writing, or even crumbling paper. Hunt suggests practicing these soothing techniques anytime a stressful situation comes up. “It’s like a fire drill,” she says. “Practice these techniques before the crisis allows children to use them when the time is right.”Model good self-regulation. Camras urges parents not to get upset themselves when a child is disappointed, but instead share their feelings and demonstrate healthy coping strategies. (“I’m also feeling disappointed that I don’t get to watch you open your gifts.”)“That’s showing the kid that this is a healthy, normal emotion that everybody feels,” Rosen says. “It’s a part of life, and it’s not so much about if we’re going to experience it, but how we respond to it.”This article was originally published in November 2021, and has been updated with new statistics about holiday spending habits.",
"By the time Choncé Maddox’s son was in first grade, she already felt like she was drowning in stuff—he had so many toys and games that she couldn’t keep track of them all.“Buying a ton of stuff will only lead to wanting more stuff,” says Maddox, a personal finance writer and blogger. “It won't improve your mood long-term or stop you from being bored on the weekends. I wanted to teach this to my son early so he wouldn't grow up thinking he could buy his way to happiness.”That’s why Maddox started emphasizing doing more instead of buying more.Research suggests that an emphasis on money and material goods during childhood can shape our materialistic values as adults. And though kids need to understand where money comes from and how you earn it, the belief that acquiring more stuff is the key to happiness can be harmful to kids’ development.“We gravitate to material things because it gives us this boost of happiness,” says Lan Nguyen Chaplin, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “But we're caught in this cycle of thinking, ‘If I could just have that toy or that shirt, I'd be happier.’”As many Americans are expecting cash in the form of stimulus checks in the coming weeks, it could be a great opportunity to start a conversation with kids about financial values. Here’s how materialism can negatively impact kids, and how parents can teach them better ways to spend.Youth materialism is strongly associated with low self-esteem, as well as depression, anxiety, decreased motivation, and selfish behaviors. Similarly, materialistic adults tend to be more insecure, less generous, and report lower subjective well-being.Researchers suggest that this relationship is circular. In other words, feelings of low self-esteem may fuel the desire for material goods that we think will make us happy and symbolize success. But when those goods fail to live up to our expectations, we feel even more dissatisfied, and the pattern of wanting and buying continues.And initially, it does give you a jolt of joy—until you want the next best thing.In fact, neuroimaging research suggests that shopping can activate our brains’ reward systems and release the feel-good chemical dopamine—but these effects are only temporary. Dopamine is also associated with learning; when something makes us feel good, we’re more likely to repeat the behavior.Young people’s developing brains may actually be more sensitive to these rewards. For example, the nucleus accumbens, known as the brain’s pleasure center, shows peak activity during adolescence.The good news: Parents can counteract some of the materialistic messaging that children receive from peers and marketers. “The secret here lies in spending time with your kids, communicating with them, and fostering a positive sense of self,” Chaplin says.Avoid using material goods as punishment and reward. Parents can then unwittingly reinforce materialistic messages through something called material parenting, or using material goods as a reward for good behavior and taking them away as punishment for bad behavior. This is a common strategy, Chaplin explains. “But in the long run, there's this focus on material things, and kids grow up to place a greater emphasis on material things as a sign of success and achievement.”In one study, Chaplin and her colleagues asked adults to recall the degree to which their parents used material goods as rewards or punishment for different behaviors. The participants whose parents relied on this strategy were more likely to judge other people's success based on the products they have and how much they own.Talk about advertising. A study by the American Psychological Association found that each year the average child watches more than 40,000 commercials, which often suggest that possessions are directly related to happiness, beauty, and success. That may lead to materialistic behavior being used as a coping mechanism when children don’t live up to advertising ideals.“Kids don't even realize what an advertisement is when they're young—they just see something and they think it's great,” says Marsha Richins, professor of marketing at the University of Missouri.Studies have found that forewarning kids about manipulative advertising content can increase their skepticism and reduce their desire for the product. Chaplin says that parents can help them by fact-checking claims and showing them how to think critically about products. For example, if you’re watching a show together and see an ad for a new phone, it’s the perfect opportunity to say: I wouldn’t buy that phone because I have one that works perfectly fine.Focus on building self-esteem. Instead of focusing on material goods as markers of success, help kids focus on building what Richins calls “intangible resources.” Encourage them to develop friendships and pursue interests that boost their self-esteem without relying on material goods—this shows them that success and achievement don’t necessarily come from buying things.Materialism is highly correlated with low self-esteem, Chaplin adds. A great way to foster self-esteem is by spending quality time with kids and participating in activities they love. “They're not going to feel like they need to attach themselves to fleeting objects for a self-esteem boost if they already have a high self-esteem.”In general, income isn’t a strong predictor of happiness, but we know from studies in adults that we can spend our extra cash in ways that are more likely to make us happy. So while kids probably don’t have their own source of income yet, parents can start building these habits now.Talk to kids about wants versus needs. Help children understand the value of products, and by extension, how to prioritize spending, Chaplin says. For instance, when a child asks for something, she recommends opening up a conversation about wants and needs: why what they want is unique, how much it costs, and how much of their own money they would need to save to get it. “You'd be surprised how carefully they think about needs and wants when it’s their money,” she says. Kids usually end up seeing more value in saving up for something they really want.Practice gratitude and giving. Higher levels of gratitude are associated with lower levels of materialism. Researchers suggest this is because gratitude boosts feelings of security, well-being, and generosity, which in turn reduces the emphasis on material goods as a means of comfort and happiness. In addition to decreasing materialism, gratitude is related to better school performance, lower levels of depression, and stronger social connection.In one study, Chaplin and her colleagues asked adolescents to write down who and what they were thankful for in a gratitude journal every day. “After about two weeks, they felt like they needed fewer things in their lives,” she says. “And not only that but they felt like they needed to share what they have with others.”Parents can build gratitude into their family lifestyle by doing things like donating toys kids don’t play with anymore. “Children see they have all these excess material goods, and they can share it with people who don't have enough.”Invest in experiences—and help kids remember them. Research in adults consistently shows that experiential purchases lead to longer-lasting happiness because people tend to connect over their shared experiences—not their material possessions. That said, very young children typically get more happiness from material things. So when do children make the switch? It has to do with brain development.“I often hear parents complaining about how they shouldn't have taken their kids to Europe because the kids didn't appreciate it,” Chaplin says. “But the child's memory skills are just inefficient at a certain age.” Unlike tangible objects, experiences tend to be fleeting and abstract—and little kids simply don’t remember them very well.As children get older, their memory and recall get better, and they’re able to handle abstract information. That’s when they learn to appreciate experiences better. “They understand that people don't really like to have conversations about your newest sneakers, but they want to hear about what you did this weekend,” Chaplin explains.Parents can help younger kids start learning to appreciate experiences by helping them remember. Souvenirs or gifts are concrete objects that can remind them of a family vacation, but you can also create memories for free, Chaplin says. She recommends taking photos and videos of birthday parties, vacations, and family time so you can look back at them together. Because when children start to remember pleasant experiences, they’re more likely to make future choices that increase happiness.",
"No plans to get out of town for spring break? No problem.We’ve created a sampler of seven different staycation activities, one for each day of the week and all with a learning component. But don’t worry … these ideas are so fun your kid won’t figure that out.DISCOVER what biodiversity means—and what kids can do to preserve it. Researching national parks can show children why biological diversity (the variety of life in a place or on Earth) is important for the health of plants, animals, and humans. A great place to explore biodiversity is the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park’s mix of plant-covered mountains, abundant rainfall, and high summer humidity nurtures a mind-boggling variety of life that’s reliant on the health of the entire ecosystem, including synchronous fireflies and 30 species of salamanders. Show kids how the park’s careful monitoring of human impact on the land also helps preserve its biodiversity.DO: Fill kids’ backpacks with trail snacks, a water bottle, and a naturalist’s notebook (paper and markers). Then, hike into your yard or a corner of your house to find and observe "pocket worlds," little spots of nature in places like flower beds or houseplants. Examining these spaces gives kids a glimpse of how teeming with life the world can be, says Logan Rosenberg, youth programs manager with the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont. “It’s amazing how when you slow down and get down, you see such variety of life,” he says.DISCOVER how exploring other cultures helps kids see things from different perspectives. At home, research international destinations based on something they love or dream about doing. Chocolate? Switzerland. Pyramids? Egypt. Soaring like a superhero? South Africa (home to some crazy-long ziplines).DO: Pick three places to “visit” over one big globetrotting day. Eat, play, and live like families in each country. Rearrange furniture and use pillows and other items to recreate traditional living spaces: Mongolian yurt, Japanese tatami room, Finnish family sauna, etc. Practice local cultural etiquette; for instance, in Croatia, family members greet each other with a kiss on both cheeks. Learn some words in the local language, such as thank you (asante in Swahili) and ice cream (dondurma in Turkish). Play a popular game like Hacky-Sack-ish jegi chagi in South Korea or football (the soccer kind) most everywhere. (Here are some other popular international games.) For meals, make kid-friendly versions of culturally distinct street foods, such as South African bunny chow, curry served in a scooped-out quarter-loaf of white bread.DISCOVER how humans and warming seas are changing the ocean and affecting the animals that live there. Observe sharks and other marine creatures with Google’s Underwater Street View and see if your kids can spot any damage (like bleached coral). Use the U.S. Geological Survey’s water cycle for kids to talk about how keeping trash out of rivers and creeks close to home helps keep the ocean healthy.DO: Wear sunglasses and bathing suits. Pump wave sounds through a smart speaker or phone. Then look at an unspoiled ocean (a big glass bowl filled with water). Have kids add beachy things—sunscreen, bits of paper, plastic straws—to observe how skincare chemicals and other ocean trash hurts the ocean. Take a litter walk around your neighborhood to help prevent debris from reaching the sea.DISCOVER how light litterbugs—things that create too much artificial light in the night sky—affect the natural behavior of sea turtles and other cool creatures (including humans!). Check out Dark Skies for Kids to connect light pollution to things that matter to kids. Work together to create a  night-sky-friendly home by only using outdoor lighting when and where you need it. “Light glaring up into the night sky is equivalent to a sprinkler spraying water onto a sidewalk—it’s wasteful,” says Bettymaya Foott of the International Dark Sky Association.DO: Pitch a tent or build a blanket fort. Download a stargazing app to create a portable planetarium. After dark, go outside and point the app skyward. Identify twinkling objects kids can see overhead then check out the stargazing wonders—like meteor showers, the Milky Way, and Jupiter’s moons—they can’t see because of light pollution.DISCOVER how STEAM-based (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) activities bring creative ideas to life as theme park attractions. Take a virtual tour of Walt Disney Imagineering to help kids start connecting stuff they’re learning in school to what engineers use to design and create fast, fun, and—sometimes—white-knuckle scary rides.DO: Go all-in on the theme park concept. Find wacky hats and other silly gear to wear. Turn the kitchen table into a workshop equipped with paper, scissors, a tablet or laptop, and other theme park-design tools. Craft mini versions of Sleeping Beauty Castle and King Arthur Carrousel (it spins!) using these cut-and-paste activity sheets. Older kids can take a deeper dive into ride design using this two-hour, project-based course. (The Walt Disney Company is majority owner of National Geographic Partners.)DISCOVER exhibits matching your child’s interests—art, dinosaurs, music, whatever!—by taking virtual museum tours. Exploring world-class institutions like the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History can encourage kids to want to learn more about a subject—and to visit museums.DO: Check out the Field Museum’s Science Hub at Home projects, which challenge kids to think like scientists (dino-obsessed kids will also enjoy the Mission to the Mesozoic learning game). After your tour, make your own family museum: Give everyone gallery space to curate and display an exhibit on something they collect or are curious about—comic books, slime, crawly bugs. Host an opening, complete with sparkling grape juice, cheese cubes, and other museum-y finger foods. Take turns describing your exhibits and sharing fun facts.DISCOVER why geography—basically, looking at where things are and why they’re there—is way cooler than what you might’ve learned in school. “Geography is so much more than memorizing state capitals on a map,” says Nancee Hunter, director of Oregon’s Center for Geography Education. “It’s about looking at the interaction between people and places.” And that, Hunter explains, helps kids understand all sorts of things, from climate change to why we eat what we do.DO: Brainstorm ideas for where to go. Use Google Maps street view to plot the route together, then pile into the “back seat” (a comfy couch) for a virtual ride. Try a world-famous road trip route like Iceland’s Ring Road. Go slow so kids can build an awareness of place by noticing what’s out the window: trees, buildings, landforms, weather. “Stop” the car to ask questions and look up answers: Why is the state line in the middle of a river? Where are the trees? How did Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, get its name?",
"A blood moon, an evocative nickname for a total lunar eclipse, hangs over Mount Rainier in Washington State.Despite a year filled with lockdowns and social isolation, the starry skies of 2020 gave us solace and enthralled us with a parade of eye-catching celestial events. The astronomical calendar this past year was packed full of memorable sights, including the surprise appearance of the bright comet NEOWISE, the decade’s best views of Mars, a Halloween blue moon, and a much-anticipated historically close encounter between Jupiter and Saturn.Scores of amazing astronomical phenomena are also in the offing throughout 2021. Here are our picks for the predicted celestial events worth circling on your calendar in the new year.Early risers will be rewarded with a close encounter between two of the brightest planets in our skies: Venus and Jupiter. Both planets will appear as brilliant dots to the naked eye, and the pair will seem to be so close in the sky that they will be visible at the same time through a backyard telescope. As an added bonus, the planet Saturn will be drifting to the pair’s upper right.Be prepared to scout out a good observing spot with an unobstructed view of the southeast horizon, as this celestial pairing will occur near the rising sun, and spotting it will be all about timing. The trick is to allow the planets to rise high enough in the morning sky to observe them just before the light of dawn drowns out your view. The best time to see them will be about 20 to 30 minutes before sunrise. People in the Southern Hemisphere will have the best opportunity to see the event because the planets will be positioned farther from the sun and therefore higher in the sky.An impressive cosmic huddle will greet sky-watchers around the globe as four worlds cluster in the southeast morning sky. Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn will all appear in near-perfect alignment, while the nearby crescent moon will frame the trio of planets. Each planet will appear as a brilliant dot, with Mercury being the faintest and Jupiter the brightest—all easily visible to the naked eye.Through binoculars, stargazers will be able to spot Jupiter’s four largest moons, while a small telescope will reveal Saturn’s rings. Because of Earth’s position relative to Mercury and the sun, only half of the innermost planet's disk will appear illuminated to us. As a result, Mercury will look like a miniature version of the quarter moon through the telescope.Across western North America, western South America, Australia, and southeast Asia, people will be able to witness the moon blush red as it undergoes a total lunar eclipse. This dramatic astronomical event happens when the sun, Earth, and moon are precisely aligned so that our planet's shadow completely blankets the moon’s face.During the total part of the eclipse, sunlight shining through the ring of Earth's dusty atmosphere is bent, or refracted, toward the red part of the spectrum and cast onto the moon's surface. As a result, the moon will transform from a dark gray color during the partial phase of the eclipse to a reddish-orange color during totality. The moon's exact color can vary depending on the amount of dust in Earth's atmosphere.This total lunar eclipse coincides with the moon being at its closest point to Earth in its egg-shaped orbit—sometimes called a supermoon—so the lunar disk will also be bigger and brighter than an average full moon. The partial eclipse begins at 1:44 a.m. Pacific time, when the first hint of Earth’s shadow will start to cover the moon. The total eclipse, when the moon appears to turn red, will begin at 3:11 a.m. and end at 3:25 a.m.Any people along a narrow path running north from Canada, into part of Greenland, and into Russia will get to see a “ring of fire” eclipse just as the sun rises. Also known as an annular solar eclipse, this stunning event occurs when the moon, sun, and Earth are aligned so that the lunar disk is too small to cover the entire sun, leaving a ring of light around the dark lunar silhouette. The full eclipse path starts at 9:49 UT over northern Canada and ends in Russia at 11:33 UT.While it may be difficult for most people to make it into the ring of fire’s remote path, millions will be well placed to witness the related partial solar eclipse, when large parts of Asia, Europe, and North America will see part of the sun blocked by the moon. If you are viewing either the annular or partial eclipse, remember to never look at the sun directly without proper eye protection, such as solar filter glasses.After local sunset, these two bright planets will appear to touch in the sky. The pair will be joined by a crescent moon, making for an eye-catching photo opportunity.Similar to the great conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn in December 2020, Mars and Venus will be so close they will be visible through a backyard telescope at the same time. Venus will be the easiest to spot as an unmistakably bright star-like object. Ruddy Mars will appear much fainter, so you may not notice it at first due to Venus’s glare. After your eyes adjust, however, the two should be easy to see with the unaided eye, separated by space equal to the width of a full moon.Every mid-August, Earth travels through a cloud of debris shed by the comet Swift–Tuttle, producing a flurry of shooting stars in the skies as small meteors burn up in the upper atmosphere. This is the Perseid meteor shower, and it can produce up to 60 shooting stars an hour in a typical year.This year promises to be particularly good for the Perseids, since the shower’s peak will coincide with a dark, moonless sky. A thin crescent moon will set during the early evening, ushering in excellent viewing conditions later in the night. The Northern Hemisphere is favored since the meteors always appear to radiate from their namesake constellation Perseus, which lies close to the horizon this time of year for those in far southern latitudes.To get the best view of this celestial fireworks show, scout out a viewing spot with as little light pollution as possible. Even from a suburban backyard or park, dozens of shooting stars should be visible each hour under clear skies.A close encounter will transpire between the innermost planet of the solar system, little Mercury, and the fourth planet from the sun, ruddy Mars. This dramatic conjunction will be a bit tricky to catch because of its close proximity to the setting sun, so you’ll need a clear line of sight toward the western horizon. Mercury will appear brighter than Mars, since it will be illuminated more by the sun. If you can spot the conjunction through a telescope, these two planets will appear squeezed together so closely that they can both be viewed at high magnification, providing detailed views of the two worlds together.The Draconids will sparkle in the high northwest skies after nightfall with about 10 to 15 shooting stars an hour. This flurry of meteors comes from a stream of sand grain-size particles spread along the orbit of comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. With only a small sliver of moon to compete, the relatively dark skies will help sky-watchers enjoy these flashes of cometary debris.Like most other meteor showers, the Draconids are named after the constellation from which they appear to radiate—in this case, Draco, the dragon. The Draconids are best viewed from nightfall to midnight, when the shooting stars will appear highest in the sky. At the shower's peak, Draco will be nearly overhead around local midnight throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The dragon's shooting stars are fairly easy to spot since they are some of the slowest moving of any annual shower.The last lunar eclipse of the year will greet sky watchers across North and South America, Australia, and parts of Europe and Asia. While it is technically a partial eclipse, up to 95 percent of the full moon will be cast within Earth’s dark shadow. During the maximum phase, it should briefly appear as a total eclipse, which means the lunar disk may show hints of orange or red. The eclipse will start at 2:18 a.m. EST, and Earth’s shadow will envelop most of the moon’s visible surface by 4:02 a.m. EST.Intrepid travelers looking for the ultimate eclipse-chasing adventure will have their chance at the end of 2021, when a total solar eclipse will unfold across Antarctica. Meanwhile, a partial eclipse of the sun will be visible across parts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Namibia, and Australia. Viewers using solar-filtered glasses in these regions will get to see a bite taken out of the sun as the moon partially obscures the solar disk.Some cruise ships and airlines will head straight into the path of totality, where the entire disk of the sun will be covered by the moon, dramatically darkening the surrounding environment for a few precious minutes. Those who make the trek to the southernmost part of the world will have an opportunity to capture the eclipsed sun near the horizon in the early morning hours, with icebergs and icy tundra in the foreground—a terrific way to round out the year.",
"Far from city lights in New Hampshire, the Comet NEOWISE put on a spectacle on Sunday, July 12. The comet tail was visible to the naked eye, but fainter and smaller than what you see in this single 15-second exposure.A comet called NEOWISE is paying a visit to Earth’s neighborhood this month, and astronomers say it may end up ranking as one of the brightest comets seen in our skies in more than a decade.The comet is currently bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, if you know where to look. It’s already delighting sky-watchers across the Northern Hemisphere who have been rising before dawn to gaze at the glowing celestial traveler.Chris Schur, an astrophotographer based in Payson, Arizona, describes the comet as “gorgeous.” When he trained his binoculars on it on the morning of July 7, he estimated that its tail spanned about five degrees in length, which is about 10 times the apparent size of the full moon. If the tail continues to grow, which astronomers say is possible, “it could be very dramatic,” Schur says.For the next week or so, NEOWISE will be strictly a predawn target. To see it, head outside at least 45 minutes before sunrise and look just above the northeastern horizon. The bright star Capella can serve as a marker, as the comet lies just below it, while the brilliant planet Venus is visible to the east. In about a week’s time, the comet will transition to the evening sky, making it even easier to spot. Beginning around mid-July, the comet will be visible in the northwestern sky after sunset, arcing slowly upward beneath the stars of the Big Dipper.To have the best chance of glimpsing the celestial transient, a little planning goes a long way. “It’s not like you’re just going to glance up and, Oh wow, there it is!” says Dave Schleicher, a senior astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. “You need to have a good idea of where to look—and binoculars will help.”Still, judging by photos posted on social media over the past few days, the comet is putting on a quite a show—arguably the best since Comet Hale-Bopp, which lit up the night sky in 1997. Comet McNaught, which passed by Earth in 2007, was also brighter than NEOWISE is now, but it was primarily visible from the Southern Hemisphere.“The buzz around this comet is justified,” says photographer Malcolm Park, who captured an image of NEOWISE and its tail from his home in eastern Ontario on the morning of July 5.Named for the space telescope used to discover it in late March, the comet’s full official moniker is C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE). It made its closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, on July 3, and the fact that the comet is still visible at all has sky-watchers breathing a sigh of relief. Many comets don’t survive the heat of a close approach to our host star. Comets, often described as “dirty snowballs,” are made up of rock, dust, gases, and ice—a combination that doesn’t always hold together in extreme temperatures.“As it comes closer to the sun, it heats up, it blows off all kinds of material, and you get a spectacular tail,” says Laura Danly, curator of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. “But sometimes they just fall apart completely, and they disappear.”NEOWISE seems to be a survivor, emerging from its encounter with the sun sporting a long tail of gas and dust. “We’ve already gone past that point of closest approach, and the comet is still there,” Danly says. “So we can hope for another month of good viewing.”Comet NEOWISE was captured over Lebanon in this composite image, composed of photos taken on July 8.Several factors determine the comet’s brightness. Having passed the sun, it’s now reflecting less of the star’s light toward us, but it is also getting closer to Earth. NEOWISE will make its closest approach on July 22, when it comes within 64 million miles of our home planet. After that, it will gradually fade from view as it heads back to the outer reaches of the solar system.To catch the best view, should you get up early to see the comet this week, or wait until later in the month when it’s more conveniently positioned in the evening sky? Many sky-watchers, fearing that the comet’s show may be fleeting, suggest setting a morning alarm and seeing the comet as soon as possible. And with many people feeling a bit stir-crazy due to the pandemic, a passing comet might be the perfect excuse to get outside and engage with nature, Danly says.“Get your kids up early, if you have them, or get yourself up early, and go see this beautiful sight,” she says. “And maybe stay for the sunrise.”",
"Jupiter and Saturn shine on a clear July night over a lavender field near the village of Brihuega, Spain. In December 2020, the two planets will appear the closest as seen from Earth since 1623.Stargazers are in for a rare treat in the days just head of Christmas, as two of the solar system’s brightest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, engage in a celestial dance that will bring them within planetary kissing distance in the evening sky.The moment of closest approach arrives on December 21—the winter solstice for those in the Northern Hemisphere and the start of summer for those in the Southern Hemisphere. The two planets will appear closer together than at any time in almost 400 years in an event known as a great conjunction.Best of all, the spectacle, which will be visible from all over the world, can be enjoyed without any special equipment—just look southwest, as soon as the sky gets dark. Those with access to a telescope are in for an additional rare treat: With a typical amateur instrument set to low power, the two giant planets will fit within a single field-of-view. Jupiter, with its four bright moons, and Saturn, with its distinctive rings, will be visible all at once.But there’s no need to wait to get out there and start looking. “It’ll be infinitely more fun to watch throughout the month, rather than just going out on December 21,” says Laura Danly, curator of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. “You’ll see those two lights, Jupiter and Saturn, getting closer and closer and closer, until on the 21st, they’re just one-tenth of a degree apart”—about a fifth of the width of the full moon as seen in our sky.That's pretty close, considering you can cover the entire lunar disk easily with an outstretched thumb. Even so, most observers should be able to distinguish the two planets. “If your eyesight is good enough to drive, then you’ll be able to see that [Jupiter and Saturn are] two separate objects,” even at their closest approach in the sky, Danly says.Astronomers call such a close planetary pairing a conjunction. Jupiter-Saturn pairings occur about once every 20 years, and because of their rarity are referred to as “great conjunctions.” By comparison, conjunctions involving the inner planets Mercury and Venus—with each other or with one of the outer planets—are much more common, occurring many times per decade.The further a planet is from the sun, the slower it moves across our sky—and Jupiter and Saturn are the two most distant planets that can be readily seen with the unaided eye. (Saturn, more distant than Jupiter as well as physically smaller, is the fainter of the two.) Jupiter completes one revolution around the sun every 12 years, while Saturn takes about 30 years—a celestial playbook that results in their meeting in the sky every two decades.Not all Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions are created equal, however. Their orbits don’t lie in precisely the same plane. (If they did, Jupiter would literally block our view of Saturn every 20 years.) Typically, the planets pass above or below each other in the sky, separated by a couple degrees. This year, though the two giant planets will appear right next to each other from our perspective on Earth, they will actually be several hundred million miles apart.Jupiter and Saturn last lined up as closely as this in 1623, roughly a dozen years after Galileo first aimed a telescope at the night sky and discovered Jupiter’s four largest moons. But there was a catch: “That one wouldn’t have been easy to see, because the two planets would have been so close to the sun in the sky,” says Kevin Schindler of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. (This was also the case during the last great conjunction in 2000.)“You have to go all the way back to the year 1226 to find one that was visible, and was this close.” The next comparably close conjunction will be in 2080.Throughout history, people have taken note of planetary conjunctions, often attributing astrological significance to the phenomenon. In his epic poem Troilus and Criseyde, for example, Geoffrey Chaucer described a great conjunction that took place in 1385, writing that “Saturn and Jove, in [the constellation] Cancer joined were that such a rain from heaven poured down.” Some astrologers predicted a worldwide cataclysm—which, needless to say, did not transpire.Today we know that although the planets do exert a small gravitational tug on one another, their effect on our own planet is negligible, so we can relax and enjoy the show—or try to photograph it.To get a really good shot “takes substantial practice and experimenting, and reasonably good equipment,” says Bradley Schaefer, an astronomer at Louisiana State University. While your smartphone’s camera might show two dots in the sky, those with a digital single-lens reflex camera, or at least a camera with a zoom lens that attaches to a tripod, will likely get better results.“You’ll definitely want to use a tripod, and you should plan in advance where you’ll be shooting from,” Schaefer says. Just make sure you have an unobstructed view to the southwest.And if it’s cloudy, have no fear—a number of observatories, including Lowell in Arizona, will be livestreaming the event.We know the planets are always in motion, but a conjunction puts that movement in the spotlight. The great conjunction of 2020 will be a chance to see the solar system as an ever-changing stage on which the planets strut their stuff. “When you watch from night to night,” Danly says, “you get a feel for just how dynamic the solar system is.”",
"Snow hikers watch the nearly full moon rise behind the Weissfluhjoch summit in Arosa, Switzerland, during the December solstice in 2010.Shortening days and falling temperatures are heralding the arrival of winter across the Northern Hemisphere.This year, the northern winter solstice falls on December 21 at 11:19 p.m. ET (04:19 UT). The solstice happens at the same moment around the world, though its local time depends on which of the 24 times zones you call home. And south of the Equator, the December solstice marks the onset of summer.For people in the north, is the year's shortest day also the official beginning of winter? Why does the solstice occur anyway, and how have people observed it over the ages? Read on for everything you need to know about the December solstice.The reason for the solstice—and the seasons—is that Earth is tilted with respect to the sun at an average of 23.5 degrees. This means the Northern and Southern Hemispheres receive unequal amounts of sunlight over a year as we orbit our star.Each hemisphere cools down during the part of the year it's tilted away from the sun. The winter solstice (December in the north, June in the south) arrives at the time when that tilt is at its most extreme angle.This astronomical event appears on calendars as the first day of winter—but meteorologists have already gotten a head start on the season. By the time the solstice rolls around, climate scientists have been observing winter for nearly a month, says Greg Hammer of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.“Meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere is always the months of December, January, and February, because those tend to be the coldest months of the year,” he says. “It's entirely based on the annual temperature cycle, rather than astronomically based.”Considering sunlight's enormous influence on Earth's climate, why isn't the darkest part of the year also the coldest?“Basically, it takes a while for water and landmasses to cool down from all the heat they have absorbed” during summer, Hammer says. “So, the minimum of daylight isn't followed by the coldest temperatures until about a month later. It varies from place to place, but around the third week in January tends to have the coldest temperatures of the year for most of the U.S.”Meteorological winter more closely mirrors our civic calendars and the way most people actually think about the seasons, Hammer adds. “We think of winter being the coldest time and summer being the warmest time, with spring and fall being transitions.”And for climate scientists, following meteorological winter offers important simplicity: “It just makes it easier in terms of calculating statistics and making comparisons from one season to another,” Hammer says. “The timing of the solstice can vary a bit. This way, we are comparing apples to apples when speaking seasonally, like noting that a certain winter was the coldest on record in a certain area.”Most of us see the year's earliest sunset a week or two before the solstice. That’s because the sun and our human clocks don't keep exactly the same time.A polar bear watches her cubs on the Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada. The bay is famous for polar bears, but their population is in decline.We've organized our days into 24-hour segments, but Earth doesn't spin on its axis that precisely. While the time from noon to noon is always exactly 24 hours, the time varies between solar noons, the moment each day when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. As we move through the year, the chronological time of solar noon shifts seasonally—and so do each day's sunrises and sunsets.During December, solar noons can happen some 30 seconds after we would mark a 24-hour cycle. While the shortest amount of total daylight falls on the solstice, that day's sunset is actually a few minutes later on our clocks than it was earlier in the month.Closer to the Equator, the year's earliest sunset occurs in November. To see it coincide more closely with the solstice, simply head toward the Arctic. Seasonal shifts in the sun's path across the sky are most extreme closer to the Poles, which makes sunset times at high latitudes match the solstice schedule more closely.It is possible to see the effects of the solstice by noting what happens in the skies overhead, as well as the changes in sunlight over time.For viewers in the north, the sun's arc across the sky has been steadily dropping lower and becoming shorter since June. At the northern winter solstice, it reaches its lowest possible arc—so low that in the few days surrounding the solstice, it appears to rise and set in the same place. That phenomenon produced the Latin origins of the word “solstice,” which means “sun stands still.”The sun's low angle means that your noontime shadow is the longest it will be for the entire year during the winter solstice.In the ancient world, people built a number of monuments to commemorate the solstice. One example is Newgrange, a huge Stone Age tomb mound built in the Irish countryside around 3200 B.C., about a thousand years before Stonehenge. A tunnel facing the solstice sunrise runs to a main chamber, where the dead may have once been placed. A small window bathes the chamber in solstice light for 17 minutesThe Paracas people of Peru, who lived around 800 to 100 B.C., crisscrossed the desert with lines of earth and rock called geoglyphs that connect ceremonial mounds with the place where the winter solstice sun sets on the horizon. The famed Nasca Lines—awe-inspiring monkeys, lizards, and other giant figures etched into the earth by a subsequent Peruvian culture around A.D. 1 to 700—also feature alignments with the winter solstice.Ancient Egypt's sprawling Temple of Karnak was constructed in alignment with the winter solstice at Luxor more than 4,000 years ago. Similar alignments can be seen at Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Machu Picchu in Peru.For more than two billion Christians, the solstice has long been overshadowed by Christmas. But to historian David Gwynn of the University of London, the proximity of the two events may not be an accident.According to Gwynn, one theory holds that Christmas was set on December 25 to replace a Roman holiday, which had roots in the pagan cult of Sol Invictus (“the unconquered sun”).Other solstice traditions color today's winter holiday celebrations. Scandinavians once celebrated Juul, or Yule, a multiday feast marking the sun god's return. In Britain, Druids observed the solstice by cutting mistletoe.Some ancient solstice celebrations continue in the present day. Iran's Yalda festival marks the day when Mithra, an angel of light, was thought to have been born. The tradition was adopted into Zoroastrianism and is still observed by staying up late and savoring treats like watermelon and pomegranate.China's Dōngzhì festival marks the time when winter's darkness begins to give way to light. Families observe this time by enjoying special foods, such as glutinous rice balls known as tang yuan.",
"Megaliths are the most visible remnants of a European past that otherwise seems unimaginably remote. These massive stone structures, dating back more than 6,000 years, have never failed to capture the imagination of those who encounter them—from the Neolithic farmers who first conceived them to modern archaeologists now shedding light on the origins and purposes of these formidable monuments.Every age interprets megaliths in its own way. In the Middle Ages they were seen as the work of Greek giants. The antiquarians of the 18th and 19th centuries assumed they had been erected by invading forces of Romans, Goths, or Huns.It was a British antiquarian, Algernon Herbert, who in 1849 used the term megalith for the first time, derived from the Greek words megas, large, and lithos, stone. In the 20th century, as archaeology and scientific techniques developed, it was possible to shed light on at least some of the mysteries surrounding these silent stone titans.Experts now believe that megaliths stood at the very heart of ritual practice for the networks of communities scattered across western Europe later in the new Stone Age, or Neolithic period, that had begun around 10,000 B.C. Their function was both earthly and celestial: a focus for rites concerning the movement of the heavenly bodies across the skies, a memorial to the community’s ancestors, and an awe-inspiring site to cement local loyalty and solidarity. (See also: When Is the First Day of Winter? December Solstice 2017 Explained.)European megaliths usually fall into three main categories. First came the solitary standing stone or menhir. The term “menhir” derives from words in Welsh and Breton used for stone (maen) and long (hir). Menhirs began to appear around 4500 B.C. in areas all over western Europe and ranged in height from three to 20 feet.The second type of megalithic structure is a grouping of several menhirs, which were arranged in lines (alignments) or in circles. Spread across several sites in northern France, the Carnac Stones are alignment menhirs with more than 3,000 stone monuments dating as far back as 3300 B.C. Stonehenge, perhaps the world’s most famous megalith, is a circular grouping. Located in Salisbury Plain, England, Stonehenge was built in several phases, beginning in 3000 B.C.The third category includes tombs, which appeared in France, Great Britain, Ireland, and the Iberian Peninsula around 4000 B.C. The most common was the dolmen, a simple structure consisting of upright stones supporting a flat slab of rock, creating a single chamber underneath.More complex tombs were also built, some of which included passages and multiple rooms. These spaces were often hidden inside a mound of earth, a cairn of stones, or a tumulus formed of both earth and stones. Sometimes several tombs of this type were grouped around a larger focal point to form megalithic cemeteries.Europe’s megaliths have one big thing in common: heavy rocks. How heavy were they? Just one of the many slabs of the Dolmen of Menga in Spain weighs 65 U.S. tons. A typical structure was built of standing stones, known as orthostats, with large slabs laid across the top. There are several theories on how they were put into place. One possibility is that builders first marked the outline of the monument on the ground. Next they dug a deep hole for each standing stone. Then they laid the orthostats on rollers (as seen in this French illustration from 1865, the year the term "Neolithic" was coined) and moved them to the hole’s edge. There, each could be eased upright as wooden levers pushed from behind and teams of men pulled from the front with ropes. The stones for the top were then hauled up a temporary earthen ramp.It was on Europe’s Atlantic coast that another distinctive structure appeared: the passage grave. This type of tomb consisted of a tumulus made of soil or stone, inside which a long narrow passageway led to a funerary chamber. New rites associated with these installations also emerged, and different communities appear to have developed similar approaches to the structures. From early on, the megaliths in the Atlantic region presented common elements, ranging from design, construction techniques, orientation, and the symbols carved into the stone’s surface.Archaeologist Glyn Daniel estimated that in Atlantic Europe—the British Isles, Galicia in northern Spain, Portugal, and Brittany in France—between 40,000 and 50,000 such chambers have been preserved, although originally there may have been double this number. These burial places would have occupied dominant positions in the landscape, along the coasts, on promontories or the crests of hills.The appearance of megalithic structures in Europe tracks with the development of agriculture. From the middle of the fifth millennium B.C. the emerging Neolithic communities of Europe began to radically transform their environment. They cut down swaths of forest to grow crops and graze their flocks. They left behind the old nomadic ways of the hunter-gatherer and settled where they were growing food. It was these first agrarian communities that created the impressive megalithic landscapes of Europe.Why did the establishment of agricultural activity coincide with the creation of megalithic monuments? Unlike the nomadic hunter­gatherer model of survival, agriculture entailed a permanent relationship with a specific location: the land cultivated for crops, the pasture land, and the settlement itself. Constructing a megalithic structure placed a powerful visible mark of a community’s ownership of, and relationship with, the portion of land that they worked. The act of constructing the vast monuments would have further reinforced the bonds among members of the community as well as legitimizing their claim to a particular place.An increasing number of people needed to cooperate with one another. It was vital to have enough laborers to till the fields, tend the flocks, and harvest the crops. This need for collaborative work brought about the formation of ever wider networks of people unconnected by blood ties. Within this framework, there arose a system of governance that further united the community by establishing sanctions and punishments to ensure the necessary cooperation from all members of the community.Megaliths also demonstrated how the economic aspect of agriculture could lead to the development of religion. Thanks to agriculture, communities could produce surplus food, which created a class of people who, freed from food-production duties, could dedicate themselves to leadership and protection of the community through ritual practices. So it was out of this context that the megalith was born: a combination of a closer cooperation, the need to consecrate links with the earth on which the community relied, and the emergence of group members dedicated to ritual practices.John Lubbock coined the term “Neolithic” in 1865. Meaning “new stone,” it alludes to the period in which stone was polished, giving it a more refined finish than in the Paleolithic era. The technique is clearly visible on these ax heads, dating from 4000 B.C. to 2200 B.C.Many megaliths have been identified as the focal point for funerary rituals, especially, of course, structures found to house human remains. The tombs—some of which have been found to contain the cremated or buried remains of up to 200 people—suggest a group effort was made to create a connection between the deceased and the land where they lived.It is also believed that these burials reflect a hierarchical society in which important members of the community were buried in tombs while lesser members were not. If so, power would have been seen as hereditary; blood links to ancestors would have provided certain members of the community with power over both the physical world as well as the world of the dead. The imposing presence of the passage graves would have reinforced still further the social differences between the strata of these early agrarian communities.It was no coincidence that many megalithic tombs were constructed in locations that are ideal for observing the solstices, equinoxes, or the cycles of the moon. The remarkable Newgrange passage grave in Ireland, built around 3200 B.C., is one of the most famous examples. Over the entrance there is a cavity, angled very precisely so that light reaches the chamber on the shortest day of the year in Europe: the winter solstice, in mid-December. Now, as then, as day dawns from December 19 through 21, light penetrates this aperture and illuminates the entire length of the passage for 15 to 20 minutes each morning.The incorporation of astronomical alignments suggests that Neolithic ceremonies were closely bound with the changing seasons. These cycles were critical to agrarian communities, whose leaders would benefit from this essential knowledge. It is also possible that the ability to accurately predict dramatic events such as solar eclipses would have significantly bolstered the power and prestige of those leaders.As megalithic tombs became more complex, they also grew more decorative, incorporating carved motifs and colors. Scholars such as Primitiva Bueno Ramírez suggest that a good number of these constructions in western Europe may have been decorated with pigments, especially red, black, and white. These three colors are present in the inherent makeup of the monuments: the red of the sandstone, the white of the granite or quartz, and the black of the darkness that reigns in the interior chambers.Researchers Aaron Watson and David Keating focus on a different sensory dimension. They examine various acoustic phenomena associated with the megalithic chambers and demonstrate that when a drum is beaten inside the structure, it produces a series of unusual sensations related to infrasounds—i.e., sound waves below the frequency of audible range. In nature these are generated by events such as volcanic eruptions, avalanches, or earthquakes. A study was carried out to test the effect of these sounds on the people listening. It was noted that the pulse and breathing patterns of participants in the study altered. This raises the possibility that a prolonged exposure to such sounds could have led to hyperventilation—fast breathing that causes a sense of excitement.Archaeological evidence shows that Europe’s Neolithic farmers grew a variety of crops, including wheat and barley. They developed tools such as this grindstone to turn grains into flour.The best way to understand the impact of these tombs is to try to get inside the mind of a Neolithic farmer. What would he or she have thought on encountering such a monumental structure?It must have been a powerful focal point on the landscape, visible even from a distance, especially given the prominent places where megaliths tended to be placed. As they drew nearer to the monument, its sheer size must have been overwhelming. The entrances to some tombs were also impressive, decorated with carved symbols, and vibrant painted colors. But the most awesome moment of all must surely have come on venturing inside the cool, dark space of the tomb, reaching the funerary chamber in the presence of the ancestors.British archaeologist Julian Thomas argues that a key factor in the design of megalithic structures was precisely to provoke a powerful emotional reaction. The architecture of the passage dictated a pattern of movements that affected all the senses simultaneously. The first steps took people into a dark internal chamber. Ducking their heads down, they then made their way slowly down the long, dark passage. With little natural light, they probably placed their hands on the walls for guidance, all the while sensing the curved forms of the carvings under their fingertips and the sounds of ritual vibrating through their body. At the tunnel’s end, they might have needed to crouch down even more to enter the funerary chamber itself. All the elements combined to give a dramatic, physical sense of entering the rarefied domain of the ancestors.The association of the megalithic monoliths with astronomical events, colors, and sounds suggests that they were more than burial places. It is likely that they were also ritual areas where preachers would have spoken, formulated astronomical predictions, and used distinctive symbols and evocative colors. It seems that the physical architecture of these monuments, when combined with these rituals, would help provoke specific physical and mental reactions and would add to the community members’ sense of awe, consolidating their loyalty to the societies to which they belonged, and preserving the memory of former leaders who had died.",
"Jupiter and its volcanic moon Io peer out in this 2007 portrait taken by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft. The final picture is a compilation of infrared images that highlights variations in the altitude of the giant planet’s stormy atmosphere.The fifth planet from the sun, Jupiter is what watercolor dreams are made of. Vibrant bands of clouds ripple around its thick atmosphere, making up a world so large that more than 1,300 Earths could fit inside. Its Great Red Spot seems to peer out from the swirling vapors like an enormous eye in the face of a striped giant.Though seemingly serene when viewed from the relative safety of our home world, Jupiter is a chaotic and stormy place. The gas giant planet's spots and swirls come from massive storms that whip up prevailing winds as fast as 335 miles an hour at the equator—faster than any known winds on Earth.That includes the Great Red Spot, which is a massive hurricane-like storm called an anticyclone. It's far bigger and longer lasting than any tempests that have ever raged across our planet's surface: It rotates in an ever-present oval that's more than the width of the entire Earth, although it has been shrinking for as long as humans have been observing it.Jupiter is a massive ball of gas. Its clouds are composed of ammonia and water vapor drifting in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The particular cloud chemistries are likely the magic behind the planet's vibrant colors, but the exact reasons for Jupiter's painted appearance remains unknown.Below the gassy upper layers, the pressure and temperature increase so much that atoms of hydrogen eventually compress into a liquid. Pressures climb so high that the hydrogen loses its electrons, and the soupy mess can host an electrical charge, just like metal.The planet's fast spin on its axis means that one Jupiter day lasts less than 10 Earth hours, and it sparks electrical currents that may drive the planet's intense and massive magnetic field, which is 16 to 54 times as powerful as Earth's.Jupiter is the second brightest planet in the night sky, after Venus, which allowed early astronomers to spot and study the massive planet hundreds of years ago. In January 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei spotted what he thought were four small stars tagging along with Jupiter. These pinpricks of light are actually Jupiter's four largest moons, now known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.Many of these celestial orbs are as remarkable as Jupiter itself. The largest moon in the solar system, Ganymede is also the only moon known to have its own magnetic field. Volcanoes rage on Io's surface, earning it the title of the solar system's most volcanically active body. And scientists believe Europa sports a deep, vast ocean beneath its icy crust, making it a top candidate in the hunt for alien life.But these are not the planet's only celestial tag-alongs. Jupiter has dozens more—and there may still be more to find. In 2003 alone, astronomers identified 23 new moons. And in June of 2018, researchers discovered 12 more Jovian moons that wander in oddball paths around the giant world.Since Galileo first laid telescope-enhanced eyes on Jupiter, scientists have continued to study the curious world from both the ground and the sky. In 1979, NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft zipped by the gas giant, taking tens of thousands of pictures as they passed by. Among the surprises from these missions, the data revealed that giant Jupiter sports thin, dusty rings.And when NASA's Juno spacecraft began orbiting Jupiter in 2016, it quickly started sending back breathtaking images. The stunning pictures revealed that the planet is even more wild than we once thought. Juno returned some of the first detailed looks at the planet's poles, which revealed cyclone swarms gyrating on its surface with roots that likely extend deep below the upper bands of clouds.Though Jupiter has been so intensely examined, many mysteries remain. One enduring question is what drives Jupiter's Great Red Spot, and what will happen to it in the future. Then there's the question of what actually lies at Jupiter's core. Magnetic field data from the Juno spacecraft suggest that the planet's core is surprisingly large and seems to be made of a partially dissolved solid material. Whatever that is, it's searing hot. Scientists estimate the temperature in this region could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit—hot enough to melt titanium.",
"The moon, Venus, Mars, and the star Spica appear in a quadruple conjunction as seen from Azul, Argentina.The first spacecraft to set mechanical feet on another planet landed on Venus. In the 1960s and '70s, the former Soviet Union's Venera probes plunged through the planet's punishing atmosphere, with a handful even sending back data from its rocky surface. In December 1970, for instance, the Venera 8 lander transmitted atmospheric data for more than 50 minutes after its turbulent touchdown. These early missions provided an important lesson: Venus is like a massive pressure cooker.Although the planet is the second closest planet to the sun, it's by far the hottest of the eight worlds in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, which traps the sun's heat and creates a runaway greenhouse effect.Thanks to this atmospheric blanket, temperatures on Venus' surface can soar over 880 degrees Fahrenheit—hot enough to melt lead. The surface pressure is around 90 times that on Earth, which would feel like standing under about a half a mile of water. Wintertime doesn't even provide a reprieve from the heat. With an axial tilt of three degrees, Venus has just one season: hot.The only planet named after a female figure, Venus is a celestial oddball. Though its rocks are shades of grey, its atmosphere imparts an eerie orange glow to the landscape. Together with Mercury, it's one of the few planets in our solar system without a moon. And like Uranus, it turns on its axis in the opposite direction to the rest of our celestial family. Due to this retrograde rotation, if you were to stand on Venus' surface, the sun would rise in the West and set in the East.But don't count on catching many Venusian sunsets; the planet turns stunningly slow. A single day there takes 243 Earth days—longer than a Venusian year, which lasts 225 Earth days. And because the planet rotates in the opposite direction as its orbit, 117 Earth days pass between each sunrise and sunset.Despite the strange and scorching conditions, Venus shares a surprising number of features with Earth. Measuring 7,520 miles across, Venus is roughly the same diameter as our home planet. It also has a similar structure, sporting a rocky surface and an iron core, although the planet doesn't rotate fast enough to generate an Earth-like magnetic field.Thousands of volcanoes dot Venus' surface, some of which may still be active. Volcanic rock from cooled lava covers most of its surface—the oldest of which dates back some 500 million years. Many mountains also rise into Venusian skies. Its largest, dubbed Maxwell Montes, stands 36,000 feet tall.The processes driving the formation of this network of formations is unusual, however. Venus doesn't appear to harbor a churning seismic engine like that on Earth, which drives our bumper-car network of tectonic plates. Yet the planet does appear to have a spidery network of breaks in its surface, hinting at an entirely new type of plate tectonics.Scientists suspect that for up to two billion years after it formed, the planet may have even been habitable—harboring liquid oceans on its surface. Fascination with what drove that transition from happy to hellish has led many scientists to campaign for more robotic visits to Venus.Venus' dense cloud cover has benefits for us Earthlings. It reflects the sun's rays, making the planet the brightest in the night sky. It's often called the morning star or evening star because its bright, steady glow persists either around sunrise or sunset. Ancient peoples spotted these dazzling points in the sky and believed them to be two different objects, one that glows in the morning and another that glows in the evening.Similar to Mercury, Venus can occasionally be seen making a lazy trip across the sun's face, known as a transit. But while Mercury zips across the sun every 13 to 14 years, Venus transits are much more rare. The planet's orbit is almost a perfect circle but is slightly tipped relative to Earth's path around our star. This means it's incredibly hard for the sun, Venus, and Earth to align in the right way.The last time a transit of Venus happened was in 2012, and it won't happen again until 2117.",
"Dark higher-altitude clouds obscure the brighter mid-altitude clouds in this image of Venus taken by an infrared camera on board Japan's Akatsuki Venus Climate Orbiter. Phospine gas detected in the temperate mid-altitude clouds is teasing scientists with a possible signature for life.Something deadly might be wafting through the clouds shrouding Venus—a smelly, flammable gas called phosphine that annihilates life-forms reliant on oxygen for survival. Ironically, though, the scientists who today announced sightings of this noxious gas in the Venusian atmosphere say it could be tantalizing—if controversial—evidence of life on the planet next door.As far as we know, on rocky planets such as Venus and Earth, phosphine can only be made by life—whether human or microbe. Used as a chemical weapon during World War I, phosphine is still manufactured as an agricultural fumigant, is used in the semiconductor industry, and is a nasty byproduct of meth labs. But phosphine is also made naturally by some species of anaerobic bacteria—organisms that live in the oxygen-starved environments of landfills, marshlands, and even animal guts.Earlier this year, researchers surmised that finding the chemical on other terrestrial planets could indicate the presence of alien metabolisms, and they suggested aiming the sharpest telescopes of the future at faraway exoplanets to probe their atmospheres for signs of the gas.Now, we may have found signs of phosphine on the planet next door, astronomers report in the journal Nature Astronomy.“I immediately freaked out, of course. I presumed it was a mistake, but I very much wanted it to not be a mistake,” says study co-author Clara Sousa-Silva, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who initially identified phosphine as a potential biosignature.Put simply, phosphine shouldn’t be in the Venusian atmosphere. It’s extremely hard to make, and the chemistry in the clouds should destroy the molecule before it can accumulate to the observed amounts. But it’s too early to conclude that life exists beyond Earth’s shores. Scientists caution that the detection itself needs to be verified, as the phosphine fingerprint described in the study could be a false signal introduced by the telescopes or by data processing.“It’s tremendously exciting, and we have a sort of obligatory response of first questioning whether the result is real,” says David Grinspoon of the Planetary Science Institute. “When somebody comes up with an extraordinary observation that hasn’t been made before, you wonder if they could have done something wrong.”But if phosphine really is floating through the Venusian cloud deck, its presence suggests one of two intriguing possibilities: that alien life-forms are deftly linking together phosphorus and hydrogen atoms, or that some completely unanticipated chemistry is crafting phosphine in the absence of life.Venus, the second world from the sun, has long been considered Earth’s twin. It’s about the same size as our home planet, with similar gravity and composition. For centuries, hopeful humans thought its surface might be covered in oceans, lush vegetation, and verdant ecosystems, providing a second oasis for life in the solar system.Then reality intruded.Early science observations of the planet next door revealed that it is a menace of a world that could kill Earthlings in multiple ways. Its surface can reach a sweltering 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Tucked beneath as many as 65 miles of cloud and haze, those roasted rocks are smothered by a bone-crushing amount of pressure, more than 90 times what’s felt on Earth’s surface. Plus, the planet’s atmosphere is primarily suffocating carbon dioxide populated by sulfuric acid clouds.Even so, scientists have considered the possibility that life might exist in the Venusian cloud deck for nearly 60 years, perhaps thriving where conditions are a bit friendlier.“While the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the clouds of Venus are a different story altogether,” Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz wrote in the journal Nature back in 1967.Despite the acid, the clouds carry the basic ingredients for life as we know it: sunlight, water, and organic molecules. And near the middle of the cloud layer, temperatures and pressures are rather Earthlike. “It’s shirt-sleeve weather, with all these tasty things to eat,” says Martha Gilmore, a Wesleyan University planetary scientist and leader of a proposed mission to Venus, referring to molecules in the planet’s air that microbes could metabolize.Early observations of the planet revealed that parts of its atmosphere absorb more ultraviolet light than expected, an anomaly that scientists hypothesized could be the work of aerial microbes. While the phenomenon is more likely due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds, a handful of scientists have since elaborated on the possibility of airborne Venusians, laying out scenarios in which microbes might metabolize sulfur compounds, stay afloat among the ever-present clouds, and even develop life cycles enabled by periods of dormancy at varying altitudes.“When I first started talking about it, there was a lot of resistance, mostly because it’s such a harshly acidic environment,” says Grinspoon, who has pushed the idea of cloud-borne life on Venus since the mid-1990s.But everything we’ve learned about life on Earth suggests that it will move into every available nook and cranny. Here, we find microbes thriving in hostile, corrosive environments such as hot springs and volcanic fields. We also know that microbes regularly hitch a ride on cloud particles, and scientists have found organisms flying more than six miles above the Caribbean. Clouds are ephemeral on Earth, so it’s unlikely that they support permanent ecosystems, but on Venus, cloudy days are in the forecast for millions or even billions of years.“On Venus, that puddle never dries up,” Grinspoon says. “The clouds are continuous and thick and globe-spanning.”Although Venus is a roasting world today, observations suggest that it once had a liquid water ocean. For most of its history, Venus could have been as habitable as Earth—until sometime in the last billion years, when ballooning greenhouse gases transformed the planet from an oasis into a death trap. Perhaps, as the scorched surface became less hospitable, life-forms migrated into the clouds to avoid certain extinction.Any life there now is “much more likely to be a relic of a more dominating early biosphere,” says Penelope Boston, a NASA astrobiologist who specializes in studying microbes in weird places on Earth. She’s skeptical, though. “I think it’s a blasted hellhole now, so how much of that ancient signal could have held up?”In June 2017, Cardiff University’s Jane Greaves and colleagues took a look at Venus using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, which scans the sky in radio wavelengths from its perch atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. They were looking for rare gases or molecules that might be biological in origin. Among the signatures they spotted was that of phosphine gas, a pyramidal molecule comprising three hydrogen atoms joined to a single phosphorus atom.Not long after, Greaves got in touch with Sousa-Silva, who spent her years in graduate school working out whether phosphine could be a viable extraterrestrial biosignature. She had concluded that phosphine could be one of life’s beacons, even though paradoxically, it’s lethal to everything on Earth that requires oxygen to survive.“I was really fascinated by the macabre nature of phosphine on Earth,” she says. “It’s a killing machine ... and almost a romantic biosignature because it was a sign of death.”In 2019, Greaves, Sousa-Silva, and their colleagues followed up on the initial phosphine observation using ALMA, an array of telescopes on a high Chilean plateau. More sensitive than the Hawaii-based telescope, ALMA also observes the sky at radio frequencies, and it can detect the energy emitted and absorbed by any phosphine molecules spinning in the Venusian atmosphere.Again, the team detected phosphine. This time, scientists could narrow down the molecule’s signal to equatorial latitudes and an altitude between 32 and 37 miles, where temperatures and pressures aren’t too harsh for life as we know it. Based on the signal’s strength, the team calculated that phosphine’s abundance is roughly 20 parts per billion, or at least a thousand times more than we find on Earth.In the outer solar system, phosphine is made deep in the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. Near the giant planets’ cores, the temperatures and pressures are extreme enough to craft the molecule, which then rises through the atmosphere. But on rocky planets, where conditions are significantly less extreme, there’s no known way to make phosphine in the absence of life—it’s just too energetically demanding. In other words, if the observation of phosphine on Venus is right, something must be continually replenishing the molecule in the planet’s atmosphere.“Life is the only thing that will put energy into making molecules,” Sousa-Silva says. “Otherwise, in the universe, chemistry only happens when it’s energetically favorable.”Astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch of Technical University Berlin, who has considered cloud-based Venusian life, agrees a biological explanation for the phosphine is possible, but he thinks other unknown geologic or light-induced chemical reactions might yet account for the signal. “Venus is basically still an alien planet,” he says. “There are a lot of things we don’t understand.”The study team set out to determine whether phosphine could be made on Venus in the absence of biology. Among the scenarios the scientists investigated were volcanic outgassing, intense lightning strikes, tectonic plates rubbing together, bismuth rain, and cosmic dust. Based on the team’s calculations, none of those events could produce the molecule in such abundance.“Whether it’s life or not, it has to be a really exotic mechanism,” Sousa-Silva says. “Something weird is happening.”Still, ALMA observatory scientist John Carpenter is skeptical that the phosphine observations themselves are real. The signal is faint, and the team needed to perform an extensive amount of processing to pull it from the data returned by the telescopes. That processing, he says, may have returned an artificial signal at the same frequency as phosphine. He also notes that the standard for remote molecular identification involves detecting multiple fingerprints for the same molecule, which show up at different frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum. That’s something that the team has not yet done with phosphine.“They took the right steps to verify the signal, but I’m still not convinced that this is real,” Carpenter says. “If it’s real, it’s a very cool result, but it needs follow-up to make it really convincing.”Sousa-Silva agrees that the team needs to confirm the phosphine detection by finding additional fingerprints at other wavelengths. She and her colleagues had planned such observations using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, a plane-mounted telescope, and with NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. But COVID-19 got in the way, and the team’s attempts have been put on hold.“It’s disappointing that we don’t have this proof,” Sousa-Silva says.Even so, Sanjay Limaye, a planetary scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says the discovery is exciting enough to continue searching, and preferably from a much closer vantage point. “It is intriguing that it may point to something strange going on in the atmosphere of Venus, but is it exotic chemistry, or is it life?” he says. “We need to go explore and find out.”The tentative detection of phosphine is likely to fuel calls for a return to Venus—a trip that some say is long overdue, given that the last time NASA sent a probe to the planet was in 1989. Schulze-Makuch says it’s completely within the realm of possibility to do an atmospheric sample-return mission, sending a spacecraft to swoop through the clouds and gather gas and particles to bring back to Earth.Several proposed missions are moving through review, including an elaborate, multi-spacecraft concept led by Gilmore of Wesleyan University, which will be evaluated by the planetary science community as it sets its priorities for the next decade of solar system exploration. Gilmore’s concept includes several orbiters and a balloon that would closely study the Venusian atmosphere and look for signs of life.On the more immediate horizon, a smaller mission to study the deep atmosphere of Venus, named DAVINCI+, is one of the four finalists in NASA’s Discovery program competition. The next mission selection is scheduled to take place in 2021.“Venus is such a complex, amazing system, and we don’t understand it. And it’s another Earth. It probably had an ocean for billions of years, and it’s right there. It’s just a matter of going,” Gilmore says. “We have the technology right now to go into the atmosphere of Venus. It can be done.”",
"Europa is like a spherical ice cube that has partially melted. In fact, if you shook this small moon of Jupiter, you might hear a sloshing sound.That’s because a deep, global ocean lies beneath the moon’s frozen, criss-crossed crust – an ocean that might be as much as 100 kilometers deep. In fact, Europa’s ocean is so vast that it contains between two and three times as much water as all the oceans on Earth, combined.What swims in that alien sea? We don’t yet know. Maybe nothing. But astrobiologists have placed Europa at – or near – the top of their visitation wish-list for decades. That massive ocean, which is likely filled with minerals from the alien ocean floor, plus the possibility of hydrothermal sea vents, makes this small moon one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth in the solar system.Piercing that icy crust and sinking a spacecraft into the ocean is no trivial matter, though. But not to worry: Scientists are working on solving that problem. And maybe in the next decade or so, Earth will send a spacecraft to this faraway moon, a probe tasked with sniffing around and possibly scouting out landing sites for future spacecraft.It wouldn’t be the first time a robotic emissary had the moon in sight, though. In the 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft zipped through the Jovian system and studied the solar system’s most massive world. Part of that campaign included taking pictures of the many moons in Jupiter’s gravitational clutches.If you thought you’d seen all the images Galileo had to offer, you’d be wrong. NASA released a new view of Europa today. It’s a reprocessed version of images taken on November 6, 1997, and spans an area that’s roughly 160 square kilometers. Those red streaks that look like highways are formed by sulfur-containing compounds oozing through the ice. And if the streaks are anything like what we see on Earth – up in the Canadian Arctic – then maybe they’re the mark of life beneath the surface.",
"The solar system's largest moon, Ganymede, seems to float alongside Jupiter in a picture taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Astronomers on Earth have now found a dozen more moons orbiting the gas giant, bringing its total to 79.In a curveball of cosmic proportions, astronomers went looking for a hypothetical planet on the far fringes of our solar system, and instead found 12 new moons dancing around Jupiter.To be clear, these moons are no Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. They’re tiny, some barely a mile across, and they are tracing all kinds of weird paths around the giant world.Dynamic bands of clouds shine in this mosaic of images from the Cassini orbiter, the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter ever produced.The team found the new moons almost by accident, thanks to a serendipitous alignment of Jupiter with their initial research project and some recently installed telescope technology.“Fascinating,” says planetary scientist Doug Hemingway of the University of California, Berkeley. “This is a great reminder that when you build up the capability to study one thing, you never know what else you might discover along the way.”Normally, spotting new moons around Jupiter is quite difficult. Anything small enough to still be hiding from our view is quite faint, and tracking those dim dots requires powerful telescopes that often have too small a field of view to capture the entire Jovian system. To make matters worse, Jupiter is quite bright, and its glare can obscure tiny moons.But last year, the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Scott Sheppard and his colleagues were hunting a faraway planet rumored to orbit beyond Pluto—a planet so large its gravitational heft rearranges the orbits of smaller, distant objects. So, the team aimed a telescope at Chile’s Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory at the star fields surrounding our cosmic neighborhood, looking for faraway pinpricks of light moving in solar orbits.Along the way, Sheppard and his colleagues realized that Jupiter was in the telescope’s crosshairs—and they decided to take advantage of the opportunity.“We’re using a new camera that was only put on the telescope a few years ago,” Sheppard says. “It can search large areas much quicker, so we only had to use four images to cover the whole area around Jupiter.”The first hints of 10 new moons appeared in March 2017 (two had been spotted earlier), and the signals were seen again the next month. But confirming orbits takes a while, and it wasn’t until the team re-observed Jupiter in May that all the moons were confirmed, bringing the planet’s total to 79.“These small outer moons are by far the most numerous type of moon in the Jovian system,” says Bonnie Buratti of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “It may seem like an ordinary discovery to add these small moons to an already large collection. Not by any means.”The dozen new moons range in size from roughly one to three miles across. Two of the moons are clustered relatively near the planet, and they orbit in the same direction that Jupiter spins. They’re likely the remnants of a much larger moon that has been broken into pieces over the billions of years since the birth of the solar system.An illustration shows the orbits of the outer moons of Jupiter.But nine of the moons, grouped into three more distant clusters, move backward, orbiting in a fashion known as retrograde. Like the inner cluster, these are likely clumps of moony debris left over from collisions that destroyed much larger parent moons that were each perhaps several hundred miles across.“What did they collide with? Some comet? A rogue asteroid? Other moons in the Jupiter system?” Sheppard asks.In another fun twist, those parent bodies are unlikely to be native to the Jovian system, and instead were captured by the giant planet’s gravity in the very early days of the solar system.That might sound odd, but it’s not unusual for large planets to have snared smaller bodies over time, particularly during an early epoch when the giant planets migrated and perturbed the orbits of much less massive worlds.One of Saturn’s best-known satellites, Phoebe, was captured from the icy debris field known as the Kuiper belt, which lives beyond the orbit of Neptune. And perhaps not coincidentally, Neptune’s most famous moon Triton is also a captured Kuiper belt object.Images from the Magellan telescopes in Chile show the weird new moon Valetudo moving against the steady field of background stars.“Dynamicists believe the orbits of these outer moons, at least the ones that were captured early, were disrupted by the migration of the gas giants,” Buratti says.And then there’s the tiny weirdo Valetudo, the only one of the dozen to have earned a publicly proposed name. Following astronomy naming conventions, the suggested moniker for this moon comes from mythology—the Roman goddess of health and hygiene.Like the inner two moonlets, Valetudo orbits in the same direction as Jupiter’s spin. But its orbit is tilted relative to the planet, and it moves out near the three retrograde clusters. Because of that, Sheppard suspects that collisions with Valetudo are the culprits behind those busted up clusters, and that the strange moonlet is all that remains of a much larger moon.“It’s like if you’re driving down the highway the wrong way,” he says. “Collisions are very likely to happen.”Sheppard took a look at the other giant planets, too, and didn’t find any new moons orbiting Uranus and Neptune. That kind of bummed him out.“Uranus is the best one to find moons around,” he says, “because you get to name things after Shakespearean characters.”",
"The dust speck had been plucked from the tail of a comet more than 200 million miles away. Now, under an electron microscope in a basement lab at the University of Washington, its image grew larger, until it filled the computer screen like an alien landscape. Zooming in on a dark patch that looked like a jagged cliff, Dave Joswiak upped the magnification to 900,000. The patch resolved into tiny, jet-black grains. “Some of these guys are only a couple of nanometers in size—that’s amazingly small,” Joswiak said. His tone was reverent. “We think this is the primordial, unaltered material that everything formed from in the solar system.”The dust speck has a name: Inti, for the Inca god of the sun. It probably spent nearly all of the past 4.5 billion years in a deep freeze beyond Neptune, inside the comet Wild 2 (pronounced VILT-two). Decades ago Wild 2 somehow got nudged into an orbit that drew it in past Jupiter, where it began to disintegrate in the sun’s heat. In January 2004 a NASA spacecraft called Stardust zipped past Wild 2 and snared thousands of dust specks with a trap made of aerogel—a puffy, glassy material that looks like frozen smoke. Two years later a capsule carrying this delicate cargo parachuted into the Utah desert. The Stardust team teased the specks from the gel, stuck them in their electron microscopes, and stared back at the birth of our solar system. They were stunned by what they saw.Scientists have long known that the planets, comets, and other bodies orbiting the sun were born, some 4.5 billion years ago, from a spinning disk of dust and gas called the solar nebula. They’ve long assumed that things formed more or less where they orbit now. In the frigid realm beyond Neptune, the material available for making comets would have been a mix of ice and fluffy, carbon-rich dust. But Inti’s dark grains contained exotic minerals—hardy bits of rock and metal such as tungsten and titanium nitride that could only have been forged near the newborn sun, at temperatures of more than 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. Some violent process must have hurled them into the outer solar system.“We were dumbfounded,” says Donald Brownlee, head of the Stardust team and Joswiak’s boss. “It was astounding to find these highest-temperature materials in the solar system’s coldest bodies. The solar system was literally turning itself inside out.”When most of us were growing up, the solar system seemed reliable and well behaved. “There were nine planets orbiting in well-determined orbits like clockwork, forever,” says Renu Malhotra of the University of Arizona. “Forever in the past, and forever in the future.” Planetarium displays and the lovely mechanical devices called orreries embodied this idea, which went back to Isaac Newton. In the late 17th century Newton showed that a planet’s orbit could be calculated from its gravitational interaction with the sun. Soon clockmakers were building increasingly elaborate orreries, with brass planets that circled the sun on unchanging pathways.Newton himself knew that reality was messier. The planets, he recognized, must also interact with one another. Their gravitational tuggings are far weaker than those of the sun, but over time they affect the paths of neighbors. As a result, as Brownlee puts it, “there’s no such thing as a circular orbit.” In principle the relentless pull of gravity can amplify these small deviations until orbits migrate, cross, or otherwise go haywire. Newton concluded that God must step in from time to time to fix the clockwork. But he couldn’t say when. Even he who invented calculus was defeated by the “n-body problem”: He had no formula for calculating into the distant future the orbits of multiple bodies that were all pulling on one another.In practice no one saw evidence that planetary orbits had ever changed. So the clockwork solar system stuck with us—enduringly stable, it seemed, even without fixes from the Creator.But a far more dramatic view has arisen in the past decade or so. While the findings from Stardust indicate the solar system was turned inside out during infancy, many scientists now think it also went through a raucous adolescence: Hundreds of millions of years after they formed, the biggest planets swept into new orbits, casting large rocks and comets every which way. In this view the scarred surface of the moon is lingering testimony to a period of epic mayhem.“Who would have thought the giant planets might move, that the entire layout of the solar system could change?” says Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Some signs were there, Stern says. But it took new telescope surveys to reveal them, along with “digital orreries”—clever algorithms that apply brute computing power to calculating the past and future orbits of the planets.The first clue came from Pluto. The oddball of the solar system, it dips far above and below the pancake-like plane in which the eight planets travel; it swoops on an elongated orbit that takes it from 30 to 50 times Earth’s distance from the sun. But the most curious thing about Pluto is its bond with Neptune. It’s called a resonance: For every three times that Neptune orbits the sun, Pluto orbits twice, and in such a way that the bodies never approach each other.In 1993 Renu Malhotra figured out how that exact synchrony could have evolved. She proposed that when the solar system was young and full of asteroids and comets, Neptune was closer to the sun. If one of those bodies approached Neptune, the planet’s powerful gravity might either fling the object closer to the sun or out of the solar system entirely, in a cosmic version of crack the whip. Because action begets reaction, Neptune’s orbit would shift a tiny bit too. A human, even a Newton, could never calculate the effect of trillions of such interactions—but Malhotra’s computer model showed that on average they would compel Neptune to migrate away from the sun. In her scenario, that led it to “capture” Pluto, which was already farther out, and sweep it into gravitational lockstep.Her colleagues were doubtful, but Malhotra was proved right within a decade. In the Kuiper belt, a dark region extending far beyond Neptune, telescopes unveiled bunches of Plutinos—icy dwarf worlds that have the same two-to-three resonance with Neptune. That could only have happened, says Malhotra, if Neptune had advanced toward the Kuiper belt like a gravitational snowplow, piling up dwarf planets into new orbits. “Once the Plutinos were discovered, it was a slam dunk,” she says. “Planet migration practically became a textbook idea.”The notion of migrating planets came along at a time when planetary scientists were puzzled by several other features of the solar system. By the early 2000s they had long since realized that the birth pangs of the solar system had been violent. The planets had not condensed gently from the solar nebula; instead they had grown to full size by absorbing planetesimals—rocky asteroids, icy comets, and larger objects—that smashed into them at high speed. According to one theory, the moon coalesced from the spray of molten rock that was blasted into orbit when a body the size of Mars collided with Earth. All this probably happened in the first 100 million years.The puzzle was that the extreme violence didn’t end then. Many hundreds of millions of years later, the moon suffered a series of major impacts that left it permanently scarred with huge craters. This so-called Late Heavy Bombardment would have pounded Earth even more viciously. Scientists had no good explanation for what sparked it, since by the time it happened, the planets had swept their orbits mostly clean of debris.Telescopes were unveiling a similar enigma in the Kuiper belt. Besides Plutinos, it was littered with bodies on wildly different orbits. Some of the bodies were grouped in a flat disk, some in a puffy doughnut-shaped cloud; others were on orbits even more crazily eccentric (the technical term for elongated) than Pluto’s. “It looked like a train wreck,” says Harold Levison, Stern’s colleague at the Southwest Research Institute. The smooth outward migration of Neptune that Malhotra had used to explain the Plutinos would not have strewn debris so widely.Meanwhile, astronomers had started to discover planets around other stars—and to radically expand their notions of what’s possible in a planetary system. Hundreds of extrasolar planets have now been detected. Some are in tightly bunched orbits, much closer together than the planets in our solar system. Some are Jupiter- or Neptune-size worlds that race on insanely hot orbits close to their suns. Others loop deep into space on weird trajectories—on average the orbits of extrasolar planets are more eccentric than those in our solar system. Some planets even float freely in interstellar space.None of this is what you would expect from planets that were born in a spinning disk around a star and stayed quietly in their birthplace. That process should produce well-spaced, near-circular orbits, like the ones in the brass orreries. Clearly many planets had migrated, but smooth migrations didn’t seem to account for extreme orbits and late bombardments, at least not to Levison. He began to suspect that our solar system’s history had been anything but smooth—that it had somehow endured a “global gravitational instability,” as he now calls it. In 2004 he gathered with three colleagues on sabbatical in Nice, France, to try to work out how.Levison, who goes by “Hal,” is a burly man with thin, graying hair pulled back into a ponytail and an untamed Santa-style beard. He’s both serious and impish; his Boulder office contains lush old illustrations of planetary orbits, an Albert Einstein action figure, and a model of Gort, the robot from The Day the Earth Stood Still.He’s fond of giving provocative talks and will sometimes wear a catcher’s mask to ward off brickbats from the audience. “What I’m going to say is really absolutely crazy,” he said at the start of a recent seminar. “If we publish this, my career might be over.” He could have made the same remark back in 2004 about what is now called the Nice model—the hypothesis that he and his colleagues, including Alessandro Morbidelli of the Côte d’Azur Observatory in Nice, developed on the basis of dozens of computer simulations.In essence Levison’s team proposed that our solar system’s four giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—had started out much more closely packed together, on nearly circular orbits, with the latter three closer to the sun than they are now. Early on they were embedded in the disk-shaped solar nebula, which was still full of icy and rocky debris. As the planets absorbed those planetesimals or flung them away after close encounters, they cleared gaps in the disk.Because the planets were also tugging on one another, the whole system was fragile—“almost infinitely chaotic,” Levison says. Instead of each planet being linked only to the sun by a brass arm, it’s as if they were all linked by gravitational springs as well. The most powerful one linked the two biggest bodies, Jupiter and Saturn. A yank on that spring would jolt the whole system.And that, the team believes, is what happened when the solar system was about 500 million to 700 million years old. As the planets interacted with planetesimals, their own orbits shifted. Jupiter moved slightly inward; Saturn moved slightly outward, as did Uranus and Neptune. Everything happened slowly—until at a certain point Saturn was completing exactly one orbit for every two of Jupiter’s.That one-to-two resonance wasn’t stable like the one between Neptune and Pluto; it was a brief, vigorous yank on the spring. As Jupiter and Saturn approached and pulled each other repeatedly at the same point in their orbits, those near-circular orbits were stretched into the ellipses we see today. That soon ended the precise resonance, but not before Saturn had moved close enough to Uranus and Neptune to accelerate them. Those two planets hurtled violently outward. In about half the Nice team’s simulations, they even swapped places.As Uranus and Neptune plowed through zones of the solar system that were still full of icy planetesimals, they triggered a devastating cascade. Ice balls were catapulted in all directions. The giant planets captured a few as oddly orbiting moons. Many objects, perhaps including the comet Wild 2, were scattered into the Kuiper belt. An untold number—perhaps a trillion—were banished even farther to the Oort cloud, a vast cocoon of comets reaching halfway to the next star. A lot of comets were also hurled into the inner solar system, where they crashed into planets or fell apart in the heat of the sun.Meanwhile the giant-planet migrations also disrupted the rocky asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. Scattering asteroids joined comets from farther out to create the Late Heavy Bombardment. A recent NASA mission called GRAIL documented how badly our moon suffered then and earlier in its history: Its entire crust was deeply fractured. Earth would have caught even more flak, but shifting tectonic plates have erased the craters. Any early life could only have survived deep underground.The worst of the Late Heavy Bombardment was over, according to the Nice model, in less than 100 million years. But recent work by Bill Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute suggests that ongoing impacts may have disrupted life for up to two billion more years. When an asteroid slams into Earth, tiny droplets of molten rock are lofted high into the atmosphere, and they later rain out as solid, glassy beads called spherules. Deposits of spherules from the six-mile-wide asteroid that hit the Yucatán some 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs, have been discovered all over the world. So far at least a dozen comparable spherule beds have been found that date from a series of impacts between 1.8 billion and 3.7 billion years ago.The computer simulations by Bottke’s team trace the source of those impacts to a now vanished inner rim of the asteroid belt, which shed asteroids for two billion years after Jupiter disturbed it. According to Bottke, as many as 70 may have struck Earth, each comparable to the one that extinguished the dinosaurs.“Solar system evolution is dynamic,” Levison says. “It’s violent. Our solar system is probably on the mild side compared with what happens elsewhere. You probably need that mildness in order to have a habitable planet.”The Nice model is a hypothesis, and not all scientists are convinced it’s true. Everyone now agrees that at least some planets migrated, but whether that set off a violent solar-system-wide paroxysm is up for debate. “It’s a fascinating concept,” says Donald Brownlee. “It must happen in places, around other stars. Whether or not it happened here, we don’t know for sure.” It’s clear that comet particles like Inti were blasted outward from near the sun, he says, but the planets may have shifted more gently.The key to testing the Nice model is mapmaking. Charting the composition and orbits of distant objects should reveal whether and how the planets cast them there. Stern is leading a NASA mission called New Horizons that will send an unmanned probe past Pluto and its five known moons in July 2015. From there Stern hopes to redirect New Horizons to examine at least one other body in the Kuiper belt.Powerful new telescopes planned for the next decade will expose far more objects in the Kuiper belt. They may also peek into the Oort cloud, which Stern calls the solar system’s attic. The debris cast there by Jupiter may include some lost planets. “I think the Oort cloud will blow our minds,” says Stern. “It will be littered with planets. I think we’ll find lots of Marses and Earths out there.”What about the future of the planets we know? Forecasting the solar system is like forecasting the weather. There’s so much randomness in the system, says theorist Greg Laughlin of the University of California, Santa Cruz, that the forecast—as well as any historical reconstruction—has to be given in probabilities. Scientists are as certain as they can be that the four giant planets have finished wandering and will still be on the same orbits five billion years from now, when the aging sun is expected to balloon outward and engulf the inner planets. It’s a little bit less certain that the inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—will still be around to die that way.“There is a one percent chance the inner solar system will go dramatically unstable during the next five billion years,” says Laughlin. The problem is a weird long-distance connection between Jupiter and Mercury. When Jupiter’s closest approach to the sun lines up with Mercury’s noticeably squashed orbit in just the right way, Jupiter exerts a slight but steady tug. Over billions of years this gives Mercury a 1-in-100 chance of crossing the orbit of Venus. There is a further 1-in-500 chance that if Mercury goes nuts, it will also perturb the orbit of Venus or Mars enough for one of them to hit Earth—or miss it by several thousand miles, which would be almost as bad. “The entire Earth would get stretched and melted like taffy,” says Laughlin, eagerly demonstrating with his hands.That faint risk of apocalypse—a 1-in-50,000 chance that the Earth will succumb to orbital chaos before the sun incinerates it—is our legacy of the solar system’s youth, when it turned inside out. “If you give gravity enough time,” says Levison, “it will do stuff like this.”",
"Saturn is the jewel of the solar system. The giant, pastel-colored planet is surrounded by huge, iconic rings – and dozens of sparkling, icy moons.Ten years ago today, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft gently pulled into orbit around the ringed planet. The journey to Saturn took an arduous seven years and covered 3.5 billion kilometers. But the trek was essentially a warm-up for what would become a tireless, gymnastic exploration of the Saturnian system. (I’m in Washington, D.C. today for a National Geographic live eventa National Geographic live eventa National Geographic live event commemorating Cassini’s accomplishments.)For the last decade, Cassini has been continually looping through the system, flying high above the planet, swooping low over its satellites, and swiveling to stare at the next enigmatic target. It even dropped the European Space Agency’s Huygens lander onto the surface of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. The spacecraft has collected hundreds of gigabytes of data and snapped thousands of photos (a few of my favorites are in the gallery above), and beamed all of its observations back to eager scientists on Earth. Some of Cassini’s photos have even included Earth itself – visible as a pale blue smudge tucked into the spaces between the planet’s frigid rings.As Cassini swung through the picturesque planetscape, dynamic — sometimes violent — stories began to emerge.Cassini saw that the planet’s rings, made of small, icy particles, are constantly shifting. Ghostly spokes and braided patterns swim through parts of the disk. One of these patterns, spied in Saturn’s C-ring, is the twisted fingerprint of a comet that smashed into the rings around the time the Black Death was running around Europe (scientists figured this out by mathematically unwinding the twisty pattern – kind of the equivalent of a planetary ring rewind).The rings hide more than relics of ancient impacts. Surfing through the particulate sea are tiny moonlets, perhaps hundreds of them, that are invisible except for the propeller-shaped wakes they create. Small shepherd moons, like potato-shaped Prometheus and Pandora, prune the rings, sometimes creating gaps. And there are strange, 2.5-kilometer tall features that cast shadows over the super-flat disk, which average about 30 meters thick.And then there’s Saturn itself. When Cassini arrived in 2004, the planet’s northern hemisphere was emerging from the throes of winter, its pole a deep, otherworldly blue. Now, one-third of a Saturn year later, summer is arriving in the north. There, the planet’s jetstream churns away and imprints a curious hexagonal shape around the planet’s crown. Simultaneously, the planet’s poles have been lit by beautiful, strange auroras – the likes of which aren’t seen anywhere else in the solar system. Under Cassini’s watchful eye, the clouds crossing Saturn’s enormous face have morphed and swirled. In late 2010, an enormous storm began brewing; it started as a great white spot and eventually wrapped itself around the entire planet (complete with a massive amount of lightning).But if the planet is remarkable, its moons, arguably, are more so. Many of these tiny worlds are so different from one another, and so bizarre, that scientists puzzle over how they could have formed — how did bright white, pockmarked Tethys grow from the same building blocks that produced hazy, orange, oily Titan? It’s the same kind of question astronomers ask when they consider how such different planets emerged from the same disk of material swirling around an infant sun…just on a smaller scale.Some of the moons likely formed during giant, cataclysmic collisions early in the planet’s history. Others, like dark, far-flung Phoebe, are probably interlopers – objects from the outer-outer solar system that scientists suspect have been captured by Saturn’s gravity. Some moons offer few clues and many questions – like Iapetus, with its two-toned coloration, enormous landslides, and strange, equatorial mountain range. Rhea might have once had a ring (or not), Dione a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (and a massive series of canyons gouged through one hemisphere). Mimas, with its huge, carved out crater, improbably looks like the Death Star.And, the biggest mystery of all: Some of the moons might not be dead, lifeless worlds, but places where alien microbes could be stirring and slicing up molecules to produce energy.Now, thanks to data from Cassini, we know that two of Saturn’s moons are among the best places to look for extraterrestrial life in the solar system.Tiny Enceladus spews warm, salty water from giant fractures in its southern hemisphere; Cassini observations suggest that all the ingredients needed to build life are right there, tucked beneath the moon’s icy shell and wafting into outer space. Enormous Titan, the largest of the moony contingent, clings to a dense atmosphere that might be older than Saturn itself, and has a surface very similar Earth’s – except that where there’s water on Earth, there are liquid hydrocarbons on Titan. If scientists find life on Titan’s windswept surface, it will be in a form that’s vastly different from what we know on Earth. It will be unmistakably alien.These chapters of Cassini’s adventures in the Saturnian system have been an incredible odyssey to follow. And the good news is, the book isn’t completely written. If all goes well, Cassini could continue to twirl around the system for another three years. Then, when its fuel supply runs out in 2017, the spacecraft will plunge toward Saturn’s surface, desperately beaming data back to Earth until it crumples beneath the weight of the planet’s atmosphere.",
"Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. In 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to gaze at Saturn through a telescope. To his surprise, he saw a pair of objects on either side of the planet. He sketched them as separate spheres and wrote that Saturn appeared to be triple-bodied. In 1659, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, using a more powerful telescope than Galileo's, proposed that Saturn was surrounded by a thin, flat ring.In 1675, Italian-born astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini discovered a "division" between what are now called the A and B rings. It is now known that the gravitational influence of Saturn's moon Mimas is responsible for the Cassini Division, which is 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) wide.In this photograph taken in the Cassini spacecraft's 12th year orbiting Saturn, the ring shadows appear to obscure almost the entire southern hemisphere, while the planet's north pole and its six-sided jet stream, known as "the hexagon," are fully illuminated by the sun.Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet (500 meters) per second in the equatorial region. (In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet, or 110 meters, per second.) These superfast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.Saturn's ring system is the most extensive and complex in the solar system, extending hundreds of thousands of kilometers from the planet. In the early 1980s, NASA's two Voyager spacecraft revealed that Saturn's rings are made mostly of water ice. They also found "braided" rings, ringlets, and "spokes," dark features in the rings that circle the planet at different rates from that of the surrounding ring material. Material in the rings ranges in size from a few micrometers to several tens of meters, and the size and structure of the rings are partly a product of the gravitational influenceof several of Saturn's moons, known as "shepherd moons." Two of Saturn's small moons orbit within gaps in the main rings, and the rings are divided into seven sections.Saturn has 52 known natural satellites, or moons, and there are probably many more waiting to be discovered. Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, is a bit bigger than the planet Mercury. (Titan is the second-largest moon in the solar system; only Jupiter's moon Ganymede is bigger.) Titan is shrouded in a thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere that might be similar to what Earth's was like long ago. Further study of this moon promises to reveal much about planetary formation and, perhaps, about the early days of Earth. Saturn also has many smaller "icy" satellites. From Enceladus, which shows evidence of recent (and ongoing) surface changes, to Iapetus, with one hemisphere darker than asphalt and the other as bright as snow, each of Saturn's satellites is unique.Though Saturn's magnetic field is not as huge as Jupiter's, it is still 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the solar wind. Hubble Space Telescope images show that Saturn's polar regions have aurorae similar to Earth's. Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines.Voyagers 1 and 2 flew by and photographed Saturn in 1981. The next chapter in our knowledge of Saturn took place between 2005 and 2017, as the Cassini spacecraft continued its exploration of the Saturn system. The Huygens probe descended through Titan's atmosphere in January 2005, collecting data on the atmosphere and surface. Cassini has orbited Saturn more than 70 times during a 12-year study of the planet and its moons, rings, and magnetosphere. With its fuel running out, it drew closer to saturn than ever in late 2016, showing an up-close view of the planet for the first time. Cassini is sponsored by NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency.",
"NASA's MESSENGER mission captured this colorized image of Caloris Basin on Mercury.Named for the fleet-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, zipping around our parent star at an average of 36 million miles away. However, Mercury’s orbit is not a perfect circle. The planet can pass as close as 29 million miles and as far away as 43 million miles.Living up to its name, Mercury is the fastest planet in the solar system, speeding along at about 29 miles per second and completing each orbit around the sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury is also the smallest planet in the solar system, measuring just 3,032 miles wide at its equator. That makes it only slightly larger than Earth’s moon.Because Mercury is so small and so close to the sun, it is the most elusive of the five planets that are visible to the naked eye. You can only catch Mercury at dawn and dusk, and it usually does not rise far above the horizon. But that’s not the only time the tiny planet makes an appearance. Because of its position in the solar system, Mercury passes between Earth and the sun 13 times each century in an event known as a transit. During a transit of Mercury, observers on Earth can see the planet in silhouette as it seems to sweep across the sun’s disk.Since ancient times, people observing the heavens have noticed that the naked-eye planets sometimes appear to move backward, briefly shifting from their usual eastward motion to a westward path across the sky. This retrograde motion is an illusion created when one planet moves faster in its orbit than another, so that it catches up to and passes the slower world. For observers on Earth, Mercury is in retrograde about three to four times a year.If you could watch the skies from the surface of Mercury, you would sometimes catch the rare sight of the sun in retrograde. As Mercury makes its closest approach to our smoldering star, its orbital speed exceeds its rate of rotation on its axis. That means someone standing on Mercury would see the sun start to rise, then briefly set, then rise again all within the same day.Like the other planets in the solar system, Mercury was born about 4.5 billion years ago, condensing from the swirling ring of dust and gas left over from the sun’s formation. Mercury became what’s known as a terrestrial planet, with a dense metallic core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. However, the small planet cooled very quickly, contracting enough within the first billion or so years to prevent magma from escaping through the outer crust and ending geologic activity such as volcanism on the surface.Despite its proximity to our star, Mercury is not the hottest planet in the solar system. With no atmosphere to trap heat, surface temperatures on Mercury can swing from 800 degrees Fahrenheit during the day to -290 degrees Fahrenheit at night. Mercury may even have reservoirs of ice sitting deep inside permanently shadowed craters at its poles. By contrast, the surface of hazy Venus sits at a sweltering 880 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.Lack of an atmosphere also means Mercury’s surface is pockmarked by numerous impact craters, since incoming meteors don’t encounter any friction that would cause them to burn up. Seen via telescopes and spacecraft, Mercury looks like a battered world covered in overlapping basins, soaring cliffs, and occasional smooth plains.Bright lines called crater rays also crisscross the surface where impacts crushed the rock and kicked up reflective debris. One of the most notable features on Mercury is Caloris Basin, an impact crater about 960 miles wide that formed early in the planet’s history. Mercury has no rings, no moons, and a relatively weak magnetic field.Mercury is a scarred world covered in craters, ridges, and bright debris from numerous impacts.NASA’s Mariner 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury, conducting a series of three flybys in 1974 and 1975. During this mission, Mariner 10 photographed about 45 percent of the planet’s surface.A NASA mission called MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, Geochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) became the first probe to orbit Mercury in March 2011. It investigated the planet's composition, the structure of its core, and its magnetic field, in addition to capturing global images of the surface in multiple wavelengths. The mission ended with a planned impact on Mercury's surface in April 2015.In 2018, the European Space Agency is set to launch the BepiColombo mission, which will use two orbiters to further study the innermost planet inside and out.This 1946 image of Earth was the first photograph taken in space.",
"Every month Earth's moon goes through its phases, waning and waxing in its constant transformation from new moon to full moon and back again.This lunar cycle happens in part because the moon does not produce its own light; the silvery glow we see comes from sunlight reflecting off the moon's monochrome surface. In addition, our view of the moon is governed by a gravitational quirk called tidal locking. In essence, it takes roughly the same amount of time for the moon to spin once on its axis as it takes for our celestial companion to complete an orbit around Earth. That means the same side of the moon always faces Earth, although both sides get illuminated as the moon orbits, so there is no perpetual dark side of the moon.As the moon, Earth, and the sun go through their orbital dance, the part of the moon that's illuminated by sunlight moves in and out of our view, creating a predictable series of lunar phases. In any given month we see eight distinct phases of the moon, defined by how much of the lunar disk is illuminated from our perspective and whether the moon is heading toward or away from being full.During this phase the moon is between Earth and the sun, which means none of the lunar half we see is illuminated, and the moon becomes nearly invisible in the night sky. We can see the moon in this phase only during a solar eclipse.As the moon's illuminated surface increases, it's in a stage known as waxing, and it's a crescent as long as it's less than half full.This is the phase when half of the moon is illuminated and the percentage of the lit surface is still increasing.When the moon is more than half full and still increasing its illuminated surface, it's called waxing gibbous. The word “gibbous” comes from the Latin for “hump” and has been used for centuries to describe rounded or convex shapes, like swollen eyes or the back of a camel.In this phase, the moon is behind Earth with respect to the sun, and its face is fully illuminated. This is when we can sometimes see lunar eclipses.This is the stage when the moon is more than half lit but the illuminated surface we can see is decreasing.During this phase, the moon is once again half illuminated, but the lit area that's visible is on the decline.As the next new moon nears, the moon shrinks back to a crescent that's less than half full.One of the most dramatic sights in the night sky—and inspiration for poets, artists, and lovers for millennia—full moons captivate us like nothing else. Full moons occur every 29.5 days or so, as the moon moves to the side of Earth directly opposite the sun.For millennia, humans have used the movement of the moon to keep track of the passing year and set schedules for hunting, planting, and harvesting. Ancient cultures the world over have given these full moons names based on the behavior of the plants, animals, or weather during that month.Native Americans and medieval Europeans supposedly named January's full moon after the howling of hungry wolves lamenting the midwinter paucity of food. Other names for this month's full moon include old moon and ice moon.The typically cold, snowy weather of February in North America earned this full moon its name. Other common names include storm moon and hunger moon.This last full moon of winter was named the worm moon after the worm trails that would appear in the newly thawed ground. Other names include chaste moon, death moon, crust moon (a reference to snow that would become crusty as it thawed during the day and froze at night), and sap moon, after the tapping of the maple trees.Northern Native Americans call April's full moon the pink moon after a species of early blooming wildflower. In other cultures, this moon is called the sprouting grass moon, the egg moon, and the fish moon.May's abundant blooms give its full moon the name flower moon in many cultures. Other names include the hare moon, the corn planting moon, and the milk moon.In North America, the harvesting of strawberries in June gives that month's full moon its name. Europeans have dubbed it the rose moon, while other cultures named it the hot moon for the beginning of summer heat.Male deer, which shed their antlers every year, begin to regrow them in July, hence the Native American name for July's full moon. Other names include thunder moon, for the month's many summer storms, and hay moon, after the July hay harvest.North American fishing tribes called August's full moon the sturgeon moon, since the species was traditionally abundant during this month. It's also been called the green corn moon, the grain moon, and the red moon for the reddish hue it often takes on in the summer haze.The most familiar named moon, September's harvest moon refers to the time of year after the northern autumn equinox when crops are gathered. Other names include the corn moon and the barley moon.The first moon after the harvest moon is the hunter's moon, so named as the preferred month to hunt summer-fattened deer and fox unable to hide in now bare fields. The hunter's moon is also particularly bright and long-lasting in the sky, giving hunters the opportunity to stalk prey at night. Other names include the travel moon and the dying grass moon.There is disagreement over the origin of November's beaver moon name. Some say it comes from Native Americans setting beaver traps during this month, while others say the name comes from the heavy activity of beavers building their winter dams. Another name is the frost moon.The coming of winter earned December's full moon the name cold moon. Other names include the long night moon and the oak moon.Blue moons are not actually blue, and despite the common turn of phrase, they are not especially rare. While the precise definition has changed over the years, the term “blue moon” is commonly used today to describe a second full moon appearing in a calendar month, which happens every two and a half years, on average.The moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle, and its distance to our planet changes over the course of an orbital cycle. When a full moon coincides with an especially close approach, or perigee, the lunar orb is slightly bigger and brighter than average, delivering what's come to be known as a supermoon.",
"Humans have recorded solar eclipses for millennia, and references to them can be found in some of humanity’s earliest texts, such as ancient Chinese academic documents. Debate even swirls around a line from Homer's Odyssey—"The sun has been obliterated from the sky"—and whether it can be tied to a historic eclipse.Through the ages, the sudden darkening of the sun has been seen as a signal of the displeasure of the gods or an omen of bad things to come. But once astronomers figured out how solar eclipses worked, they became events to be studied and celebrated.Solar eclipses happen only during a new moon, when the lunar orb moves between Earth and the sun. However, because the moon orbits Earth at a slight angle, the three bodies will only periodically line up on the same plane to create a solar eclipse.During a total solar eclipse, the moon is in just the right position to briefly cast a shadow on our planet. As the moon moves and Earth spins, this shadow races across the planet's surface at some 1,400 miles an hour, creating a relatively narrow line called the path of totality. Only sky watchers within this line—typically 10,000 miles long and just 100 miles wide—experience a total solar eclipse. People near it see only a partial solar eclipse, in which not all of the sun is blotted out, while those farther away see no change at all.Seeing a solar eclipse can be an unforgettable experience, but experts urge caution. Looking directly at the sun with your naked eyes, or through unprotected telescopes or binoculars, can cause eye damage and even permanent blindness. Special eclipse glasses that filter out the sun's most damaging rays can allow you to view the phenomenon safely, as can instruments fitted with solar filters, or simple devices called pinhole cameras that let you see a solar eclipse indirectly.A total solar eclipse begins as a barely perceptible nibble out of the sun. Over the next hour or so, the darkness spreads and eventually consumes the solar disk, turning day to night. This state, called totality, can last as long as seven and a half minutes, although it is usually less than that. During totality, some stars and planets become visible, the air temperature drops, and animals from insects to cows may change their behavior. This brief phase is the only time it's safe to look at an eclipse with your naked eyes.The only visible part of the sun during totality is its corona, the faint and normally unseen outer atmosphere that shimmers in the darkness like a fiery ring. Astronomers can use solar eclipses to study the corona from the ground, gathering clues to its behavior that may one day help solve the mystery of why the sun's upper atmosphere is actually hotter than its surface.In 1919 Sir Arthur Eddington's expedition to watch a total solar eclipse from the island of Príncipe, off the west coast of Africa, helped confirm Einstein's general theory of relativity. According to Einstein's work, gravity from massive objects should warp the fabric of spacetime and so bend light.Eddington realized that a total solar eclipse would provide the perfect test bed for this prediction, since light coming from much more distant stars should get bent ever so slightly as it passes by the sun, and the eclipse would allow scientists to see stars close enough to the sun's edge to detect this minuscule change. The experiment was a success, and news of the result helped launch Einstein into scientific stardom.Total solar eclipses are only visible on Earth because of a lucky coincidence: The moon's diameter and distance from Earth make its relative size just big enough to cover the sun's disk. If the moon were any smaller or farther away, we would see only partial eclipses. In fact, measurements of the distance between Earth and the moon show that our cosmic companion is slowly spiraling away from us, and in a billion years or so, the moon will have drifted so far from Earth that total solar eclipses will no longer occur.In addition, the moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle, and its precise distance changes with each orbital cycle. Even today, sometimes the moon's apparent size is too small to fully cover the sun during an eclipse. When this happens, we see what's called an annular eclipse, also dubbed a ring of fire. In this case, the moon appears as a blackened circle surrounded by sunlight. Even during its total phase, it's not safe to view this kind of eclipse without proper eye protection.Total solar eclipses occur every one or two years, on average, and partial and annular eclipses are only slightly more frequent. Because solar eclipses are visible from such a small area on Earth each time, the chance of observing one from any single spot is less than once in a lifetime.",
"Every so often, the silvery orb of the full moon undergoes a dramatic transformation. Darkness slips across the lunar face, and for a while, the entire moon may be colored a deep blood red.This is what's known as a total lunar eclipse, when the moon, the sun, and Earth line up in just the right way for the moon to be engulfed in Earth's shadow. This cosmic phenomenon has delighted or terrified humanity throughout recorded history, and astronomers have learned how to track celestial motions to predict when a lunar eclipse will occur years to centuries in advance.Lunar eclipses happen when the moon moves behind Earth, from the sun's perspective. When the moon is completely swallowed up by the darkest part of the planet's shadow, we see a total lunar eclipse. Its peak, called totality, can last for up to an hour and 47 minutes, while the full eclipse can last about six hours from start to finish as the moon slips behind Earth and then emerges on the other side.During totality, the lunar orb changes color and becomes yellow, ruddy orange, or even a deep crimson, which is why a total lunar eclipse is sometimes called a blood moon. This ominous-looking effect appears because the moon does not generate its own light, and what we normally see as moonlight is really reflected light from the sun.While most of that sunlight is blocked during a total lunar eclipse, some of it gets bent and scattered as it filters through Earth's atmosphere, so that only longer, redder wavelengths make it through. The exact color we see on the moon depends on how much dust is in Earth's atmosphere, since dust can absorb more of the filtered light and thus deepen the eclipsed moon's hue.Total lunar eclipses can only happen when the moon is full, which means they can coincide with other full-moon phenomena, such as supermoons, blue moons, and harvest moons. But while we typically see one full moon a month, not every month delivers a lunar eclipse. That's because the moon's orbit around Earth is slightly tilted, and it only passes through the planet's cone-shaped shadow at specific times.The total lunar eclipse of December 2011 glows in the evening sky over the Zagros Mountains of Iran.That tilt is why each eclipse can be seen at different times and from different places on Earth, although astronomers have noticed that lunar eclipses follow a long-term pattern called the Saros cycle that causes eclipses to share similar attributes through time.What's more, not every lunar eclipse completely covers the moon's disk. During a partial lunar eclipse, only part of the moon passes through the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra, and the rest of the moon stays illuminated by the sun. And during a penumbral eclipse, all or part of the moon passes through the brighter part of Earth's shadow, and we see very little effect here on Earth.Today, lunar eclipses are cause for celebration, and many people host eclipse- viewing parties and even travel great distances to see one in person. But past eclipses have sparked a number of myths and legends linked to more colorful interpretations for the moon's vanishing act.The Inca, for instance, told stories of a jaguar attacking the moon and turning it bloody, while the Mesopotamians believed the moon was being assaulted by demons. And the Batammaliba people in Togo and Benin interpret a lunar eclipse as the sun and moon working through a feud.Thanks to our understanding of the ongoing dance of orbital dynamics, astronomers are able to calculate when eclipses must have happened in the past. By checking those dates against written accounts, scientists can determine when a total lunar eclipse must have happened during a moment of historical significance.Enjoy total lunar eclipses while they last: Measurements of the distance between Earth and the moon show that our lunar companion is spiraling away from us at about 3.8 centimeters a year. In a billion years or so, the moon will be too far away to be fully enveloped by Earth's shadow, and blood moons will become the stuff of legend.",
"This image of the sun taken on October 24, 2014, shows a significant solar flare that erupted from a large active region.Compared with the billions of other stars in the universe, the sun is unremarkable. But for Earth and the other planets that revolve around it, the sun is a powerful center of attention. It holds the solar system together; provides life-giving light, heat, and energy to Earth; and generates space weather.The sun resides some 26,000 light-years from the Milky Way's center, in a tendril of our home galaxy known as the Orion Arm. Every 230 million years, the sun—and the solar system it carries with it—makes one orbit around the Milky Way's center. Though we can't feel it, the sun traces its orbit at an average velocity of 450,000 miles an hour.The sun formed more than 4.5 billion years ago, when a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula collapsed under its own gravity. As it did, the cloud spun and flattened into a disk, with our sun forming at its center. The disk's outskirts later accreted into our solar system, including Earth and the other planets. Scientists have even managed to see these planet-birthing disks around our sun's distant young cousins.Our home star is a yellow dwarf, a medium-size variety that's fairly common in our galaxy. The label “yellow” is misleading, though, since our sun burns a bright white. On Earth, the sun can take on warmer hues, especially at sunrise or sunset, because our planet's atmosphere scatters blue and green light the most.From our perspective, “dwarf” might not be the best word for our sun, either. At about 864,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) wide, the sun is 109 times wider than Earth, and it accounts for more than 99.8 percent of the solar system's total mass. If it was a hollow ball, more than a million Earths could fit inside it. But the sun isn't hollow: It's filled with scorching gases and soups of electrically charged particles called plasma. The sun's surface temperature is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius), and it's 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 million Celsius) at the core.Deep in the sun's core, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen to helium, which generates energy. Particles of light called photons carry this energy through a spherical shell called the radiative zone to the top layer of the solar interior, the convection zone. There, hot plasmas rise and fall like the ooze in a lava lamp, which transfers energy to the sun's surface, called the photosphere.It can take 170,000 years for a photon to complete its journey out of the sun, but once it exits, it zips through space at more than 186,000 miles a second. Solar photons reach Earth about eight minutes after they're freed from the sun's interior, crossing an average of 93 million miles to get here—a distance defined as one astronomical unit (AU).Out beyond the sun's photosphere lies the atmosphere, which consists of the chromosphere and the solar corona. The chromosphere looks like a reddish glow fringing the sun, while the corona's huge white tendrils extend millions of miles long. The chromosphere and corona also emit visible light, but on Earth's surface, they can be seen only during a total solar eclipse, when the moon passes between Earth and the sun.The corona runs far hotter than the photosphere, hitting temperatures of more than a million degrees Fahrenheit. How the corona gets so hot remains a scientific mystery, which is partly why NASA launched its Parker Solar Probe, the fastest spacecraft ever built, and the first ever sent into the corona. (Read more about the spacecraft that will “touch the sun.”)In addition to light, the sun radiates heat and a steady stream of charged particles known as the solar wind. The wind blows about 280 miles (450 kilometers) a second throughout the solar system, extending the sun's magnetic field out more than 10 billion miles. Beyond that distance, the solar wind gives way to the colder, dense material that drifts in between stars, forming a boundary called the heliopause. So far, just two spacecraft—Voyager 1 and Voyager 2—have crossed this cosmic threshold, which defines the start of interstellar space.Every so often, a patch of particles will burst from the sun in a solar flare, which can disrupt satellite communications and knock out power on Earth. Flares usually stem from the activity of sunspots, cool regions of the photosphere that form and dissipate as the sun's internal magnetic field shifts. Solar flares and sunspots obey a regular cycle, rising and falling in number every 11 years as the poles of the sun's magnetic field flip back and forth.Sometimes, the sun will also launch huge bubbles of magnetized particles from its corona, in events called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Some CMEs can grow as large as the sun itself and fling as much as a billion tons of material in a given direction. As they rush from the sun, CMEs can send huge shockwaves through the solar wind. If a CME collided with Earth, its particles could pack enough power to fry electronics in orbit and on Earth's surface.Like many energy sources, the sun will not last forever. It has already used up nearly half of the hydrogen in its core. The sun will continue to burn through the hydrogen for another five billion years or so, and then helium will become its primary fuel. At that point, the sun will expand to about a hundred times its current size, swallowing Mercury and Venus—and maybe Earth. It will burn as a red giant star for another billion years and then collapse into a white dwarf star.",
"An illustration shows NASA's Parker Solar Probe approaching the sun.For nearly five billion years, the sun has been ready for its close-up—and NASA is now at last on its way to reach out and brush the face of our home star.After a few delays, the Parker Solar Probe launched at 3:31 a.m. ET on August 12, riding a ULA Delta IV rocket on a path toward solar orbit. Equipped with four instrument suites, the probe is—of course—solar-powered, and will be drinking in the energy of the star it’s studying over the course of its seven-year journey.Its mission? To solve some of the stubbornly persistent mysteries about the sun by getting closer than ever before.“The sun is ... always changing, it’s always in motion, it goes through periods of incredible violence,” says Alex Young of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “It’s an incredibly dynamic star.”The sun has powered life on Earth for billions of years, and it has anchored theologies and fueled myths throughout human history. It is inescapable, its presence undeniable except in the rarest of earthly environments.And yet, we really don’t understand how the sun works.For more than a century, astronomers have studied this nearest of stars. They’ve stared at it in every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum, using Earth- and space-based telescopes that are specially designed to withstand the searing glare of its blazing face. But no matter how hard scientists have tried, they haven’t been able to crack its code.Perhaps that’s because until now, no telescope has ventured close enough to really study the star at the center of it all.“We need to get into this action region where all the mysteries are, really,” says project scientist Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.Named after 91-year-old astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who first identified the supersonic stream of particles called the solar wind, the probe’s science objectives are broadly three-pronged.Billowing out from the sun, the solar wind stretches right to the edge of the solar system, accelerating from a relatively lazy breeze near the star to a faster-than-sound barrage of energy and matter that whips through space at millions of miles an hour.Among the burning questions the mission aims to answer is what accelerates that solar wind, and why it’s so speedy—a phenomenon that will illuminate the inner workings of the star itself, and might even help with nuclear fusion experiments on Earth.The spacecraft will also be studying the storms that sometimes erupt on the sun’s surface and sling huge blobs of material into space called coronal mass ejections. If these charged clouds slam into Earth, they can produce beautiful auroras—but they are also dangerous for astronauts and can disrupt communications systems and power grids.Shimmering curtains of light adorn the night sky over Alaska. Known as the aurora borealis, or northern lights, these displays are created when charged particles from the sun interact with gases in Earth's atmosphere.“We have technology, we have people in space, and we have got to understand and characterize this place we’re traveling though,” Young says.Solving these mysteries means that the probe needs to make multiple trips through the sun’s corona, the portion of its upper atmosphere that burns at several million degrees Fahrenheit. That presents yet another solar puzzle: Scientists don’t know why the corona is so unbelievable hot, while the surface of the sun is a comparatively chill 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.“Why is the corona 300 times hotter than the surface of the sun?” Fox asks. That’s another question the mission hopes to answer.Slipping into that sweltering realm is no simple feat, and the Parker Solar Probe will eventually be going faster than any spacecraft ever has. By the time it makes its final solar loop seven years from now, the spacecraft will be speeding over the sun’s surface at 430,000 miles an hour, fast enough to get from San Francisco to Los Angeles in less than three seconds.Its journey to the heart of the solar system will start with a pass by Venus in October, which will help focus the probe’s orbit toward the sun. And then, “we will encounter Venus another six times during our seven-year mission, allowing us to walk closer and closer into the sun until at our closest approach we are just 3.83 million miles above the sun’s surface,” Fox says.If you think that sounds like a terrible place to hang out, you’re right. The spacecraft is wearing a special, 4.5-inch-thick heat shield that will protect the four suites of onboard instruments from the sun’s intense heat. Made of carbon composites, the shield is a sandwich-like design that incorporates foam, mesh, and plates of material.“Most of the instruments sit on the main body of the spacecraft and are well in the shadow provided by the heat shield,” Fox says.A few of them, however, will be peeking out from behind the 160-pound shield as they collect crucial data about magnetic fields, radiation, particles, and energy.If all goes well, the mission will last for at least seven years. When it’s time to say goodbye to the Parker Solar Probe, mission managers will let the spacecraft sail into oblivion.“Once we run out of fuel,” Fox says, “the spacecraft will start to turn, and at that point, parts of the body that are not designed to see the full solar environment will then melt.” And as the spacecraft gets smaller and smaller, its bits and pieces will ultimately become one with the sun.",
"When they reach the end of their long evolutions, smaller stars—those up to eight times as massive as our own sun—typically become white dwarfs.These ancient stars are incredibly dense. A teaspoonful of their matter would weigh as much on Earth as an elephant—5.5 tons. White dwarfs typically have a radius just .01 times that of our own sun, but their mass is about the same.Stars like our sun fuse hydrogen in their cores into helium. White dwarfs are stars that have burned up all of the hydrogen they once used as nuclear fuel.Fusion in a star's core produces heat and outward pressure, but this pressure is kept in balance by the inward push of gravity generated by a star's mass. When the hydrogen used as fuel vanishes, and fusion slows, gravity causes the star to collapse in on itself.As the star condenses and compacts, it heats up even further, burning the last of its hydrogen and causing the star's outer layers to expand outward. At this stage, the star becomes a large red giant.Because a red giant is so large, its heat spreads out and the surface temperatures are predominantly cool, but its core remains red-hot. Red giants exist for only a short time—perhaps just a billion years–compared with the ten billion the same star may already have spent burning hydrogen like our own sun.The brightest star in the nighttime sky, Sirius, or the Dog Star, greatly outshines its white dwarf companion, Sirius B. At 8.6 light-years away, Sirius B is the nearest known white dwarf star to Earth.Red giants are hot enough to turn the helium at their core, which was made by fusing hydrogen, into heavy elements like carbon. But most stars are not massive enough to create the pressures and heat necessary to burn heavy elements, so fusion and heat production stop.Such stars eventually blow off the material of their outer layers, which creates an expanding shell of gas called a planetary nebula. Within this nebula, the hot core of the star remains—crushed to high density by gravity—as a white dwarf with temperatures over 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit (100,000 degrees Celsius).Eventually—over tens or even hundreds of billions of years—a white dwarf cools until it becomes a black dwarf, which emits no energy. Because the universe's oldest stars are only 10 billion to 20 billion years old there are no known black dwarfs—yet.Estimating how long white dwarfs have been cooling can help astronomers learn much about the age of the universe.Ancient white dwarf stars shine in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars like our sun fuse hydrogen in their cores into helium. White dwarfs are stars that have burned up all of the hydrogen they once used as nuclear fuel.But not all white dwarfs will spend many millennia cooling their heels. Those in a binary star system may have a strong enough gravitational pull to gather in material from a neighboring star. When a white dwarf takes on enough mass in this manner it reaches a level called the chandrasekhar limit. At this point the pressure at its center will become so great that runaway fusion occurs and the star will detonate in a thermonuclear supernova.",
"The full moon rises behind silhouetted climbers on Mount Artos in Turkey's Van Province on July 27. Later that night, the brilliant orb would become a "blood moon" during the longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century.On the night of July 27 and into the morning of July 28, lucky observers got to witness a once-in-a-lifetime meeting in the sky: the longest “blood moon” eclipse of the 21st century, flanked by a big, brilliant Mars as it heads toward its closest approach to Earth since 2003.The moon and Mars were traveling the night sky together, separated by less than the width of a hand held at arm's length. Stargazers in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America were able to see at least part of the total lunar eclipse. With a maximum eclipse lasting one hour, 42 minutes, and 57 seconds, this event marks the longest eclipse of its kind that will happen this century.Not everyone got to enjoy the view. People in the Arctic, most of the Pacific Ocean, and North America missed out on the lunar show. And even for people in the right regions, clear skies were hardly a given. But wherever possible, photographers were training their gaze on the sky to capture the epic eclipse in stunning detail.Above are our favorite photographs of the event, selected in near-real time by National Geographic photo editors.This photo is one of the first glimpses of the 2017 total solar eclipse captured by National Geographic photographer Babak Tafreshi in a jet above the Pacific at the moment the eclipse began. Babak was aboard the flight along with two Airbnb guests who won the chance to be among the first to witness the solar eclipse before it crossed the U.S. in August.",
"Earth's shadow darkens the moon at the start of a total lunar eclipse in December 2010.Get ready for a celestial double feature unlike anything seen in decades: Mars is about to make its closest approach to Earth in 15 years—just as the full moon blushes red in the longest “blood moon” eclipse of the century.Both the moon and Mars will dominate the overnight hours on July 27 and into the morning of July 28, traveling across the sky beside each other while appearing to be separated by only five degrees, equal to the width of three middle fingers held at arm’s length. (See our favorite photos of the blood moon eclipse from around the world.)On the 27th, the red planet will reach opposition and be just a few days shy of swinging the closest it has come to Earth since August 2003, allowing sky-watchers around the world to see our neighboring world that night about as big and bright it can ever get in our skies.And while you shouldn’t expect Mars to look as big as the full moon, as many online hoaxes in past years have suggested, you will also get to see the actual moon painted red as it undergoes a total lunar eclipse.During a total eclipse, sunlight shining through Earth's dusty atmosphere is bent, or refracted, toward the red part of the spectrum as it is cast onto the moon's surface. As a result, expect to see the lunar disk go from a dark gray color when the eclipse starts to a reddish-orange color during totality.This photo is one of the first glimpses of the 2017 total solar eclipse captured by National Geographic photographer Babak Tafreshi in a jet above the Pacific at the moment the eclipse began. Babak was aboard the flight along with two Airbnb guests who won the chance to be among the first to witness the solar eclipse before it crossed the U.S. in August.At 1 a.m. ET (5:00 UT) on July 27, Mars will reach what astronomers call opposition. This is when the sun, Earth, and Mars are aligned in a straight path, so that Mars appears to rise in the east just as the sun sets in the west, making the sunlit side of the planet visible all night long.Mars reaches opposition only once every 26 months, when Earth manages to overtake the planet in its tighter track around the sun. But unlike Earth’s more circular orbit, Mars’s path around the sun is fairly elliptical. That means the distance between the two worlds varies, making some oppositions better than others.Mars will make its closest approach to Earth for this year on July 31, coming just 35.8 million miles (57.6 million kilometers) away. Such a close approach just a few days after opposition means the July 27 alignment will be your best bet to see the red planet shine its biggest and brightest until 2035. (Here's how close encounters with Mars have helped us map the red planet.)An illustration shows the orbital paths of the inner planets, including Earth and Mars.The previous best encounter occurred 15 years ago, when Mars was a record-breaking 35 million miles (56 million kilometers) distant. Such an epic encounter won’t happen again until 2287.In addition to offering beautiful views, opposition has traditionally set the stage for robotic invasions of Mars. Because of Mars’s proximity and alignment with our planet, the time around opposition is the best for sending spacecraft, saving travel time and fuel costs. For instance, NASA’s Insight lander launched on May 5 and is headed for a Mars landing this November.Many keen-eyed onlookers may have already noticed the fiery planet growing brighter in our night skies the past few months, making it easy to spot with nothing more than the naked eye. To track down the warrior planet for yourself, go outside after dusk on any clear night and look for the bright beacon rising above the eastern horizon. Mars will glide high over the southern sky throughout the night, setting in the west by dawn.Most of the time, Mars is not much to look at through a telescope, but that changes during opposition, when the planet becomes a disk filled with tantalizing features. Even a small telescope with about a six-inch mirror will be able to tease out surface details like the southern ice cap (where astronomers may have just found an underground lake) and distinct, dark regions that are windswept, rocky fields.However, a colossal dust storm has been raging for the past two months on Mars and has enveloped most of the planet, which means telescope views have been a bit hindered. But you can plainly see the effect of all this dust with the naked eye: Mars currently appears to shine with a more yellowish tinge rather than its usual rusty orange hue.Also on July 27, fortunate sky-watchers in South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia will get to see at least part of the longest-lasting total lunar eclipse of the 21st century. The entire event will last nearly four hours, with the maximum eclipse lasting for one hour, 42 minutes, and 57 seconds from 19:30 to 21:13 UTC.North Americans will mostly miss out on this lunar eclipse, as the moon will not have risen yet. But the lunar display can be observed in its partial phases rising over South America, western Africa, and Europe and setting over Eastern Asia and Australia. The entire eclipse will be visible from eastern Africa and central Asia.During a lunar eclipse, Earth casts its shadow on the moon. This doesn't happen every time the moon makes its monthly trek around Earth because the moon's orbit is tilted with respect to the planet, so the lunar orb usually glides above or below Earth's shadow.Total lunar eclipses happen only during a full moon and only when the sun, Earth, and moon are precisely aligned so that our planet's shadow completely blankets the moon’s disk. This usually happens roughly twice a year and can be seen from only one hemisphere at a time.Popularly known these days as blood moons, a total lunar eclipse can color the lunar orb differently depending on the amount of dust in Earth's atmosphere. Active volcanoes spewing tons of ash into the upper atmosphere, for instance, can trigger deep blood-red eclipses. But no one can predict exactly what color we'll see before each eclipse. (Also find out why the moon looks bigger near the horizon.)No matter its hue, this blood moon will linger longer thanks to a celestial coincidence. First, the moon will be cutting through the center of Earth’s deep umbral shadow rather than glancing across the shadow’s edges. Second, the full moon will appear smaller and will be traveling a bit slower across our sky.The full moon and Mars will be separated by just five degrees on July 27.That’s because the moon will be at its most distant point from Earth in its month-long orbit—known as apogee—during the time of the eclipse. This apogee full moon has been dubbed a minimoon, the opposite of the more popular supermoon, which occurs when the moon is at its closest to Earth.During this week’s eclipse, the apogee moon will make the lunar disk appear 13 percent smaller than average, and it will take a bit longer for it to glide through Earth’s shadow. We won’t get to see such a long totality again until June 9, 2123.You don’t have to miss out if you are in the wrong region or if clouds ruin your view: You can still check out the eclipse online via live webcasts from Virtual Telescope, Slooh, and timeanddate.live.Enjoy the show!Andrew Fazekas, the Night Sky Guy, is the author of Star Trek: The Official Guide to the Night Sky.

"A supermoon is an astronomical phenomenon in which Earth’s moon is full, on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun (a state called syzygy), and at its closest point to the planet (a state called perigee).The coincidence of these lunar events usually only happens occasionally, even as infrequently as once a year.Scientifically referred to as a perigee-syzygy moon, a supermoon can appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than a full moon at apogee, or the point when it’s furthest away from the Earth.The colloquial term “supermoon” was created in 1979 by Richard Nolle, an American astrologist. He claimed the lunar event would cause natural disasters; however, this prediction is unfounded.",
"This photo is one of the first glimpses of the 2017 total solar eclipse captured by National Geographic photographer Babak Tafreshi in a jet above the Pacific at the moment the eclipse began. Babak was aboard the flight along with two Airbnb guests who won the chance to be among the first to witness the solar eclipse before it crossed the U.S. in August.The “Great American Eclipse”on August 21, 2017 was the first total solar eclipse the United States had seen in 38 years, and the first time in almost 100 years that the path of totality crossed from coast to coast. For a couple of minutes, locations along a narrow path from the Pacific Northwest to the southeast Atlantic coast saw day turn into night as the moon completely blocked out the sun.Not all of us were lucky enough to board a transcontinental flight to follow the moon’s shadow, so we here we bring you the next best thing: over a dozen National Geographic photographers strategically positioned along the way. We started with astronomy photographer Babak Tafreshi in a jet above the Pacific at the moment the eclipse began, then touched down in Oregon to continue on-the-ground coverage all the way to South Carolina.",
"When you wish upon a falling star, you're actually offering your hopes and dreams to a small piece of space rock burning up as it plummets through Earth's atmosphere. Known as meteors, these brilliant streaks of light have entranced humans for centuries, especially when they arrive in bursts of blazing glory during sky shows called meteor showers.Scientists have known since the mid-1800s that almost all meteor showers are born from icy comets. When one of these visitors from deep space enters the inner part of the solar system, heat from the sun causes ices on the comet's surface to change from ice to gas, a process called sublimation. This is what produces a comet's beautiful tail.As the ices vaporize, the comet releases dust, sand grain-size particles, and even a few boulder-sized chunks of stone that get left behind in its wake. With each orbit, that process creates a stream of debris along the comet's path that persists long after the dirty iceball has headed back out to the edges of the solar system.In some cases, Earth crosses through the debris streams during its trip around the sun. As the planet plows through the cometary leftovers, rocky bits slam into our atmosphere and burn up, creating a spectacular display in the night sky. And we are not alone; meteor showers also happen on Mars, although the red planet sees different displays based on the cometary paths it crosses.A meteor from the annual Perseid meteor shower shoots by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Radio Telescope near Cambridge, England.A few meteors may fall on any given night, but the best time to watch for them is during the peak of an annual meteor shower. This is when Earth crosses through a particularly dense part of a comet's debris stream, an event that happens at predictable times each year.Seen from Earth's surface, the meteors in annual showers appear to radiate from particular points in the night sky. Most showers are therefore named after the constellation from which they seem to fall. For instance, the prolific Perseid meteor shower that happens every August is named for its origin in the area of the constellation Perseus, the mythical hero.Each major meteor shower has different peak rates at which its shooting stars fall. Some, like the Lyrids in April, see rates of about 15 to 20 meteors an hour. Others, like the Geminids in December, deliver as many as 60 to 70 meteors an hour.But comet debris streams are not entirely uniform, and some normally weak showers are known for producing occasional outbursts of up to a thousand meteors an hour, while others will punctuate the sky show with bright fireballs. The different annual showers also see meteors fall at different speeds, which can affect how long the streaks last in the sky.Unfortunately, astronomers can't predict when a given meteor shower will produce especially dazzling displays with much accuracy. And some of the major meteor showers are best seen from either the Southern or Northern hemisphere, depending on their associated constellation. To offer a more controlled experience, one company in Japan has proposed a way to create artificial meteor showers using satellites and specially designed “meteors” made of chemical-filled pellets.The best way to experience a natural meteor shower is to head into darker rural areas, away from light pollution, and wait for the shower's radiant constellation to rise high in the sky. Allow your eyes to adjust to the dark, and then watch out for the ephemeral bursts of light.",
"A Perseid meteor crosses the night sky over a statue of Jesus Christ in a Belarusian village on August 13, 2016.Ancient accounts are full of astronomical observations, from a 3,400-year-old solar eclipse to a depiction of Halley's comet on the 11th-century Bayeux Tapestry. The annual Perseid meteor shower, for instance, was first noted in Chinese records in A.D. 36.But the earliest recognition that the Perseids are a recurring event may have its source in Christian tradition and the grisly death of one of its early saints. (Read more on how to see the 2018 Perseid meteor shower.)Several astronomers are believed to have independently "discovered" the Perseids in the 1830s, yet some scientists at the time conceded in their reports that European Christians had been long aware of the celestial phenomenon—just with a very different explanation for its origin."The annual occurrence of a meteoric display about the 10th of August appears to have been recognized for a very great length of time," wrote Edward Herrick, one of the first astronomers to observe the Perseids, in the 1839 volume of The American Journal of Science and Arts."[A] superstition has 'for ages' existed among the Catholics of some parts of England and Germany, that the burning tears of St. Lawrence are seen in the sky on the night of the 10th of August; this day being the anniversary of his martyrdom."So who was Saint Lawrence? According to Christian tradition, he was an early deacon of the church who was put to death on August 10 in A.D. 258 under the orders of the Roman emperor Valerian.In a suitably gory end for a Christian martyr, it's claimed that the deacon was literally grilled to death over hot coals, and that he had the temerity before his death to tell his pagan torturers that he was "done" on one side and to turn him over. (Perhaps for this reason, Saint Lawrence is now considered the patron saint of chefs.)Although the anniversary of the martyrdom of Lawrence has been observed since at least the middle of the fourth century, it's impossible to say when the annual August Perseid display became associated with the saint's feast day and his fiery tears.Nonetheless, there's "no doubt that the 'saint's tears' would have been well known by Christians long before astronomers caught on," says archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni, who is studying stars depicted on church ceilings for a forthcoming book on constellations."When people pray to heaven, they expect an answer, so they expect to see a sign from heaven," he adds. "What more prominent sign can you get than the tears of a saint washing over you from the heavens?"",
"A composite image shows Perseid meteors cutting through the stars wheeling over Yorkshire Dales National Park in the U.K.Sky-watchers around the world are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the Perseid meteor shower, which will be at its best from August 12 to 13. Often one of the most impressive spectacles of its kind, the Perseid shower should be especially vivid this year because the sky will be moonless and dark during the peak.The Perseids are actually visible from July 17 to August 24, although you’ll see only a few meteors an hour throughout most of that time period. The sky show spikes on the peak dates, with an expected average of 90 shooting stars an hour.Last year, the glare from a gibbous moon dampened the annual spectacle. But for 2018, the dark new moon arrives on August 11, only two days before the Perseids peak. That means the best part of the shower will coincide with just a thin crescent moon, which will set very soon after darkness falls.If you have clear skies, this deep darkness should deliver a great performance on the evening of August 12, with rates of up to 120 shootings stars an hour visible from countryside locales. Observers in eastern North America, Europe, and the Middle East should get the best seats for this meteor bonanza, since the exact peak is expected to occur at 9 p.m. ET (01:00 UT).While you can start hunting for Perseids as soon as it gets dark, the best viewing may be after local midnight and into the predawn hours of the 13th, when the skies will be at their darkest and your part of the globe will face the incoming meteor cloud. (See pictures of the Perseid meteor shower.)Meteors will be visible even under bright suburban skies, but you can expect to see only a quarter to half as many shooting stars. No matter where you are, allow about half an hour for your eyes to adjust to the darkness before you start sky-watching in earnest.The Perseids grace our skies when Earth plows through a cloud of fragments left behind by comet Swift-Tuttle, which last flew near the sun back in 1992. As the comet zooms in from the outer reaches of the solar system, its ices vaporize, and it releases debris ranging in size from sand grains to boulders. The particles get spread along the comet’s orbital path in such a way that Earth crosses the debris field around mid-August every year.An illustration shows the orbital path of comet Swift-Tuttle.When that happens, the comet pieces slam into our atmosphere at speeds of around a hundred thousand miles an hour, causing the meteors to burn up and produce the brilliant streaks across the sky that we affectionately call shooting stars. (Here’s how scientists think we can create artificial meteor showers.)Meteors will appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, the mythical hero, which will rise after local midnight in the northeastern sky.Despite their Greek namesake, the earliest known record of the Perseids appears in ancient Chinese texts, which mention awe-inspiring views of over a hundred meteors an hour as far back as A.D. 36.Reported sightings continued throughout the centuries in many other cultures. In Europe, devout Catholics once referred to the phenomenon as the “tears of St. Lawrence,” since the yearly display coincided with the anniversary of the death of Lawrence the martyr. But astronomers didn’t recognize the link between the sky show and comets until the late 1800s.Perseid meteors seem to radiate from their namesake constellation, as seen in an illustration.If you want to get a keepsake of this year’s shower, try grabbing a photo. All you need is a tripod-mounted digital SLR camera that can take long exposures of 15 seconds or more.Use a wide lens to capture as much of the overhead sky as possible, and set your camera to ISO 400 to pick up fainter shooting stars. You can also set a remote timer to eliminate any camera shake.Keep in mind that taking a picture of the Perseids involves some patience and luck. It can take many minutes before a single meteor crosses your frame, so experiment with images lasting up to 40 seconds each, and keep taking images for as long as possible.If you're not in a prime position or don't have clear skies, you can still enjoy the show via livestreams online, such as this one from Slooh:Clear skies!*This story has been updated to include a livestream of the meteor shower.This iconic Hubble image of the spiral galaxy NGC 1300 is suffused with detail—bright blue young stars, the dust lanes spiraling around the bright nucleus, distant galaxies shining through.",
"Austria’s Grossglockner High Alpine Road switchbacks up to Edelweiss-Spitze, its highest vantage point. Completed in 1935, the serpentine highway was built on the traces of ancient Celtic and Roman trails.There’s nothing like a road trip: scenic views, surprising stops, the time spent with friends or with your own thoughts. But with untold millions of miles of roadways tracing the globe, it can be hard to pick the best route. Here are 10 of the world’s best road trips.The Trans-Andean Highway delivers more thrills than a theme park, coiling along more than 200 miles of mountain passes between Chile’s booming capital and western Argentina’s Mendoza wine country. A defunct railway tracing part of the route only adds to the roller-coaster effect.A major commercial thoroughfare through the continent’s Southern Cone, the challenging road also offers magnificent sightseeing. Twenty-nine hairpin turns climb some 11,500 feet on the Chilean side of the Andes, and on the Argentine side, drivers can glimpse 22,841-foot-high Mount Aconcagua, the tallest peak in the Western Hemisphere.Travel tip: Watch out for border crossing delays at the nearly two-mile-long tunnel in Christ the Redeemer International Pass, named for a four-ton statue placed there in 1904.Linking the Shenandoah Mountains of Virginia to the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina, the winding Blue Ridge Parkway unspools along ridgetops, into fertile valleys, and past the highest peak east of the Mississippi (Mount Mitchell).Though it’s possible to drive the traffic light–free road without stopping, farms, fields, and small towns offer plenty of diversions worth braking for. Travelers can climb Sharp Top Mountain, eat cornmeal cakes at the historic Mabry Mill, or listen to bluegrass music as they wander beneath the white oaks, red maples, mountain magnolias, black cherries, and tulip poplars at Flat Top Manor.Travel tip: Though many drive the parkway in fall for its dramatic foliage, the route inspires no less awe in other seasons—especially spring, when wild ginger, trout lily, and jack-in-the-pulpit wildflowers bloom.Spectacular fall foliage blankets the mountains as the Blue Ridge Parkway winds through North Carolina.For some 65 miles in the Bolivian highlands, little more than a lane separates drivers from skydivers. North Yungas Road—which includes a 25-mile pass marked with memorial crosses known as the Death Road—descends from the outskirts of La Paz to the subtropical town of Coroico.Though a safer, paved bypass of Death Road was recently completed, mountain bikers and drivers still dare the one-lane route through the pass of La Cumbre on a barren, 15,255-foot ridge.Travel tip: Driving on the right side is the norm in Bolivia, but travelers are advised to drive on the left on North Yungas, in order to better gauge the wheels’ distance from the edge of the road—which drops without a guardrail to the valleys below.In 1972, after centuries of isolation, the villagers of Guoliang decided to forge their own route through the remote Taihang Mountains in northeastern China. They had long relied on a steep mountain trail also known as a “heaven ladder.” Then 12 local men hand-carved a rough recess through the mountain over the course of six years, using only heavy hammers and steel drill rods. The Guoliang Tunnel Road (officially known as the Precipice Long Corridor) is just 19 feet wide and 13 feet high, with rough, open “windows” peering out over views of the gorge hundreds of feet below.Travel tip: This twisting tunnel’s rock walls are badly cracked, with chicken wire at the entrance. Drivers are wise to turn on their headlights and honk their horns as they pass through.Climbing nearly 3,000 feet in just under 30 miles, classic BMWs and roadsters whip around the curves of the Grossglockner High Alpine Road between the Austrian states of Salzburg and Carinthia. Overhead, griffon vultures and golden eagles circle the Alpine peaks, where rare ibex and pudgy marmots scurry among brown bears and wolves. The joyride delivers drivers to the wilds of Hohe Tauern National Park, the largest nature reserve in the Alps and a magnet for hikers and cyclists.Travel tip: The Grossglockner charges a toll (around €34.50, or $38). Between May and November, stop off at the Kaiser-Franz-Josefs-Höhe visitors center, where a funicular shuttles passengers to an overlook of the colossal Pasterze Glacier.The southwest corner of New Zealand’s South Island poses the best kind of driver’s dilemma: Do you zip down wide-open roads or take your time to enjoy the views?From Queenstown, follow state highways south along the shore of Lake Wakatipu to turn off on Milford Road (aka Highway 94). This scenic, high-altitude route curves northwards through rainforests and past the white-capped Ailsa Mountains before ending up at the mirror-like, tea-colored waters of Milford Sound, a marine reserve home to penguins, dolphins, and New Zealand fur seals.Travel tip: The Milford Road eventually meets the Avenue of the Disappearing Mountain, where an optical illusion makes the peak appear to shrink as people approach it. Drivers stop at Lake Gunn for a short nature loop.Why play a video game when you can drive through one? Guaranteed to get the kids off their screens, the roughly 30-mile ride through Badlands National Park transports travelers into an out-of-this-world landscape of twisted canyons, striped rock walls, native grasslands, and fantastic spires.Long ago bypassed by an interstate, the skinny, two-lane Historic Columbia River Highway has seen little change since its completion in 1922 as the United States’ first planned scenic roadway. The route winds above Oregon’s Columbia River Gorge, taking in six state parks, seven waterfalls, and—on clear days—views of five mountain peaks, including Mount St. Helens. Breathtaking in any season, the highway is especially picturesque in spring, when endemic wildflowers bloom, and winter, when waterfalls freeze and massive icicles hang from graceful arched bridges.Travel tip: At Crown Point, drivers stop at the Vista House, an elegant art nouveau observatory 733 feet above the Columbia River.Romania’s twisting, mile-high Transfăgărășan Road traces a north-south route between the country’s two highest peaks. Vlad the Impaler, the prince who inspired Bram Stoker’s Dracula, is perhaps the region’s greatest claim to fame, and tourists can stop at the ruins of 700-year-old Poenari Castle after a scenic drive past the Arges River, the crescent-shaped rim of Vidraru Dam, and the emerald Vidraru Lake. Stop off at the 20-story Bâlea Waterfall to catch a red cable car up to Bâlea Lake, with two year-round chalets and an ice hotel built from scratch each winter.Travel tip: As if crossing 27 bridges and aqueducts, navigating an unlit tunnel, and keeping an eye out for errant flocks of sheep in the road wasn’t challenging enough—treacherous weather conditions mean Transfăgărășan Road is only reliably open from late June through mid-October.Transfăgărășan Road snakes through the Transylvanian Alps, also called the Carpathian Mountains.Running 144 miles between Banff and Jasper National Parks, Icefields Parkway brings drivers into the imposing landscape of the Canadian Rockies. Keep your eyes peeled for sightings of bighorn sheep, caribou, moose, grizzlies, and black bears, though you won’t have to search hard to glimpse surreal, inverted landscapes in the parkway’s mirror-like glacial lakes.Travel tip: Traffic is usually light—unless there’s a bear on the side of the road.Morocco’s Atlas Mountain Road tests drivers’ mettle, with two narrow, guardrail-free lanes snaking around too many blind curves to count. The 116-mile route takes in the otherworldly landscapes visible from Tizi-n’Tichka Pass as the road climbs more than 6,000 feet from Marrakech through the High Atlas Mountains and back down to the desert oasis of Ouarzazate.Travel tip: Along the way, obstacles range from unpredictable surface conditions to goats, camels, and mules blocking the road.",

"Some historians believe Vlad the Impaler may have slept here.Dracula slept here. Or maybe not.Bran Castle perches dramatically on a hill in Transylvania, its burnt-orange-tiled turrets and steeples rising above a crown of trees in Romania’s Carpathian Mountains. Depending on what account you read, Vlad Tepes—aka Vlad the Impaler—may have spent a night or two in this 14th-century fortress as a prisoner, or he may have attacked it once.Suits of armor guard the walls of Bran Castle.Irish novelist Bram Stoker loosely based his fictional toothy vampire on this historical 15th-century prince, whose fondness for skewering enemies on stakes as a public warning earned him his nickname. Now visitors from all over the world descend on rural Transylvania for a chance to experience some of the eerie thrill of Stoker’s novel. Tour companies often book Bran Castle for Halloween parties, complete with “bloody” vodka shots and a DJ.Yet, Stoker never visited Transylvania, much less Bran Castle. So how did it come to be known as Dracula’s?“In the 1960s, when Romania was ruled by a communist government, its tourism czars decided it could be advantageous to market a place associated with Vlad Tepes," says local historian Nicolae Pepene. “They looked around at all of the available castles and decided that this castle at Bran, which guarded the one mountain pass running between Transylvania and Walachia, looked sufficiently Gothic.” (Bonus point: Poiana Brașov, a popular ski resort, is only eight miles away.)Start with an 11th-century medieval fortress nestled between the French regions of Bordeaux and Cognac. Add 22 rooms with silky walls, rich berry-hued drapery, white marble baths, and cornice canopies. Then decide between veal with caramelized chanterelles or Ballotine quail with reduced grape and shallot chutney from Chateau de Mirambeau's Michelin-starred restaurant.On a moonless fall night, the imposing castle may look like a lair for the Prince of Darkness, but in the daylight the place actually seems more fit for a queen. Which it once was. Queen Marie of Romania called the 57-room chateâu home from 1920 to 1938. Behind thick defensive walls, the castle reveals a maze of cozy rooms, nooks, and crannies; a balconied inner courtyard with a well; and even a secret stairway to a wood-paneled library.“Its solitude appealed to me,” the eccentric royal—a granddaughter of England’s Queen Victoria—said.Honestly, the scariest thing here are the kitschy Vlad souvenirs on sale at the foot of the castle: fanged beer steins, gory T-shirts, and bottles of Dracula’s Blood wine.“It doesn’t really matter that visitors to the castle have their minds full of the myth of Dracula or of tales of Queen Marie of Romania,” Pepene says. “In the end, they’ve traveled here to experience a fragment of those old times.”",

Perhaps it’s the thick fortress walls blocking out the world, or the moat, or the secret passageways. Perhaps it’s the glimpse into a more lavish, pampered life, the bird’s-eye perspective from a tall tower, or maybe the soul-boosting treat of an ayurvedic massage. Either way, a stay in a castle is guaranteed to make any trip more interesting. Here are 25 castle hotels you will want to call home for the night.",
"The sun breaks through the clouds at Moraine Lake in Banff National Park.Location: Alberta Date established: 1885 Size: 1,641,027 acres Annual visitors: 4 million Entrance fees: $9.80 per adult; 17 and under freeSimplicity marks the origin of Banff—Canada’s first national park. In 1883, on the slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, three railway workers discovered a natural hot spring, and from there the park was born. Nowadays, Banff is one of the world’s premier destinations, spanning a region of unparalleled majestic mountain scenery. Every year, millions of visitors make the pilgrimage to Banff to take in its stunning views and arsenal of activities. (Take a majestic mountain drive through Alberta.)Cave and Basin Hot Springs is now a national historic site that offers a high-definition movie, living history activities, a ranger-led biodiversity experience in the surrounding marshlands, and an evening lantern tour. It’s no longer possible to take a dip in the soothing waters, but just 10 minutes away is Banff Upper Hot Springs, a modern spa with outdoor pools, changing rooms, and a café.Banff village has evolved from a whistle-stop into a thriving year-round resort town with hotels, restaurants, art galleries, and outdoor adventure outfitters. Lodged inside a mock-Tudor building, Banff National Park Visitor Centre has everything you need to know about places, activities, road conditions, and weather in the park. (Find beauty and peace in Canada’s first national park.)Two blocks down the main street is the Banff Park Museum National Historic Site, which doubles as a rustic architectural wonder and storehouse of Victorian-era zoological, botanical, and geological specimens. The nearby Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies specializes in regional art and architecture, including paintings, sculptures, photography, and heritage homes on display in the gardens.Outdoor recreation of one sort or another surrounds the village. Laid out in 1911, the public nine-hole Banff Springs Golf Club takes full advantage of its location in the Rockies with epic mountain views and fairways along Bow River. Along the river’s north bank, the Banff Legacy Trail (16.65 miles) between Canmore town and Banff village is just one of the park’s many scenic cycling and mountain biking routes. Bow River between Lake Louise and Canmore offers plenty of scope for fly-fishing, self-guided kayaking, and guided float trips of the type offered by Rocky Mountain Raft Tours.Towering high above the village, Mount Norquay provides skiing, snowboarding, and tubing in winter; hiking and biking trails; a via ferrata rock climbing route; and chairlift flightseeing in summer. Just 20 minutes outside town is Lake Minnewanka, a long fjord-like body of water with plenty of options to get wet, including swimming, kayaking, fishing, motor boating, or even scuba diving the ruins of a sunken village. One-hour scenic boat tours cruise the lake to Devil’s Gap.An hour farther up the Bow River Valley via the Trans-Canada Highway is drop-dead-gorgeous Lake Louise. Named after Queen Victoria’s fourth daughter, the stunning alpine lake is a bit cold for swimming but ideal for paddle sports in summer or lake fishing and ice-skating come the winter freeze-over.Looming above the east shore is the historic Château Lake Louise, opened in 1911 and still Canada’s ideal national park lodge. Afternoon tea in the lounge—with huge picture windows overlooking the lake—is a long tradition. Of the area’s many hikes, Plain of the Six Glaciers Trail is the most popular, a (8.1 mile) round loop along the lakeshore and up a glacial valley, with a chance to sip at the log cabin Lake Agnes Tea House located on the mountainside.Brewster Stables organizes summer trail rides to the teahouse, as well as a full-day expedition ride up to Paradise Valley and winter horse-drawn sleigh rides around the shore. Another way to discover the lake area is by the private guided hikes offered by Great Divide Nature Interpretation. Themed treks revolve around glaciers, grizzlies, birding, autumn leaves, or dozens of other topics.Down in the village, Lake Louise Visitor Centre offers another chance to fetch information, brochures, maps, and books about the park. Clinging to the eastern side of the valley is Lake Louise Ski Resort, which sets itself apart from other winter sports resorts in the region with activities like Torchlight Dinner and Ski evenings, a spring music festival, guided snowshoe tours, and backcountry ski tours.Just north of Lake Louise, the Trans-Canada Highway veers off to the west and into British Columbia. But another famous roadway continues north along Bow River: the celebrated Icefields Parkway (Highway 93), which meanders 167 miles through the heart of the Canadian Rockies to Jasper. Flanked by rivers, waterfalls, snowy peaks, and more than a hundred glaciers, the route offers plenty of reasons to pull over, snap a photo, take a short walk, or simply take in views of nature’s splendid canvas.Bow Lake is a great place to pause, for a peek at historic Num-Ti-Jah Lodge or a hike along the Bow Glacier Falls Trail (5.78 miles round-trip) to the namesake cascade fed by meltwater from Wapta Glacier. The parkway reaches its highest point at Peyto Lake, with its jaw-dropping views back down the valley. Another waterfall tumbles through the slot canyon at Mistaya before the parkway leaps across the Saskatchewan River at a place called the Crossing, which marks the halfway point between Banff and Jasper villages. Fifty kilometers (30.1 miles) farther up the parkway is Columbia Icefield and the start of Jasper National Park.Get there: Banff National Park is located 80 miles west of Calgary. Calgary’s international airport is serviced by major national and international carriers with multiple flights arriving daily. From the airport, rent a car and take Trans-Canada 1 west from Calgary straight into the park, through Banff and Lake Louise. A direct bus service from the airport or downtown Calgary is also available to Banff and Lake Louise, as are shuttle services through tour operators.When to go: Open year-round, Banff offers amazing wildlife viewing and sightseeing, plus plentiful shopping and dining options, any time of the year. Summer is popular for hiking, paddling, mountain biking and cycling, photography, and climbing. The best time for viewing seasonal color is fall, when the larch trees—the only coniferous trees to lose their needles in winter—turn yellow.In winter, the mountain landscape makes for incredible downhill and cross-country skiing. In fact, three major downhill ski resorts operate within the park. Lake Louise Ski Resort, Sunshine Village, and Mount Norquay combine to offer a large skiable terrain, not to mention the backcountry trails available throughout the park. The ski season, which runs from November to May, is one of the longest in North America. Visitors can also enjoy wildlife tours, ice walks, snowshoeing, and dogsled and horse sleigh rides.Get around: Visiting the park by car or tour bus is most common. In the town of Banff you can also catch the ROAM bus, a publicly accessible and environmentally friendly hybrid outfitted with wildlife information. Pick up a map or bus schedule at the Banff or Lake Louise visitor information centers. GPS guides are also available.Where to stay: Iconic national park lodging at a classic location, Château Lake Louise offers restaurants, bars, a spa, and kids’ camp. Baker Creek Mountain Resort holds log cabins along the Bow River south of Lake Louise with bikes and fishing rods to rent. Banff Springs Hotel is a historic national park property founded in 1888.",
"Looking for the greatest mountain road trip in North America? Follow National Geographic travel writer Robert Reid who spent four-days on one of his favorite scenic driving tours in Alberta, Canada.Head to the Canadian Rockies where the ride from Calgary to Jasper is a 266-mile highlight reel of awe-inspiring mountain, glacier, and wildlife views. Allow ample time for unplanned breaks to check out the stunning landscapes, take photos, and embark on exhilarating outdoor adventures.West of Calgary via Highway 1A (a quainter splinter road of the Trans-Canadian Highway), Cochrane sits in the foothills—and wears the Wild West on its wrangled sleeves. Experience the town’s cowboy past at Alberta’s first large-scale ranch, the Cochrane Ranche Historic Site, which dates to 1881. There’s a picnic area with views of the Rockies’ skyline, so pack a lunch and enjoy the panorama.INSIDE TIP: “In town, the aptly named Rockyview Hotel is a Western-style hotel,” says Reid. “Its cowboy bar, known as The Texas Gate, has open mic sessions on Sunday afternoons.”Banff, a bustling mountain town hemmed in by peaks, is part of Banff National Park. Make the town your launch pad for outdoor adventure in the park. Conquer the vertigo-inducing ropes course at the Via Ferrata up Mount Norquay, a ski slope in winter. Hike some of the more than 1,000 miles of trails. Watch for free-roaming elk, grizzly bears and bighorn sheep. Soak in the soothing Banff Upper Hot Springs.INSIDE TIP: “One of Banff’s icons is the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, a castle-styled hotel that opened in 1888,” says Reid. “It’s set in an enviable spot amid a rising blanket of forest. Even if you don’t stay, you can wander the historic interiors with a map, hike the trails on the property, and have a drink at one of its many restaurants and bars.”Head northwest, beyond the hamlet of Lake Louise, through subalpine forests to the massive, cream-colored Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise Hotel—another castle-like icon. The hotel is nice for a drink or a meal, but the main draw is its backyard: one-and-a-half-mile-long Lake Louise, probably the most photographed lake in the world and a top spot for canoeing. Rent a red canoe in the morning to glide across the calm turquoise surface toward the glacier-clad Mount Victoria, elevation 11,365 feet. Look for grizzlies sometimes seen wandering on the shore or swimming across the lake.INSIDE TIP: “Afterward, hike the Lake Louise Lakeshore trail or hike up to the Lake Agnes Tea House, a rustic chalet that’s served tea and biscuits since 1905, from the Fairmont Chateau’s trailhead,” says Reid.Highway 93 (the Icefields Parkway) parallels the Continental Divide, passing a squadron of glaciers as it runs 143 miles through long, forested river valleys that rise and drop sharply in the mountains. Prepare to make sudden stops for jaw-dropping views on a drive recognized as one of the world’s most spectacular. One top photo stop is Peyto Lake, 28 miles north of Lake Louise. Walk a paved trail through the woods to see the lake, which gets its bright turquoise hue from glacial particles suspended in water. Farther north at Mistaya Canyon, a dirt trail reaches the narrow canyon where the river flow from Peyto Lake dips and gnarls through fissures of rock that often hide its depths.INSIDE TIP: “Because shops and cafés aren’t common along this stretch,” says Reid, “pack your lunch before setting out. Finding a picturesque picnic spot will not be a problem.”Before entering Jasper National Park, stop for gas and food at the Crossing Resort, located at Saskatchewan River Crossing. Add a scenic hike at nearby Parker Ridge. The 3.4-mile out-and-back hike climbs 820 feet and reveals views of hidden valleys unseen from the road below. Even in the summer certain areas are covered in snow, and some visitors slide down the hills on cardboard. The highway’s namesake—Columbia Icefield— becomes obvious farther north and feeds eight major glaciers. Explore Athabasca Glacier by all-terrain transporter, on foot, and via Glacier Skywalk on the ice-to-sky Glacier Adventure. Heading north, the road follows the Sunwapta River. Stop at impressive Sunwapta Falls and take the short (less than a mile) walk to the lower falls.INSIDE TIP: “Take alternate route Highway 93A to see the milky blue waters of the Athabasca Falls funneling into a chasm,” says Reid.Sunwapta Falls, Jasper National Park.Banff’s cousin city Jasper is a railroad town set within sight of four impressive mountain ranges. Small lakes—some, like Pyramid Lake, if you are up for a dip—dot the valley floor. Wilder adventure awaits on the Jasper SkyTram, a cable car that soars over the steep northern face of Whistlers Mountain. On the seven-minute glide up to the summit, soak in the 360-degree scenic views and watch for wildlife, such as such elk, bear, moose, and sheep. Book the Sunwapta Wild Water SkyTram Combo to ride the aerial tramway after taking an adrenaline-pumping rafting trip down the Sunwapta River.INSIDE TIP: “The visitors center [Jasper Information Centre National Historic Site] has an entertaining book of bear sightings to peruse,” says Reid.Southeast of Jasper, Maligne Canyon (via Trans-Canada 16 and Maligne Lake Road) is the most popular side attraction. The canyon cuts across forest floor as a deep, serpentine crack where the Maligne River slips, pools, swerves, and drops among potholes, hollows, and smooth overhanging walls of limestone. Stop to hike a bit on the brink of the canyon, then continue past Medicine Lake to glacier-fed Maligne Lake, the region’s largest natural lake at 13.7 miles in length.INSIDE TIP: “Book a boat cruise or rent a canoe to enjoy Maligne Lake’s massive beauty,” says Reid.Fly to Calgary and rent a car at the airport. Drive west on Highway 1A for 30 miles to the starting point in Cochrane. Continue west on Highway 1A for 90 miles to Banff, and then 36 miles northwest to Lake Louise. From here, drive north 144 miles on the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) to Jasper.Spend the first night in Banff, which offers a range of lodging options, such as cozy bed-and-breakfasts, off-the-grid backcountry lodges, and luxurious hotels. On night two in Lake Louise, splurge on the elegant Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise Hotel or bunk in an authentic log cabin or rustic lodge at Baker Creek Mountain Resort. End the drive at the majestic Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge. A Canadian Rockies’ institution, the luxury mountain resort on the shores of Beauvert Lake has welcomed guests since 1922.TRAVEL TIP: The best time to drive this mountainous route is June to September, however, it’s also the busiest travel season. Consider making the trip in late May or early October instead, and check local weather conditions before you go. For additional travel information, visit travelalberta.com.",
"During a family vacation last year, Sarah and Greg Newman took their kids to a butterfly garden in Wisconsin, where they learned about monarch butterflies, a vital but rapidly disappearing pollinator. They also learned about the garden’s monarch rearing program—known as the caterpillar lab—in which volunteers help caterpillars to grow, pupate, and emerge as butterflies.The monarch rearing program is one example of a rapidly growing effort around the world to encourage everyday volunteers to contribute to the scientific process, which is collectively known as citizen science (or, sometimes, community science). And because it requires no scientific background, the activity is a perfect way for kids to explore the world around them and contribute to efforts that can help protect the planet and make other discoveries.“Our kids, who are five and two, love all things nature,” says Sarah Newman, a research associate at Colorado State University and community engagement strategist at CitSci.org, a group that supports scientists who run these projects. “Apps like iNaturalist—or Seek, its kid-friendly offshoot—allow them to participate in the observation process.”Enlisting the help of kids is now easier than ever, thanks to developments in mobile technology and virtual communication over the past decade. The benefit of participation goes both ways, however. “There is a recognition among scientists about the value of crowdsourcing,” says Greg Newman, a research scientist at Colorado State University and the director of CitSci.org. “They recognize the power of the masses.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunities for participating in real-world science have exploded as virtual solutions to foster problem-solving and collaboration skills even though kids aren’t physically face-to-face. Rather than just learning about scientific methods in a virtual classroom, these projects are a hands-on way to physically explore and question the world around them and learn how science applies to real life.“The best way to learn is to be engaged in real-world problems and connected to your community, and the world beyond your community,” explains Mary Ford, director of professional learning at National Geographic Society and long-time citizen scientist. “Citizen science allows all of those things to happen naturally, organically—they are built into the process.”Early involvement in science can help children forge an identity as scientific thinkers, with long-lasting effects. Research suggests that children who participate in science at an early age are more likely to feel a sense of responsibility toward the environment and support scientific endeavors later in life. Similarly, positive exposure to the environment as a child creates positive attitudes toward the environment as an adult.This is true for Sarah Newman, who developed an early love for nature and later participated in a citizen science project in high school. “We tagged raccoons and followed them with radio telemetry,” she says. The project, which tracked the animals’ movements, taught her hands-on data-gathering skills—a formative experience that helped inspire her to pursue science as a career.Furthermore, engaging with these types of science-based projects is a great way for kids outside and moving. Time outdoors can reduce stress, build self-confidence, and promote creativity.The growth of citizen science makes it easier than ever to match a child’s interest to a project. Kids can send photographs of clouds to NASA through the GLOBE cloud program, participate in a local bioblitz, or identify plants and animals with the Seek app. And if your child seems more interested in video games than science experiments, websites like FoldIt use online puzzle-solving games to help scientists study different protein structures and their role in diseases like HIV, cancer, and Alzheimers.The key to success is figuring out what’s going to hold your child’s interest.“Think about how old your kid is and what their attention span is like,” Sarah Newman says. “Think about projects that fit their needs for time and energy.” Kids who are proficient in reading and writing will have more opportunities available, but younger children can still observe and help Mom and Dad as they participate in projects of their own.“It’s equally important to ask, what is a good citizen science activity for parents?” Greg Newman adds. “The activity needs to be compatible with your circumstances.” For the Newmans, they look for activities that move quickly and can be abandoned at any moment to accommodate their young kids.Safe and intuitive technology is also key. If you’re using electronic tools, like an app or website, parents should carefully review privacy controls to protect little ones before committing to the project.Finding the right projects for families can be as easy as perusing websites like CitSci.org or Citizenscience.org, which offer extensive project lists. SciStarter.org has a filter that allows users to sort by topic or age appropriateness. Parents can also talk with teachers or after-school programs to find local engagement opportunities. (National Geographic supports educators by providing citizen science teaching materials).Ford, who has worked in citizen science for over 20 years, says children tend to stick with it through competition and collaboration. Apps designed for kids are often gamified so that the user can collect rewards or digital badges that signify their accomplishments and help hold their attention.“When you’re working with a class or your family, kids like to compete to see who can get the most badges,” she says. “Knowing that your data helps solve a problem and gets combined with other people’s data to create a huge database—that’s really motivating for kids, too.”Another major incentive is finding something that truly impacts a kid’s life. A project measuring air quality from nearby traffic or cleaning up trash at the community beach can give them a sense of responsibility and agency on issues directly affecting their community. It’s also an opportunity for them to see how complex global issues—like climate change or plastic pollution—manifest at the local level.And obviously the child’s interests are also a crucial piece of the puzzle, Sarah Newman says. What do the kids do with their time? What do they like to learn about? “The benefit of discovery and the unknown is fun for all of us, no matter what age we are.”",
"Whether your children are more into Lewis and Clark or Luke Skywalker, they can learn important life skills from explorers. Observation, creativity, self-confidence, and curiosity are traits that all adventurers share. And getting your kid out into nature—whether as a daily boredom buster or part of a "staycation"—is a great way to foster these qualities for life. Here are 20 outdoor ideas to nurture your kid’s natural explorer.Be tree detectives. Have them observe and collect visual clues (so no tree is harmed) like leaf shape and size, bark color and texture, and whether the tree has flowers or cones. Then using an old-school tree field guide, let kids solve the mystery of what kind of tree it is. (Here's a kid-friendly guide for getting started.)Create a neighborhood map. Roll out a piece of butcher block paper so kids can draw in the trees, houses, yards with big dogs, and other landmarks they observe on expeditions (i.e. neighborhood walks). Mapmaking requires attention to detail and encourages kids to focus on what’s around them.Play nature bingo. Print out 25-space bingo cards to carry on hikes or walks. Pre-fill the blocks with natural stuff to look for like a spiderweb, jagged rock, and local birds. (Plastic flamingos don't count.)Choose a sit-spot. Pencil in a daily “sit-spot time,” a favorite practice among naturalists. Kids pick an outdoor site to sit, unplug, and tune in to nature for 20 minutes each day. Calm fidgety fingers with a notebook to write or draw observations.Focus on creature features. Whether it’s a squirrel’s bushy tail or a rabbit’s oversize feet, animals have signature physical characteristics that usually serve a purpose (as in, yikes, let me hop away from that predator real quick!). Researching why critters look and act the way they do gives kids more incentive to quietly observe wildlife.Design a wildlife-friendly garden. Who knows what will show up when you create a space where birds, butterflies, and other critters feel at home? Put kids in charge of choosing food sources (like feeders or nectar and seeds from native plants) and flora that provide safe places for hiding from predators and raising their young. (Here are kid-friendly instructions for getting started.)Point and click. One tap of the Seek app by iNaturalist gives kids (under your direct supervision) the power to identify plants and wildlife they’re curious about. Using a camera, image recognition technology, and lists of commonly seen wild things in your area, the app clues in curious explorers about what they’ve discovered. Families and kids 13 and older can earn badges by sharing observations online. (Get kid-friendly tips for taking photos outside.)Watch plants drink. Kids are always curious about how things work—and that includes plants. Stems are basically plant straws, so to see how they suck water from the soil, try this experiment: Add water and red food coloring to a glass jar, stick the stem end of a white carnation or daisy inside, and watch the thirsty flowers slowly turn pink from their drink.Take a virtual field trip. Broaden your kids’ horizons without ever leaving home by joining live broadcasts of the National Geographic Explorer Classroom. The free daily video events give kids the chance to see, talk to, and learn from real explorers around the world.Zoom in. Off-limit no-no’s like treetops and beehives can instill some not-so-acceptable behavior in children. Instead, focus that curiosity with lower-magnification binoculars (which are easier to hold steady and provide a wider field of view) to get a closer look at nature kids can’t or shouldn’t touch. Look for a pair with 8x magnification to make safer-at-a-distance nature appear eight times closer than with the naked eye.Take a night hike. When the sun powers down, nature’s spooky-cool night crew revs up. On an after-dark family walk, tread lightly, listen closely, and work together to identify sounds like owl calls and frog croaks. Wear headlamps to boost the adventure level (and stay safe) and spot nocturnal critters like opossums and raccoons.Walk the line. Elevate your kid’s view of nature—and their sense of what they can accomplish—by suspending a low-hanging slackline between two trees or other fixed objects. Walking a foot-high slackline requires balance and focus; falling off (a lot) and trying again builds the resilience kids need to step outside their comfort zones.Follow their lead. Explorers regularly face setbacks. The next time a downed tree blocks a hiking path, or a sudden closure shuts down a park, ask the kids for suggestions. Obviously you’ll make the final call, but encouraging kids to weigh in and share their reasoning helps them feel valued and capable.Go west! Or north, south, or east by teaching kids how to use a compass. The mnemonic “Never Eat Soggy Waffles” helps kids remember how the cardinal directions appear on the compass face. Take turns walking north to south using only the compass needle as a guide to help them feel confident that they’ll always know where they’re going. (Hint: The needle’s red end always points north.)Try something new in nature. Stand-up paddle boarding, spelunking, or even just handing over the hiking map opens up children to new experiences that make them feel adventurous and confident. Just for kicks and giggles, take a deep breath and see what new, possibly-scary activity your kid wants to tackle next!Create a backyard biodiversity guide. If an interplanetary traveler came for a visit, what living things would your kids want it to see? Make local biodiversity the theme and let kids use digital or old-school tools to document their recommendations.Curate a Small Stuff photo exhibit. Inspire creativity by inviting kids to photograph the little parts of nature, not the obvious whole (like a square of gnarly bark instead of the entire tree). Print and display the photos in a hallway gallery. Host an “opening” where budding photographers can talk about their work.Take a micro hike. A yard stick, magnifying glass, and creativity are the only tools kids need to shrink down to ant-size hikers. Using the stick to mark trail length and their imaginations to pretend they’re miniature, kids lie down and “hike” (slowly on their tiny ant legs), using the magnifier to make discoveries.If trees could talk … What would they say after standing in one place for 50 years or more? Have kids create these fanciful histories, or keep a week-by-week journal for a nearby tree so children can view the world from nature’s perspective. Add photos of memorable events the tree observed, like January’s blizzard or July’s backyard cookout.Play blindfolded. In a park or yard, have kids take turns as the guide and the blindfolded person. The guide verbally leads the other child through a series of nature exercises—such as circumnavigating a tree, smelling flowers, and waiting to hear a bird’s song. The guide gets creative with instructions, and the blindfolded kid gets creative with following them.",
"Playgrounds have become the new ghost towns.Throughout the country, most states plus the District of Columbia have issued “stay-at-home” orders for their residents, meaning that people should stay in their houses except for essential needs like going to the grocery store. Cities are shutting down parks, playgrounds, beaches, and other recreational areas. The CDC has even updated guidelines to recommend that everyone wear cloth masks while in public.Which begs the question: Are kids allowed to go outside anymore? And if they are, is it even safe?Absolutely. Thankfully, most of the stay-at-home orders consider getting outside for limited recreational time “essential.” And experts agree that as long as parents are vigilant about social distancing (maybe you’ve heard of it?), allowing kids to have outdoor time is nothing but healthy.“It’s also so important at a time like this,” says Claire McCarthy, a pediatrician with Boston Children’s Hospital. “Getting out makes us all feel less cooped up and scared.”We all just need to play it safe. Here’s how.Before you encase your child in plastic wrap and lock her inside forever, remember that getting kids outdoors is simply good for their health.According to Sarah Milligan Toffler, executive director of the Children and Nature Network, a growing body of research is showing that regularly interacting with nature improves brain function. Studies point to nature helping to reduce the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, serve as a buffer to depression and anxiety, prevent or reduce obesity and myopia, and boost the immune system.Outdoor play also helps children increase important motor skills. To write and draw, kids need to develop small hand muscles. “That’s what’s happens when they dig in the dirt,” says Christy Merrick, director of Natural Start Alliance in Washington, D.C., an organization that encourages outdoor experiences with children. “Safe tree climbing develops balance as well as the large muscles in arms and legs.” (Just make sure, she says, to stay close and let them climb to a height appropriate for their age and abilities.)Playing outside can even help children spur creativity skills, important for a developing brain. “It gives them a chance to pretend, make up games, and manage unstructured time,” McCarthy says.Information about the virus and how it spreads seems to change every day. That makes it confusing to know what to do to keep kids safe outside. Here’s what the experts are saying right now.Of course, this is always easier said than done, especially when you’re dealing with energetic children. If you don’t have a front or backyard, find a neighborhood athletic field or large grassy area where kids have plenty of space for distancing.No fields nearby? “As a family, you can go for walks, kick a ball, or ride bikes,” McCarthy says. “Just remember to be thoughtful and creative to maintain safe distances from others.”And what about those passersby who might not be paying attention on the sidewalk? It’s theoretically possible for a droplet to land on you if someone coughs as he passes. But it’s highly unlikely, McCarthy says. “It all depends on your position, the wind, if you’re in motion, and other physics,” she says. “However, the chances of catching something this way are pretty small. Keep your distance and be vigilant about the whereabouts of your children.”You can also create social distancing games to help children remember how to act.• Measure out six feet. Have your child count how many steps, hops, or jumps it takes to travel that far. Then when someone comes close, remind your child to take that many steps back.• Have kids pretend they have a six-foot-wide force field around them. Then remind them to activate it when they pass someone or see a friend.• Play “statue” in someone’s driveway to give others room to pass.Avoid monkey bars. That goes for slides, swings, and the rest of it. Because the virus might be able to live on hard surfaces for a few days, most experts recommend staying away from playgrounds, even if they’re open. “You have no way of knowing who or when the last person was on the play equipment or benches,” McCarthy says. “Be mindful that those things could have the virus on them.”Stick with your kids. This of course depends on the child’s age and maturity, but we can’t always trust excited tykes to follow the rules. “The safest approach is to be with them,” McCarthy says. “Children have a way of forgetting new rules and slipping back into old habits. Even when they’re riding bikes, they’ll end up next to each other. They want to talk or wait together to cross a street.”To mask or not to mask: On April 3, the CDC began recommending that people wear masks anytime they’re in public, especially in places where social distancing is difficult to maintain. That applies to children two years old and up. But they can still go out and play. McCarthy says she and her family are bringing masks along with them whenever they go outside. “You can quickly put on the masks if you are unable to keep a safe distance from other people.” (Here’s what you should know about DIY masks.)Seeing playgrounds shut down and not being allowed to hang out with friends can be upsetting to kids—and maybe a little scary. (Even adults are a bit spooked by the sudden appearance of face masks on neighbors.) It’s OK to be honest with your child about why these precautions are necessary.“Explain that right now a germ is spreading from one person to another and making some people very sick,” McCarthy says. “To keep everyone safe, we’re trying to stay away from other people so it can't spread.” (Here’s how to talk to your kids about coronavirus.)It’s also an opportunity to dispel some myths that might be noodling in your kid’s noggin. For instance, you can’t get the virus from someone from across the street. And just because a person coughs, it doesn’t mean that person has COVID-19.Now that children can’t rely on their friends to play outside, many parents are feeling pressure to stimulate that activity. “Parents worry they don’t have outside activities for their kids, but the reality is children naturally know how to play,” Merrick says.The key is to create opportunities for outdoor play. For instance, “turn walks into scavenger hunts,” Merrick says. “Look for colors and shapes in your neighborhood. Watch and listen for birds, insects, and other animals.”Here are some other ideas for creative outdoor play.• Look for found stuff in your yard or house that kids can stack, build, and sort, and let kids take the lead. Add some old dolls or action figures to inspire creative play, and carry the toys outside in a box or basket for easy cleanup.• Take a hula hoop outside. After your child’s done swirling, toss it on the grass or concrete. “Go on safari inside the hula hoop,” Merrick says. “Have your child report on what they find in the circle.” If you don’t have a hula hoop, use a jump rope or string, or even some sticks.• Make a yummy outdoor science experiment using the sun as an oven. For instance, let kids figure out how to make s’mores in the sun.• Sidewalk chalk art. Draw the entire family, including the pets. Trace shadows throughout the day to see how they move. Write greetings to people who might walk by later.• Have your child make a color wheel with markers or crayons. (If they’re younger, they can just scribble different colors on paper.) Then take it outside to find matching colors.• Select leaves and flower petals from your yard. Give children some paper and let them draw with the petals and leaves.• Need to tire kids out before a conference call? Have them set up an outdoor relay, backyard Olympics, obstacle course, or a dance party.• Challenge them to extend their outdoor play by seeing how many times they can toss a ball in the air or keep a game of toss going.• Don’t forget the classics, like four-square and hopscotch.",
"Right now, your kids probably aren’t exploring like they were a few months ago. So give them another option: Have them explore the world by making maps.Maps show more than how to get from Point A to Point B—they also tell a story. They can reveal the travel path of a bug, explore animal patterns in your neighborhood, or even envision a future world.Mapmaking keeps kids’ brains active by promoting language, geography, history, and art skills. Using a different perspective to think about people and places inspires creativity, and understanding spatial relationships increases reasoning skills important for STEM learning.And during this time of social distancing, maps might be more important than ever. “They can help kids discover other places and people,” says James Meacham, a cartographer and geographer with the University of Oregon. “Maps reinforce how we’re connected.”Here are some ideas for creating maps that will get your kid on a new path of exploration.The first step is figuring out what your child wants to map. Obviously, maps can be geographic, but they can also inspire different kinds of stories. These non-geographic maps show how things connect: your family tree, ingredients for a clown-faced cupcake, or the mid-air path of a paper airplane.Spark your children’s creative side by brainstorming ideas they want to express, from favorite animals to events to topics they want to explore. This will help them visualize and organize the ideas.Then have kids decide on three to five features the map should show. For instance, if the map tracks ants on the sidewalk, does it need every plant or just green to represent them? Does every ant need to be drawn, or just the trail they followed? Thinking about these things allows children to tell their story without feeling overwhelmed. “Some maps include more information than others,” says Joanna Merson, a cartographer who develops interactive online maps for UO InfoGraphics Lab in Eugene, Oregon. “It just depends on what the map is trying to convey.”Maps need data, whether it’s how to get from one place to another, personal observations, weather patterns, or fictional news about Bigfoot sightings on your block.Start by making a chart to gather or track information. “If your child is mapping backyard animals, note when and where they’re seen,” Merson says. Include observations about any patterns, such as if the animal is on the ground, hides in shadows, or makes noises in certain spots. Use that data to build the map.Martha Sharma, a geography consultant from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, suggests asking open-ended questions to help the child visualize the world or story, gather information, and express it on the map. “You might start the conversation with, Are there any rivers? Do all the people live in the city? Tell me about the monsters.” Open-ended questions often start with who, what, when, where, and why.If children are starting from scratch, they can start with simple stick-art doodles. But it’s not cheating to look at what’s been done for inspiration. “Cartographers often begin with an existing map and then adapt it to share the story their way,” Meacham says.Let the child’s imagination create the map. Whether it’s crayons or digital renderings, paper or cloth, photos or drawings … anything can make a map. (You can even create an “ancient” map by crumpling it up and dunking it in diluted tea—just make sure to test another piece of paper first.) “Children who prefer art might want to draw a chalk map on cement,” Sharma says. “A child who lives to build with Legos might prefer a map with precise measurements and many details.”And don’t sweat things like exact distances or legends—just focus on the fun. “Encourage creativity rather than precise mapmaking or textbook-inspired skills,” Sharma says.Need a creative idea for a map? One of these will surely inspire your kid.Track backyard or neighborhood wildlife. Map ants on the sidewalk, look for snail trails, or observe where squirrels move throughout the day or where dandelions grow. “This activity can also include their friends,” Sharma says. Kids can open a video chat to compare what they observed, and talk about the differences.Map from your dog’s perspective. Think about where it likes to walk, sleep, and pee; where its doggie friends live; how often it visits its food bowl; and other things a dog would care about. (Come up with a cat-friendly map as well!)Imagine a map. Friendly monsters in the neighborhood? Create a map based on made-up sightings of mythical creatures in your neighborhood.Make a friendship tree. This would include a kid’s BFFs, plus things like when and where they met, favorite moments, funny stories, and other connections.Solve a mystery. Check under the bed or couch cushions for something that doesn’t belong, like a penny or dirty sock. Map how it might have gotten there, thinking about everything from supply-chain trucks to the bottom of a shoe. Make the tale even more exciting by adding unlikely types of transportation along the way, such as space aliens or dinosaur delivery.Map for the future. Have kids think about what they want people a hundred years from now to know about, then create a map with key locations of things important to them: school, hangouts, BFFs’ homes, where something awesome happened, and other personal stories.Or maybe way in the future. Map your city—but what it’ll look like in 50, 100, or 1,000 years from now.Make mash-up maps. Put your favorite town locations in a book character’s neighborhood, on Mars, or in a famous place like ancient Egypt.Design an aspirational map. If your kids have a place they’ve always wanted to go, have them find out who lives there (people and animals), what food grows there, the weather, and other things that make this location special.",
"We know. The phrase “flower pressing” likely conjures up visions of great-great-grandparents making a display to put next to a side-table doily. But these days, sometimes old-school is the way to go.Gathering flowers gets kids outside and fosters exploration; arranging and pressing the blooms encourages curiosity and creativity. Plus, children just might learn a little about botanical and environmental sciences.Convinced yet? Here’s how to bring some flower power into your family’s life.Wherever you search for flowers—your yard, a field, your neighbor’s lawn (with permission, of course)—look for thin, small, easy-to-press flowers like daisies, cosmos, poppies, or petunias. Thicker flowers like roses are harder to flatten and more likely to mold. Don’t overlook dandelions, white clover, or other flowers often considered weeds. Kids love them, they’re easy to find, and they press well.A nice goal is no more than 12 flowers—that way they won’t take up too much space in your home while they press. But consider visiting a few different spots and picking two or three at each location. That helps protect habitats for bees, birds, and other animals, and the remaining plants will continue to produce fruit and reseed. (Parental win: You’ve just taught your kids about biodiversity.) Make sure to follow state or local laws for picking wildflowers.Avoid rainy days, early mornings, or right after sprinkler time, as petals are prone to mold when a flower’s wet. Look for blooms with brightly colored petals rather than browning ones. (Once flowers start to wither, the colors aren’t as vivid.) Cut the stems with child-safe scissors; adults can use pruning shears.Watch out for prickly or poisonous plants like poison oak and poison ivy. Kids should also be mindful of wildlife that might live on or eat plants—no need to disturb helpful ladybugs or potentially stinging bees.Pressing flowers is as easy as, well, opening and closing a book. The only supplies you’ll need are a large, heavy book; six paper towels; and either newspaper or parchment paper.Place the newspaper or parchment paper on the right page of the open book. Place two or three layers of paper towels on top of the newspaper or parchment paper.Place a flower on top the paper towels and arrange it so everything faces out, meaning nothing is folded on top of itself. If the stem is flexible, add curves to make it look more interesting. Delicate petals or leaves can be arranged with tweezers or a toothpick.Once the flower is arranged, carefully cover it with two or three additional layers of paper towels. Use tweezers or a cotton swab to hold the flower face in position as you set down the towels. Gently press and hold the flower in place as you add the same amount of parchment or newspaper on top that was used on the bottom. Then carefully close the book.Pile books on top of this book, and let the stack sit for a week or two. This is when the science happens: As the flower dries, the paper towels help absorb the moisture from the plant and prevent it from decaying. The dried petals, stem, and leaves retain most of the flower’s pigments, or the substances that produce color.Once the flower feels completely dry, carefully remove it from the press with tweezers.Now what? Pressed flowers glued onto paper and put in a frame make great art, but here are some other ideas to help your kid’s creativity bloom.Stained glass flower. Create a stained-glass effect by painting white liquid school glue onto two pieces of wax paper. Place the pressed flower on the painted side of one of the pieces; place the other piece painted-side down onto the flower. Gently press out any air bubbles. After it dries, make a frame out of card stock and hang it in a window.Souvenir book. Collect flowers on vacations or special nature walks to put in a memory book. Note the kind of flower and where it was picked, add photos taken on the walk, and write down other details about the day.Be a scientist. Record when, where, and how the flower was collected. Add its scientific name and the GPS coordinates of its location.Petal postcards. Scan pressed flowers, print them on card stock, then mail the creations to friends and family. (Check out other ideas for DIY postcards.)Personal stationery. Arrange and paste pressed flowers in a corner or around the edges of a sheet of paper. Then scan or photocopy it onto rice or parchment paper.Botanist bookmark. Place pressed flowers onto card stock or paper, then cover it with clear packing tape. Punch a hole at the top and thread yarn through it to make a tassel.Repurposed flowers. Use petals to create mosaic art. For example, dandelions can become a lion’s mane; overlapping purple flower petals can stand in as feathers.",
"This could be your kid imagining himself on a future vacation postcard.A canceled family vacation or a compromise of grandma's house instead of a crowded amusement park might yield a pout, a couple of eyerolls, or maybe even a few stomps. That’s understandable. Fortunately, there’s an old-fashioned way for kids to keep their travel dreams alive—writing postcards.“Dreaming, planning, being curious, and imagining themselves in the future helps kids feel energized and excited when they’re struggling,” say Sarah Sumners, associate director of the Torrance Center for Creativity and Talent Development. “We see psychological benefits in terms of both mood and behavior when kids engage in things like creative writing and creative thinking.”Kids didn't quite get what they wanted out of their vacation? They can pretend they did instead, creating postcards that share cool facts about places they wish they could visit and fictional accounts of the experiences they envision themselves having.“Just knowing that there’s a larger world out there, even if you can’t get to it right now, is definitely helpful for children,” says Amanda Moreno, associate professor and director of the child development program at Erikson Institute. “When you imagine, you can project yourself out of circumstances you’re currently in. This is good for both the heart and mind because when you expand your world, you see more possibilities, which means more hope and optimism.”Postcards tap into kids’ excitement and anticipation of getting mail, and are a great way to introduce them to the joys of letter writing. “There’s something special about sending somebody something, waiting to hear when they got it, and waiting for that response back,” Moreno says. “I definitely think the more modes of connection kids have right now, the better. It’s a really nice idea to supplement those screen-based connections.”Begin by having your kids brainstorm destinations. These can be places your family has gone in the past, locations you’ve talked about traveling to in the future, or even bucket-list spots you and your children dream of visiting.Next, do some research. The internet abounds with kid-friendly resources that include everything from country guides to podcasts to virtual tours they can use to learn about the history, geography, and culture of places they’d like to travel. (If your child is under 13, make sure you monitor their searches on not-just-for-kid sites.) Encourage your child to investigate the neighborhoods, landmarks, activities, and attractions for which a destination may be famous. Are there museums to visit? Beautiful beaches? Trails to hike? What kinds of animals might they encounter? What kind of food might they eat? All of this information will provide them with juicy fodder to use when designing and writing their postcards later.You’ll also want to gather some craft supplies. Have your kids raid the recycling bin. Postcards, which should be no more than 4 ¼ by 6 inches, can be made from paperboard—like cereal and granola bar boxes—as well as any kind of cardboard packaging. Options for decorating the fronts of cards are endless. Print out images found online or photos from previous vacations. Cut words and pictures from old magazines and catalogs to use in collages. Construction paper, decoupage glue, stickers, and glue sticks are other good things to have on hand. And don’t forget stamps!Finally, compile a list of potential recipients. Grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, teachers, and neighbors are all good options. You might want to reach out to these people in advance and ask them to write back in a similarly creative fashion. Or talk to the parents of one of your kid’s friends and arrange for the kids to write postcards back and forth. You may end up with a budding deltiologist! (That’s a person whose hobby is collecting postcards.)Here are seven ideas for different types of postcards kids can make, along with some writing prompts to spark their creativity.The staycation. Have kids create a postcard that tells what it’s been like to be home during a vacation. Describe something fun—or not so fun—that’s happened in that time: a backyard campout or a failed cooking experiment perhaps.Tourist in your own town. Let children think about what it’d be like to be a tourist on vacation in their hometown. Are there state parks nearby to explore? Historic sites? Museums? A beach? What are some of their favorite restaurants?Take a virtual trip. Museums, zoos, national parks, famous landmarks, theme parks, and even entire cities have developed online tours that allow families to visit from home. Join one of these tours and make a postcard that tells the story.Your dream vacation. Where would your kids go if they could go anywhere in the world? Do some research. How would they get there? Where would they stay? What people might they meet? What kinds of things might you do? Write a postcard describing one day of that dream trip.Literary travel. Have kids think about visiting the settings in some of their favorite books. If they’re a Stuart Little fan, they could explore Central Park. Loved Dumpling Days? Write about having an adventure in Taiwan. Another idea is to write a postcard from the perspective of a character in the book. If Hermione sent a postcard to her parents describing her first visit to Hogsmeade, what would she have told them?Guess the location. Here’s an idea for a postcard and game in one. For the front of the postcard, find an image of an iconic landmark like the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, the Statue of Liberty, or the Grand Canyon. Enlarge the image so that the front of the postcard features just one abstract part of the landmark—a corner of the Statue of Liberty’s crown, for instance. In the postcard, offer clues about the location. The recipient has to guess the place.Off the beaten path. Why send a postcard from Rome with the same old pictures of the Colosseum or the Sistine Chapel when you can tell the story of a less-touristy location? Have kids choose a destination and research a place that most people wouldn’t know about—a hidden neighborhood, a tiny museum, a store that sells handmade wooden toys—and write about the visit.",
"“Are postcards obsolete?” asked a recent article in the Washington Post Travel section. Well, it depends on who’s answering.I’ve been collecting postcards since I was a little kid—keepsakes from my own travels as well as postcards friends and relatives have sent me. In fact, they’re the only thing I collect—aside from half-used hotel toiletries—when I’m on the road. That makes me, I found out, a deltiologist.I file the postcards more or less alphabetically by state and country in a sturdy green plastic carrying case that used to hold collectible wildlife cards that I would get every month in the mail as a grade schooler.Leafing through my collection, I tab past a postcard of Krakow, Poland, to one from Pennsylvania’s Omni Bedford Springs Resort. I have a postcard dated 1979 showing the scene inside an Atlantic City casino from a family friend (“Please send money immediately. Ha! Ha! Arm is very tired.”) and one from Grenada that I picked up last September.Yet even I have to admit I rarely send postcards anymore when I travel, much less receive any.I still buy them for my collection, if I can find them, but mailing one in an actual post office? It’s easier to upload a pic on Facebook.The Post reported that sales of postcard stamps in the United States have declined significantly; the U.S. Postal Service processed 770 million stamped postcards in 2014, down from 1.2 billion in 2010 (though those numbers are likely skewed by promotional postcards).The fate of the postcard is also suggested when visiting the places that used to sell them. And where they are still to be found, the variety of the cards on offer seems to be taking a nosedive.All signs point to the imminent death of this iconic form of correspondence.But a recent visit to Washington’s Sackler Gallery gave me reason for hope.A section of “The Traveler’s Eye” exhibit featured vintage dispatches from the turn of the 20th century to the 1920s—the golden age of postcards.I was intrigued to learn that postcards have served multiple purposes, beyond being pretty souvenirs, over time. Tinted scenes showing exotic, nonthreatening—and newly French—Algeria helped market the country to prospective European settlers. An onboard scene with Mount Fuji in the background advertised the S.S. Mongolia cruise ship.There were postcards in the exhibition depicting a camel caravan in Iraq, a jinrikisha driver in China, a man being carried in a sedan chair in India. “It’s amazing how many postcards dealt with modes of travel,” Sackler curator Nancy Micklewright told me.Others were particularly poignant in light of contemporary events, bearing witness to places and things that no longer exist or are in danger of being destroyed, like the citadel in Aleppo, Syria.Across oceans and decades, postcards have proven more often than not to be as relevant now as when they were first dropped in the mail.They’ve also been consistent sources of elation and wonder at the world throughout time. Who doesn’t smile when they receive a postcard in the mail, especially in this day and age?It may be easier to upload a pic on Facebook. But, as Nancy Pope, a senior curator at the National Postal Museum who still sends postcards to friends and family with enthusiasm, notes: “It’s not the thing that you pull out of your mailbox and pin to the wall.”Maybe postcards aren’t on their way out. I sure hope not. In fact, I’m resolving here and now to rekindle the childlike joy in sending and receiving postcards by paying it forward myself.Mail us a postcard from your travels or even from your hometown for a chance to be featured in National Geographic Traveler magazine or online.Include your full name and where you live in your note, along with a short paragraph about what makes wherever you are unique. The more specific (and surprising), the better!Finally, use hashtag #postcardproject to spread the word or to share your postcard on Twitter and Instagram!National Geographic Travelerc/o Amy Alipio1145 17th St NWWashington DC 20036.Amy Alipio is features editor at National Geographic Traveler magazine.

"Whether photographing loved ones, family pets, or strangers, thinking ahead is key to capturing the personality, emotion, or character of the subject you are photographing. Be sure to practice social distancing and follow local ordinances when heading out for a photo shoot.Even if your vacation is going to be more of a "staycation," your family can still use the same skills that National Geographic photographers use to explore and document your backyard, home, or even just the bedroom.Being in the right place at the right time and having close-up access to your family is what home photography is all about. Plus, familiar places can seem as exotic as a deep jungle or lofty peak when you see it with fresh eyes, which is what professional photographers do every moment they’re on the job. “What seems utterly ordinary to you is in fact a slice of the cultural life of your world,” Nat Geo photographer Catherine Karnow says.You don’t need anything more than a camera phone to get started. Then have kids think carefully about what each member of your family likes to do. Does someone obsess over puzzles? Bake bread? Dance like a K-pop star?After all, these intimate moments won’t last forever. Use the following photo tips from Nat Geo experts to seize the opportunities now—and employ them in the future when we can once again explore farther afield.Challenge your kids to shoot a variety of images. Capture the landscape of your garden but also an architectural detail like the handrail on a staircase. Make a portrait of a family member sitting still, but also take a picture of that same person engaging in an activity, like putting away dishes or riding a bike. And shoot at different times of the day: early morning, midday, dusk. The resulting gallery creates a cohesive and rich portrait of your neighborhood or home life.Cloudy day? Don’t put away the camera. “Instead of wishing for a sunny day and ‘beautiful weather,’ notice how elements like mist and fog can be effective in conveying emotion, especially nostalgia,” Karnow says.And if it’s raining? No problem. Just wait until it’s over, then head outside. “Look around for a puddle of water. Get down low to the surface of the water (like a couple of inches) and you'll suddenly have wonderful reflections to work with,” Nat Geo photographer Jim Richardson says.Zeroing in on one distinguishing feature of the pet can have a big impact.When it comes to super-active kids or pets, advise children to be patient and pay attention to their subjects. “They often have moments when they stop moving for a second or two. Often they’ll do it again,” Richardson says. “Learn their tells and you can be ready when the next moment of stillness happens.” When photographing a pet, get close, get low, and keep the background simple. (Get kid-friendly tips for capturing the perfect pet portrait.)The best light for shooting is early in the morning and late in the day.Ever notice how a room looks different early in the morning when the sun is coming up? And how the light coming in from the window shines in a special way right before the sun sets? “We call that time ‘golden hour’ because the sun at that angle makes everything look more golden,” says Nat Geo Travel photo editor Maura Friedman. That’s a great time for kids to explore the house and neighborhood with a camera—even if it means getting up a bit earlier than usual or moving dinnertime.When photographing babies, look for close-up details. Experiment and fill the frame with a hand, a foot, or a tuft of hair.You don’t need a flash to get a great picture of a family member. You can rely on natural light alone if you position your subject near a window. Curtains can work to soften the sunlight.Advise kids to look for telling details about their subjects. Does a sibling play the piano? Focus on her hands. Or does she participate in marathons? Look at her feet. The abstraction says something about the individual. Also look for close-up details when photographing babies. Experiment and fill the frame with a hand, a foot, or a tuft of hair.If you’re photographing a group, shoot several frames to make sure you get an image in which no one’s eyes are closed.Being in the right place at the right time and having close-up, intimate access to your family is what home photography is all about.“Put your camera in some unique location that will give you a new, novel, useful, or intriguing viewpoint,” Richardson suggests. Have kids search out a high spot such as a balcony, tree branch, or stairway. They also might get an intriguing image by simply holding their cameras over their heads. (This is called the “Hail Mary” shot and is often used by news photographers trying to get a shot above the heads of a crowd.)Alternatively, get the camera on the ground, angle it up a bit, and shoot away. Or get beneath things and look up, whether that’s under a table or a bed of flowers.Make the moon look extra cool by photographing it behind an object near the horizon.Keep an eye out for things to shoot when evening comes on. Everyone loves to watch a sunset, but when photographing one, “it isn’t enough to get a great sky,” Karnow says. “You have to have an element in the shot that will provide both interest and a sense of place.”And next time there’s a full moon, have kids head out to document the moment. (Get kid-friendly tips for photographing the moon.) But don’t use the zoom on the camera, which will decrease quality. “Take the image first, then zoom in to crop or enlarge detail,” Nat Geo photographer Michael Christopher Brown says. “Ideally the phone is stabilized,” he says, because when shooting something so far away, tiny vibrations of the camera can dramatically reduce image quality. If no tripod is available, even placing the phone on a solid surface like a ledge or windowsill will ensure a stable exposure.",
"Every day, the average American teen with a TikTok account spends 82 minutes scrolling through videos. If they love animals, they may find their feed filling up with a stream of irresistible critters doing irresistibly cute things—from puppies, rabbits, cats to slow lorises, monkeys, chimpanzees, and tigers.After all, who doesn’t love a cute video of a domestic cat pouncing on its owner’s head? But animal-loving young people can also inadvertently get served a regular stream of problematic wildlife content without even realizing it.Hands-on exotic wildlife videos on platforms like TikTok and YouTube are hugely popular and may seem innocuous. But they’re part of a spectrum of online content depicting animal exploitation both explicit—platforms have become hot spots for for the illegal wildlife trade—and implicit, in the form of photos and videos that normalize keeping exotic wild animals as pets and props.TikTok has recently taken a stance on explicit exploitation. In March, the platform followed Facebook, Instagram, and others in joining the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online. The coalition’s stated goal is to reduce the illegal trade of wild animals and their parts on the internet by implementing policies to better detect wildlife sales online. Since the coalition’s 2018 launch, platforms have removed at least four million trafficking posts. Still, it’s impossible to quantify how or if that has made a dent in the online trade. Sellers will routinely open new accounts and are adept at finding new ways to evade detection, National Geographic reported in December 2020.Yet TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms still permit other types of questionable exotic wildlife content—and that’s what kids are most likely to view. It’s people showing off the exotic pets they own, or hugging sloths, or riding elephants on vacation. It’s roadside zoo owners wrestling adult tigers. It is, in short, content that doesn’t appear to depict animal exploitation but perpetuates perceptions that can harm wildlife—or obscures welfare issues behind the scenes.Siobhan Speiran, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies at Queen’s University in Ontario who has spent the last three years researching social media’s influence on people’s perceptions of wild animals, describes this as “covert exploitation.” But once kids understand how harmful that can be to animals, the more empowered they’ll become to protect them.“The best way to connect with kids is to connect with the fact that they already care about animals,” says Meira Geyser, who’s received more than 400,000 likes on her TikTok videos advocating for animals. “They have that innate compassion.”Here’s how parents can be aware of concerning content their children may inadvertently encounter, and how they can talk with kids about making online platforms safer for animals.Seemingly harmless videos of people interacting with wild animals are deceptive because they appeal to those who love animals. And some of the most popular exotic animal content comes from roadside zoo or pseudo-sanctuary owners. (Roadside zoos and pseudo-sanctuaries are loose terms that describe unaccredited facilities with low, or at least problematic, standards of operation and care and often offer hands-on interactions with animals and breed extensively. These zoos differ from zoos accredited in the U.S. by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which requires facilities to go above and beyond basic animal health and welfare requirements set by the government. And according to the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, a true sanctuary does not breed or allow hands-on interactions with animals.)For instance, Bhargivan “Doc” Antle and his son, Kody—featured in the hit Netflix docuseries Tiger King— routinely post videos of themselves walking, play-fighting, and bottle-feeding tigers, white lions, and chimpanzees at their roadside zoo, Myrtle Beach Safari. Doc Antle has 2.1 million followers on TikTok; Kody has a staggering 24 million. Both are verified by the platform.But the short, playful videos mask serious animal welfare concerns. Last October, Virginia prosecutors indicted Doc Antle on 15 charges of wildlife trafficking and animal cruelty, alleging conduct that caused “torture or unnecessary suffering” to lion cubs.Animals are also put at risk when roadside zoos offer up babies for petting—images of which will likely induce squeals in kids. But animal welfare concerns at these types of places have been well documented. (This guide provides tips on how to do wildlife tourism right on your next family vacation.)For instance, many private facilities speed-breed their tigers, keeping adult female tigers almost constantly pregnant and taking their cubs as soon as they’re born. Once cubs reach 12 weeks old, they’re too dangerous to interact with visitors. They may become breeders themselves or go on exhibit—and there’s evidence that some are killed. Many roadside zoo owners fail to provide adequate food, enclosures, or veterinary care.Kids might also engage with content creators who own exotic animals and call them pets—big cats, slow lorises, monkeys, exotic reptiles, and more. The U.S. is the world’s largest importer of wild animals—nearly 3.2 billion were imported into the country between 2000 and 2014. More than half were taken directly from the wild, and almost all were likely destined for the pet trade. Although much of the exotic pet trade is legal in the U.S., transport can be incredibly stressful, and many animals suffer in captive environments, unable to eat, sleep, or move as they would in their wild habitats.So though children might be captivated by what appears to be a cute video or photo, they’re not seeing the cycle of suffering an animal might be going through. And a growing body of evidence suggests adorable videos of animals on social media fuels demand. In 2015, for example, a flurry of cute YouTube videos of slow lorises eating rice balls highlighted how social media fuels trade in the creatures, depleting their populations in the wild and putting individual animals at risk of mistreatment.Speiran says the images also normalize hands-on interaction, portraying wild animals as tame and enjoying the experiences. This may in turn fuel demand for hands-on tourist experiences or exotic pet ownership.“It’s an erasure of their wildness, agency, and independence,” she says.Kids likely won’t understand that watching a cute video of someone hugging a full-grown lion is harmful to the animal, so don’t make them feel like they’ve done something wrong. Instead, help them think critically about what the animal might be going through.Speiran says the concept of consent is taught to children from an early age these days, and it’s a great jumping-off point for thinking about wild animals’ autonomy. “Emphasize empathizing with animals,” she says.So for instance, if your kids see a video of a tiger and owner looking happy as they play in a pool together, Speiran suggests having them consider these questions:“Where do you think the tiger came from? Where is this tiger’s family?” This could be an entry point to talk about issues with irresponsible captive breeding in roadside zoos, poaching, or animal trafficking.“Do you think this could be dangerous?” This can get kids thinking about how big cats—even if they’ve been hand-raised—are still genetically wild and can turn on a human in an instant. (Read more about a jaguar in a roadside zoo that attacked a visitor in a hands-on encounter last year.) It can also be an opportunity to discuss how hands-on encounters can spread zoonotic diseases between wild animals and people. (Read this story about “Tiger King Park” reopening for cub-petting at the height of the pandemic, after several documented U.S. cases of humans passing COVID-19 to big cats.)“Imagine if you were adopted by a family of tigers. Would you have some good days, too?” This a great way to help kids understand that just because an animal might seem happy in a video, they’re seeing only a curated sliver of the animal’s life—a 15-second video that the owner has filmed and uploaded.“Could your adopted family of tigers give you everything you need?” This helps kids put themselves in the animals’ shoes (or paws) and think about what the critter might be missing by not living in the wild—or in a suitable habitat with an accredited zoo or sanctuary, with companions of its own species.Another idea, especially when talking about selfie content with wild animals, is to get kids to think of their own pets, Speiran says. “Would your cat or dog enjoy being passed around to strangers for eight hours a day?”Once kids seem to have a good grasp on how to evaluate captive wildlife videos, help them filter out problematic content in their feeds and discourage them from engaging with similar content their friends might be viewing. Replace those accounts with things like NGOs; wildlife biologists; legitimate, hands-off sanctuaries and animal rescue organizations; and accredited zoos ( ... and National Geographic!). Curating their feed to be more animal-friendly will help expose them to regular educational content and filter out what they don’t want.That might help empower kids to take more active steps to educate others—and potentially push platforms to take a stand against it. Children may even be interested in creating videos of their own, educating their peers on issues facing wildlife.“There’s a lot of power in the voice of young people,” says Giavanna Grein, senior program officer at TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring group that co-leads the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online. “Users continuing to stand up against this content and say they don’t want it on social media platforms—that they themselves won’t participate in these activities—can go a long way.”",
"Illegal ivory from elephants, rhinos, and other animals is in demand for the production of carved sculptures, trinkets, and jewelry such as these pieces, destroyed in Hong Kong in May 2014 as a public display of defiance against wildlife trafficking. Scientists studying the online ivory trade have found that sellers often use code words to avoid detection by law enforcement.When a squad of federal and state law enforcement agents with guns and bulletproof vests entered a single-story brick home in Buffalo, New York, on July 5, 2018 they were searching for business records of a suspected criminal enterprise.Experts trained to handle dangerous exotic cats congregated in a sunroom pungent with the odor of cat urine. Wearing blue latex gloves, the wildlife handlers carefully collected two young caracals distinguished by their long, black-tipped ear tufts; four juvenile servals, copper-colored with handsome black spots; and an adult savannah cat, a cross between a serval and a house cat. The homeowner, Christopher Casacci, 38, a short man with buzz-cut black hair, watched as the handlers hauled the cats away in plastic carriers to a truck outside, protesting that the savannah cat, named Tigger, was his family’s pet.Casacci, who was running the website ExoticCubs.com, is now facing 33 charges related to trafficking protected African cats for the exotic pet trade, including disguising illicit activity by falsely declaring some of the animals as domesticated breeds, and violating a federal animal welfare law.The unauthorized trade in protected wildlife not only violates landmark U.S. environmental laws but also the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)—a global agreement that seeks to ensure that trade in wildlife and plants doesn’t threaten their survival.If convicted, Casacci could face as much as $1.3 million in fines and up to life in prison, according to federal attorneys prosecuting the case.This is not Casacci’s only run-in with the law. Previously, he served five years on probation for felony forgery of drivers’ licenses that he was selling online, complete with scannable barcodes and ultraviolet watermarks.Native to Southeast Asia, the helmeted hornbill has a solid "horn," or casque, made of keratin, which can be carved into jewelry and intricate objects. Authorities first became aware of large-scale trafficking about eight years ago. A 2019 study by the conservation nonprofit Traffic reported nearly 550 hornbill parts and products for sale on Thai social media in a five-year span.His attorneys, James Grable, Jr., and Nicholas Romano, declined to make him available for an interview for this story but provided a statement saying that Casacci, who was then 21 at the time, and therefore much more mature now, “admitted this was wrong, accepted responsibility for his conduct, and received a sentence of probation,” which he served.In May 2020, Casacci made the news again. Federal agents searched his Sunbeam Laboratory facility, in Lockport, New York, which made hemp products before the COVID-19 pandemic, when he retrofitted his operations to mass manufacture hand sanitizer. The authorities allegedly seized more than 22,000 mislabeled and substandard KN95 masks and a thousand unauthorized COVID-19 test kits imported from China. No charges have been filed in relation to the alleged seizures. The company has denied wrongdoing.In their statements relating to Casacci’s cat trafficking case, his attorneys called him a “lifelong animal lover” and “not a poacher, trafficker, or abuser of animals.” They say that he embarked on his exotic cat business as an effort to rescue African kittens and place them in sanctuaries. According to them, “Casacci made every effort to follow the law and the guidance given to him by state and federal governmental officials, and as a result Mr. Casacci maintains that he is not guilty.”Casacci may have caught law enforcement’s attention, but countless other online wildlife dealers continue to operate in plain view, experts say, because of a law that protects online companies from being accountable for illegal activity on their platforms.The internet is now a global bazaar for the multibillion-dollar black market for exotic pets and animal parts, used for everything from curios and medicines to leather boots and skin rugs.“We have a dizzying array of platforms where all kinds of trade is going on, often with the illegal masquerading as legal,” says Craig Tabor, former special agent in charge of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s intelligence unit, now serving as the agency’s international attaché in Gabon.“Criminals in the U.S. can communicate with people in China, Tanzania, and Indonesia in real time, and anonymously,” he says. “They’ll use any platform available, and they will adjust their methods to evade detection, like switching terminologies and using code words.”Crime watch groups have focused heavily on Facebook, with 2.6 billion monthly users in dozens of countries and an expanding portfolio of former competitors, including Instagram and WhatsApp. (The purchase of those companies prompted federal regulators in early December 2020 to accuse Facebook of illegally crushing rivals to monopolize social media. Facebook is pushing back on the allegations, saying the government “cleared the acquisitions years ago” and now “wants a do-over,” according to reporting by CNN Business.)Facebook says it’s cracking down on wildlife trafficking by working with conservation groups to remove endangered animal postings. But some online crime experts say such policies of removing illicit wildlife for sale may be doing more harm than good. They say it prematurely alerts criminals that they’ve been spotted, creating a game of whack-a-mole in which traffickers open new accounts under different user names. And they assert that it deletes public evidence that could help authorities catch traffickers.Facebook may be acting with good intentions. But even if that’s the case, a number of groups, including the nonprofit Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO) and the National Whistleblower Center, a nonprofit that supports people who expose illicit activity, are calling for broader measures to combat cyber wildlife trafficking.A new report by ACCO found that the number of Facebook pages and groups devoted to the trade in endangered species and their parts has grown since the company pledged to halt such sales in 2018.The finding parallels other recent research showing widespread illegal wildlife trading on Facebook, including a study by the World Wildlife Fund reporting that during the five-month period ending in May 2020, researchers counted more than 2,000 wild animals from 94 species for sale on Facebook from Myanmar alone.The ACCO investigators searched Facebook for 17 common word combinations associated with the illicit wildlife trade, such as “rhino horn for sale,” in four languages: English, Arabic, Indonesian, and Vietnamese. They found that more than half the 473 pages and 281 groups (representing nearly 1.5 million users) identified as selling endangered wildlife were created during the past two years.A Facebook spokesperson did not respond to questions about the allegations made by ACCO or other groups but provided a statement about the company’s policies: “We prohibit ads and content attempting to trade, sell or purchase endangered animals, and remove content that violates our policies when we’re made aware. In addition to proactive detection, and partnerships with wildlife experts, we progressively work to improve our enforcement of our policies and respond to valid requests from law enforcement when they are made.”In addition, the spokesperson said there is a new feature being launched on the company’s platform this month that will inform users about the illegal trade when certain wildlife-related search words are entered. “For example, if a user were to search for a protected species combined with a commercial activity such as ‘tiger + buy,’ an alert would pop up to declare that animal abuse and the sale of endangered animals or their parts is not allowed on Facebook.”Facebook’s dominance over the internet constantly grows as the company’s algorithms make recommendations to connect users with people and groups who reflect similar interests.“That matching is scary when people are trading illicit goods,” says Gretchen Peters, founder of ACCO, which works to fight organized crime networks trafficking everything from guns, drugs, and people to tarantulas, parrots, rhino horn, and human body parts. “If it’s illegal to do something in real life, it should be illegal to host it online,” she says.“Governments need to enact legislation that compels social media firms to modify their algorithms to [better] detect illegal activity instead of facilitating it,” says Dan Stiles, a Kenya-based illegal wildlife trade investigator working with ACCO. “Facebook and other technology firms are sophisticated and rake in billions in annual revenue. They’re more than capable of combating the crime on their platforms, but there’s nothing in the law that requires them to do so. That needs to change.”To that end, the ACCO and the National Whistleblower Center favor changing a 1996 law that exempts tech companies from legal responsibility for many crimes committed using their platforms. They’re also promoting passage of a new wildlife conservation and anti-trafficking law, now in the U.S. Congress, that would provide the ability for any person anywhere in the world—including employees of big tech companies—to anonymously and confidentially report animal trafficking and be rewarded financially for doing so.The groups say that making companies more accountable for criminal activities on their platforms will require them to work more closely and cooperatively with law enforcement. Then, instead of catching one wildlife trafficker at a time, they can shut down entire criminal networks operating on the internet.Casacci is the only person indicted so far in relation to his online exotic cat business, according to federal attorneys. Court documents allege that he launched ExoticCubs.com about three years ago, advertising serval and caracal kittens imported from South Africa for $7,500 and $10,000 respectively. The full-grown, 20- to 50-pound felines make “excellent pets,” the website stated.In addition, it said, exotic cats can be trained to use the toilet, and it advised not to mistake the caracal’s hiss for aggression—it’s their “version of meow.” Kittens were available, the website said, for curbside pickup at Buffalo International Airport, or Casacci would drive them to within a several-hour radius of the city. He also advertised that he offered rescue services for unwanted large felines, including cheetahs, tigers, lions, panthers, and jaguars.Between January and June 2018, Casacci imported 30 African wild cats, including 18 caracals and 12 servals, from a captive breeder in South Africa, according to court documents. Federal authorities claim that he violated the Lacey Act, which bans the illegal trade of wildlife and plants, and animal welfare laws.A grand jury indicted him with selling 17 of the cats to buyers around the country, with falsely labeling four of them as domestic hybrids, and with 15 counts of inhumane treatment of animals. Five cats are unaccounted for in public records. ExoticCubs.com has gone dark, but photos of cats for sale that Casacci posted in 2018 are still accessible on social media.In the print media world, if a newspaper runs a libelous story about someone, that person can sue the outlet. But they can’t sue the newsstand or coffee shop that sold the paper. If they could, few businesses would ever risk selling newspapers, especially those that run stories critical of individuals or detail malfeasance.Similarly, an “interactive computer service,” according to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, can’t be “treated as the publisher or speaker of any information” provided by an outside party. So if someone defames a former partner or sells illegal goods on Facebook, that person, not Facebook, is held responsible.Upon passage of the bill, one of its sponsors, Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, described Section 230 as providing a “sword and a shield.” The sword would enable technology firms to self-police content on their platforms as they saw fit. The shield would provide sweeping immunity from liability for content posted by third parties.“As it turned out,” Stiles says, “the sword was made of rubber, while the shield was Teflon.” Stiles is among the many critics who say tech companies are abusing the shield.The companies are fighting mounting efforts by legislators to reform the safe-harbor protections of Section 230, arguing that their self-policing of content such as illicit sales of wildlife and wildlife products, guns, drugs, and humans is effective.Since 2018, more than 30 international tech, e-commerce, and social media companies have joined with conservation groups to form the Global Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online. Members include Facebook, eBay, Google, Twitter, and WeChat owner Tencent. The coalition is led by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Traffic (a wildlife trade monitoring group), and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.The goal: To reduce cyber wildlife trafficking by 80 percent by the end of this year. Peters and other experts, however, question the very premise of that goal, saying it’s impossible to quantify wildlife trafficking online because deals are so often made in secret.The coalition’s most recent progress report shows that as of March 2020 more than three million endangered species listings have been removed from the internet as a result of companies sharing data with wildlife experts, enhanced algorithms, monitoring of key word searches, and intelligence sent through volunteer citizen “cyber spotters.”Emilie Van der Henst, a wildlife trafficking project manager with WWF and Traffic in Brussels, Belgium, praises Facebook in particular for removing suspicious content. “They have taken a large step by saying they ban all animal trade unless it comes from a qualified merchant,” Van der Henst says. “As soon as we find [animal] listings, it takes a maximum of two weeks for Facebook to take them down.”But others say that closing accounts and deleting posts does more harm than good. “Taking down accounts is absurd because the criminals just create new accounts,” says Stephen Kohn, an attorney with the National Whistleblower Center. What’s more, he says, deleting accounts may erase crucial evidence that could be used to find and prosecute criminals. “They’ve essentially told the trafficker that they’ve been spotted, so now they can go into hiding. How nice to be a criminal, and every time I’m about to get caught, a big company warns me, then scrubs all the [public] evidence.”The law enforcement authorities I spoke with did not want to go on the record about how Facebook works with them on their investigations. They did say it’s helpful when tech companies alert them when there’s illicit trading going on and make evidence available when requested.In response to the Whistleblower Center’s accusations, a Facebook spokesperson referenced the company’s operational guidelines for law enforcement indicating that it has the right to disclose account records when provided with a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or national security provision.Patricia Tricorache, a Mexico City-based independent wildlife detective, who tracks criminals selling cheetahs online and works with the ACCO, says alerting tech companies about trafficking on their sites has derailed some of her investigations. It’s her impression that “if you report it, they either ignore you, or they remove everything,” she says. “Then I lose the guy, and he just opens another account with a different username.”At present, Tricorache is following about 550 online accounts, 80 percent of them on Instagram, that “together have offered well over 2,000 cheetahs for sale in the last 10 years.” (Scientists estimate that there are only about 7,100 wild cheetahs left worldwide.)The National Whistleblower Center claims, according to a complaint provided confidentially to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017, that Facebook is facilitating illegal activity on its platform, making money through advertisements generated by algorithms, and not disclosing the risk of such conduct to company shareholders—in violation of SEC regulations.“In all its required SEC filings and communications with shareholders and potential investors since its initial public offering on May 18, 2012,” the complaint states, “Facebook has violated numerous securities laws and regulations by failing to disclose the revenue it has derived from and the massive risks it faces because of rampant illegal trafficking it has allowed to occur on its products.”In collecting evidence to support their claim, the Whistleblower Center got some help from two anonymous former law enforcement agents who logged onto Facebook and created phony profiles representing themselves as ivory dealers. After dressing up their profiles with photographs from safari trips to make them look like authentic ivory traders, they sent friend requests to suspected wildlife traffickers in Vietnam, a major hub of the illegal trade. Then they joined Facebook groups where those individuals were active. Since they didn’t speak Vietnamese, they used Google translate to type words such as ngà voi and sừng tê giác, ivory and rhino horns.Before long, the former agents had infiltrated a network of hundreds of ivory traffickers eager to buy their merchandise. As they fielded messages from customers such as a user in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, who wrote, “Hello I want buy ivory of you.” They also took screenshots of products offered for sale on Facebook, from elephant ivory bracelets and rings trimmed in 14-karat gold to intricate happy buddha ivory carvings, whole rhino horns, and tiger fang pendants.Many of the postings were adjacent to auto-generated advertisements for a wide range of multinational companies, including fast food chains, major league sports teams, auto sellers, airlines, technology corporations, shoe brands, retail stores, and military equipment.“It would have been difficult for Congress to fathom how far the internet would evolve over the 20 years since Section 230 was enacted,” reads the complaint, “and nearly impossible for it to imagine that a company such as Facebook would be worth billions of dollars, with nearly all its revenue coming from advertisements, a good portion of which appear directly alongside illegal trafficking content.”Kohn says he was shocked when he first realized the “massive amounts of illegal activity happening on Facebook” and how much the company must be benefiting financially. “It’s unbelievable,” he says. “How can a publicly traded multibillion-dollar corporation for which investors are making billions of profits be so deeply involved in illegal wildlife?”The SEC declined to comment on the whistleblower complaint.A Facebook spokesperson responding to questions about the whistleblower charges reiterated the company’s policies and participation in the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online to prohibit content attempting to trade endangered species.The recent report by the Alliance to Counter Crime Online concludes that Facebook “is not just failing at removing wildlife sale pages and groups, it’s succeeding—massively—at pointing users in their direction,” illustrated by the finding that nearly 30 percent of the pages that they found trading wildlife were located through the platform’s “related pages” feature, which uses algorithms to recommend pages similar to ones that users have visited or liked in the past.Facebook did not respond to requests for comment about the ACCO report, other than to provide a statement on the company’s policies.Peters says it’s her impression that the nonprofits steering the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online are “bending over backwards to paint the program as a success when it’s been anything but that.”Sorcha, a caracal confiscated from Christopher Casacci’s home in Buffalo, New York, on July 5, 2018, now lives in Safe Haven Wildlife Sanctuary, in Imlay, Nevada. She and and three other cats seized from Casacci share a 5,000-square-foot enclosure with multilevel climbing platforms and a heated den for winter. Government authorities allege the cats were illegally possessed and sold in violation of state and federal wildlife laws. A federal judge in Buffalo, New York, is now considering evidence in the case.Leaders of the coalition did not agree to be interviewed about such accusations. Instead, they provided a statement summarizing the coalition’s goals, including “to harmonize prohibited wildlife policies, train staff to better detect illegal wildlife products, enhance automated detection filters, and empower users to be a part of the solution.” Among the victories cited was Facebook’s 2019 decision to ban trade in all live animals except those from verified sellers and all products from the most endangered species of animals and plants.A report released in July 2020 by Traffic counts more than a dozen emerging tools for spotting illegal species for sale online. Using the same image recognition technology that identifies your photograph in a friend’s Facebook post, the programs search platforms for pictures of threatened species.One such tool is software called ChimpFace being developed by Conservation X Labs, a Washington, D.C.-based company focused on wildlife preservation. It uses hundreds to thousands of photos of individual chimps with different face angles and in varied lighting to train the algorithm to recognize them. The more photos are uploaded, the more accurate the algorithm.“It has huge potential,” says ape trafficking investigator Stiles. “ChimpFace can match chimp faces within a probability of more than 90 percent, but the app still needs to be perfected before it’s ready for use by law enforcement.” And even then, he says, tech companies will need to agree to use it.David Roberts is a wildlife trade expert at the University of Kent, in Canterbury, England, who worked with a colleague to create an automated data mining system capable of detecting raw ivory for sale on eBay based on distinctive cross-hatchings known as Schreger lines. Roberts says the tool has an accuracy rate of 93 percent.His investigations have revealed that most wildlife traffickers don’t hide their criminal activity on the so-called dark web, networks that require special software or authorization to access, or use the obvious ivory search terms. That’s why visual detection tools like the one he developed can be a major asset. Roberts says that when he shared the algorithm research with the company, “initial interest” quickly fizzled.An eBay spokesperson responded to questions about why the company did not adopt the technology by lauding eBay’s proprietary wildlife trafficking detection system. “In 2017-2019 alone we removed or blocked over 265,000 listings for items prohibited under our animal products policy,” she said.In 2016, the National Whistleblower Center created an award-winning online platform that enables people around the world to anonymously file reports of wildlife crimes to authorities and qualify for financial rewards if their information contributes to successful prosecutions. Now the organization is advocating for passage of the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act, which would strengthen enforcement by establishing wildlife violations as offenses under federal racketeering and anti-organized crime laws and would provide financial incentives and protections for whistleblowers.Kohn’s hope is that if the act is passed (in combination with reform of Section 230), Facebook employees encouraged by the opportunity to receive a financial reward for credible intelligence exposing wrongdoing will become anonymous whistleblowers.While judges, lawyers, and legislators are weighing whether to change landmark laws and enact new ones, wildlife detectives are spending long hours lit by the glow of their computer screens as they follow the endless labyrinth of links from one suspicious post to another. Tricorache says that sometimes dealers masquerade as conservation organizations or animal rescue operations in attempts to navigate around laws and permitting requirements.In fact, Casacci’s claim of being a humane society was what caught the eye of law enforcement in the first place.In early June 2018 Birgit Hutchcroft, a licensed exotic cat breeder in Tampa, Florida, was scrutinizing the terms of a deal with Casacci to buy two caracal cubs for $11,000. New York State, where Casacci lives, bans breeding and dealing wild cats (except hybrids that are at least four generations removed from the wild), considering them a danger to people and native wildlife. When Hutchcroft asked him about this, he sought to reassure her, she says, telling her that exotic cat sales are legal if the business is incorporated humane society: “As we place cats in shelters, we are covered under that aspect of the law,” he wrote in an email included among the court documents.Hutchcroft forwarded the email to a contact at the USDA, asking if he could check Casacci’s license. “Just not sure if his credentials are sufficient,” Hutchcroft wrote. “Having second thoughts.”In fact, Casacci’s license application to possess African cats had been denied in November 2017. Casacci withdrew an application with the USDA before it was complete, according to an email between two agency officials.The agency dispatched an inspector, and when she arrived at his house on June 22, 2018, she found eight caracal and serval kittens in the sunroom and a “very strong odor distinctly different from the normal smells of this species,” according to her report. One serval kitten in a crate appeared lethargic, with watery eyes and diarrhea. She recommended that it be taken to a veterinarian as soon as possible. She also noted that the animal and another serval, both between nine and eleven weeks old, were so thin that they had protruding hip bones, concave abdomens, and palpable ribs, likely from malnutrition.By the time authorities searched Casacci’s home almost two weeks later, two emaciated serval kittens had died of sepsis, according to the Cornell University necropsy report.In a statement, Casacci’s attorneys say that “all of the kittens in his care were provided proper nutrition. Upon their arrival from South Africa, however, a small number suffered from undiagnosed health issues which Chris attempted to identify and treat with a veterinarian. It is important to note that the government has not charged Mr. Casacci with abusing or neglecting any animal, and has not charged him related to the condition of the animals in his care.”Wildlife experts with the nonprofit group World Animal Protection and two private rescue organizations agreed to provide homes for the remaining six kittens and Tigger the savannah cat.Tanya Smith, president and co-founder of Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, helped with the rescue at Casacci’s house. She took Tigger and the two smallest servals, now known as Sammy and Enzo, to her sanctuary. The servals were in bad shape, she says. “They had metabolic bone disease from poor nutrition, low blood calcium, parasites, ringworm, giardia, and coccidiosis. They were just barely alive, and we were really concerned that they wouldn’t make it.”Lynda Sugasa, Founder of Safe Haven Wildlife Sanctuary, in Imlay, Nevada, took the remaining cats there. Servals Reina and Goya and caracals Hantara and Sorcha now live together in a 5,000-square-foot enclosure with heated dens for winter, multilevel climbing platforms, pools, and trees. “It’s nice to see them under the foliage grooming each other,” Sugasa says. But, she adds, they’re anything but domestic. “These are wild animals. They’ll always have those instinctual behaviors to bite and scratch. You can’t tame them.”Sagasa and Smith are promoting the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which lists more restrictions on the possession and exhibition of exotic cats, including no direct contact with the public.If Casacci is convicted, it will be a victory for authorities tracking alleged online wildlife traffickers. As of this writing, evidence of Casacci’s cat business is still visible on Instagram. Sandwiched between videos of him skydiving from helicopters and driving a red Tesla, more than a dozen 2018 posts show exotic kittens for sale. Some commenters gushed, “I want one!” Others queried: “How much?”",
"Sales of tiger cubs and other wildlife and wildlife products, including ivory, pangolin scales, and red and pink corals, are increasingly occurring online, where anonymity facilitates the illegal trade.The black market trade in ivory and rhino horn doesn’t just happen in the back rooms of stores or under the table at nondescript secret meeting locations. Increasingly the illegal wildlife trade has moved online, where anonymity and the sheer number of for-sale postings makes it hard to stop the smuggling. When one company cracks down, sellers simply move to another platform.A new international effort aims to put a stop to this whack-a-mole effect. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare are launching the Global Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online, bringing together technology, e-commerce, and social media companies to work together to squeeze out wildlife traffickers. The coalition includes Google, eBay, Facebook, Instagram, and many others.“Criminal groups and illegal traders are exploiting the technology to operate anonymously online with less chance of detection and to reach a wider market than ever before,” says Crawford Allan, the senior director of wildlife crime at the World Wildlife Fund and TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring organization. Law enforcement can’t police it all, he says. “The companies themselves were the obvious answer. If the companies can take down the ads before they’re even posted, we’re in good shape.”Demand for illegal products such as rhino horn, which is often carved into artworks, is pushing many species to the brink.The illegal wildlife trade is pushing many species toward extinction, facilitated by online transactions. Savanna elephant numbers plummeted 30 percent between 2007 and 2014 because of poaching for ivory, which is turned into statuettes, chopsticks, jewelry, and more. The number of rhinos killed illegally for their horns in 2017—more than a thousand in South Africa alone—is a sharp increase from the 13 killed in 2007. Rhino horn is carved into libation bowls and trinkets and is used in traditional medicine. Countless other animals and their parts are also bought and sold online illegally every day—everything from sea turtle shell hair combs to the skins of endangered animals to rare live reptiles and tiger cubs. (Related: Instagram Fights Animal Abuse With New Alert System.)Internet giants have been under pressure for years to keep ivory off their platforms. The international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, but some countries, such as Japan and until last year, China, continue to allow registered, legally obtained ivory to be bought and sold domestically.But if you’re a potential buyer looking at an ad for ivory chopsticks online, how can you—or the company, or law enforcement—tell if they’re really legal? And even when a company bans ads for a particular product, like ivory, sellers simply come up with a code word.The companies in the coalition will address these problems in multiple ways, tailored for their specific platforms, says Giavanna Grein, a program officer for wildlife crime at TRAFFIC and WWF. The starting point is algorithms that use machine learning to detect keywords and flag posts before they even go up.But that alone isn’t a full solution, Allan says. There will always be a need for manual review, especially on social media sites. WWF is helping train companies’ teams to evaluate posts individually.Elephant ivory is one of the most common illegal wildlife products for sale online.“Another thing is getting users to become the eyes and ears of the company,” Allan says. These would be “wildlife crime cyber-spotters who can report anything to the company that slipped through the automatic filters.”Companies will be sharing knowledge about trends and best practices to develop priorities and to prevent loopholes from popping up on different sites, Grein says.Allan and Grein say they’ve been impressed at these companies’ willingness to participate.“It’s their duty to do the right thing, but the way that the web is evolving, it’s very hard for everybody to keep up,” Allan says. “For them to take a stand on this, when they could take a stand on thousands of other issues, it’s heartwarming to see. The way the companies have embraced it has really been an eye-opener.”The founding coalition are Alibaba, Baidu, Baixing, eBay, Etsy, Facebook, Google, Huaxia Collection, Instagram, Kuaishou, Mall for Africa, Microsoft, Pinterest, Qyer, Ruby Lane, Shengshi Collection, Tencent, Wen Wan Tian Xia, Zhongyikupai, Zhuanzhuan, and 58 Group.",
"Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, posing with tigers at his Myrtle Beach Safari zoo in 2018, has been charged with wildlife trafficking and animal cruelty in a case involving lions.The owner of a popular private zoo in South Carolina who was featured in the television series Tiger King has been indicted in Virginia on 15 charges that include wildlife trafficking and animal cruelty related to his activity with lions.Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, who owns Myrtle Beach Safari, was the prominent face of an attraction that touted cub-petting of tigers long before Joseph Maldonado-Passage, or “Joe Exotic,” gained notoriety earlier this year for his starring role in the Netflix docu-tainment series Tiger King. Antle’s 37-year-old facility, which he runs with three girlfriends and his children, has long been popular with celebrities seeking to cuddle tiger cubs. He and his children have millions of followers on TikTok and Instagram.On October 8, the Virginia Attorney General’s office charged Antle with one felony count of wildlife trafficking, one felony count of conspiracy to traffic wildlife, four misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to violate the Endangered Species Act, and nine misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty.The charges stem from a months-long investigation into illegal selling and transport of lions between Antle and Keith Wilson, owner of Wilson’s Wild Animal Park in Winchester, Virginia. Wilson has been indicted on identical charges to Antle, plus four additional counts of conspiracy. (Wilson already was facing 46 counts of animal cruelty in relation to a November 2019 raid that resulted in authorities confiscating 119 of his animals.)It’s illegal to sell lions—protected species under the Endangered Species Act—across state lines.Two of Antle’s daughters also have been indicted on misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals and violating the Endangered Species Act. Antle, Myrtle Beach Safari, and Wilson did not respond to requests for comment.Tiger King star “Joe Exotic,” meanwhile, is serving 22 years in prison for conspiracy to murder and killing tigers. Other private zoo owners who appeared in Tiger King have faced charges as well: Jeff Lowe lost his license to exhibit animals to the public, and Tim Stark was convicted of animal cruelty and violating the Endangered Species Act (and arrested yesterday for allegedly trying to conceal animals from federal authorities after weeks on the run).Tiger King became a pop culture sensation when it was released during the early days of the pandemic lockdown in March, but critics point out that it glosses over the realities of “roadside” zoos—many of which speed-breed tigers so tourists have cubs to cuddle, and frequently fail to provide adequate food, enclosures, and veterinary care.“It does bring full circle everything we saw in Tiger King,” says Dan Ashe, CEO of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits more than 200 zoos in the United States—but not cub-petting attractions like Antle’s. “What pretty clearly looked like awful operations [on the show] in fact is true. One by one, we’ve seen Tiger King stars—Tim Stark, Jeff Lowe, and now Doc Antle—be exposed for mistreatment of animals.” (Ashe is also the former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which enforces wildlife trafficking laws.)Antle’s social media videos show him and his family swimming with tigers and playing with chimpanzees. They stand in stark contrast to cruelty charges in the indictment, three of which allege that he willfully perpetuated cruelty toward lion cubs in July and August 2019 that produced “torture or unnecessary suffering.”Antle poses with his tigers and staff (left to right), Kody Antle, Moksha Bybee, and China York, in a pool at Myrtle Beach Safari in 2018. The Antles frequently share videos of themselves swimming with tigers and playing with baby chimpanzees on Instagram and TikTok, where they have millions of followers.The case was investigated by the Virginia attorney general’s Animal Law Unit, the first state attorney general unit in the country dedicated to investigating animal welfare and abuse cases. To date, the unit has handled 1,714 animal matters, including prosections, trainings, and consultations. “When I created the...Animal Law Unit in 2015 I couldn’t have imagined the results the team would have,” Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said in an emailed statement to National Geographic.“It’s been a shining example of what law enforcement should be doing to protect animals,” says Delcianna Winders, director of the Animal Law Litigation Clinic at Lewis & Clark Law School, in Portland, Oregon. She notes that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal agency tasked with enforcing the Animal Welfare Act, gave Antle’s Myrtle Beach Safari a clean inspection report both the month before and the month after state authorities searched it in December 2019 as part of this investigation to obtain evidence used for its indictment of Antle.It’s rare for states to investigate and prosecute animal trafficking cases, she says, and even rarer to follow them out of state, as Virginia officials did by tying Wilson’s activities in Virginia to Antle’s in South Carolina.But Virginia jurisdiction is limited to in-state activities. It’s up to South Carolina authorities to pursue further investigations into Antle’s Myrtle Beach operation, and federal authorities to pursue investigations into violations of the Animal Welfare Act and federal wildlife trafficking laws.Antle runs a foundation called the Rare Species Fund, which purports to raise money for wild tiger conservation. He recently announced plans to star in a new reality show, with the goal of changing how he’s publicly perceived. He told People magazine last week that there is a “false analysis that there are tigers in America that are in desperate need of help when the wild tiger is the one that really needs to be saved.” (Read more: There are more tigers in captivity in the U.S. than in the wild.)Ashe says investigations into such roadside attractions are vital.“The reason they exist is because people go to them,” he says, noting that there are plenty of accredited zoos in the U.S. for those seeking to view animals. Referring to a mantra he used at the Fish and Wildlife Service while working to stop travelers from buying trafficked animal souvenirs, he said: “Be informed, buy informed.”",
"Two tigers are pictured at Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in September 2018. In August 2020, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors documented poor care of tigers, wolves, bears, and other animals at the facility and suspended owner Jeff Lowe’s license to exhibit animals to the public.Editor's Note: On May 20, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it has seized all 68 big cats and one jaguar from Jeff and Lauren Lowe’s Tiger King Park. The big cats include protected tigers, lions, tiger-lion hybrids.Jeff Lowe, owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, in Oklahoma, posted a photo of lion cub Nala to Instagram in August 2019. “How many likes can our little cutie Nala get?” the caption said.She got 199.Ten months after Lowe introduced Nala on social media, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspector Bonnie Boone found her lying in mud, “lethargic, depressed and thin.” Boone and colleague Debbie Cunningham were conducting a routine inspection of the zoo, which exploded in popularity after it was featured in Netflix’s Tiger King. The young lion was barely moving and had discharge coming from her eyes and nose, Boone wrote in the inspection report. Her breathing was shallow and rapid. Boone demanded that Nala see a veterinarian immediately.Boone and Cunningham also documented two arthritic wolves caged on a concrete floor, a grizzly bear with her bones clearly visible beneath her skin, a fisher cat with a lame leg, and the bodies of two tigers buried under a pile of burned rubble. The corpses were attracting biting flies that inflicted bloody wounds on the ears of nearby tigers, bears, and wolves.On August 17, the USDA suspended Lowe’s license to exhibit animals to the public, as part of an official enforcement action against him and his wife, Lauren Lowe, for allegedly violating the Animal Welfare Act.Animal welfare advocates praised the action. “In terms of tiger exploitation, Lowe is one of the top players,” says Delcianna Winders, director of the Animal Law Litigation Clinic, at Lewis & Clark Law School, in Portland, Oregon. “He’s one of the leading reasons we’re continuing to have tigers bred” for roadside zoos around the U.S. (Read more: Captive tigers in the U.S. outnumber those in the wild—here’s why it’s a problem.)Lowe, right, points to Nala, a one-year-old lion, as she’s taken to see a veterinarian during a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection of the Greater Wynnewood zoo on June 22. Inspectors wrote in their report that Nala was “lethargic, depressed, and thin” and “would not get up out of the mud...even after prompting.”Nala was found with flystrike on her ear, a condition caused when fly eggs laid on an animal’s body hatch into flesh-eating maggots. Inspectors documented finding flystrike on several animals at the zoo on June 22, and linked the flies to a decaying tiger corpse on the property.Jeff Lowe declined to comment on the USDA’s suspension of his license, saying by email, “We’re suing the USDA so we can’t share anything at this time.” He has told his 189,000 Facebook followers that the findings are false and that the welfare concerns are drama stirred up, in his words, by “loony” animal rights people.The USDA “has folded to the pressures from PETA and continue to make false accusations against me,” he wrote in an August 18 Facebook post. Lowe describes the USDA’s accusations as “a litany of falsehoods.”In response to the suspension, which was set to last for 21 days, Lowe announced in the post that he was forfeiting his license. Typically, this would mean the end of his business—there’s little point in keeping animals that don’t return a profit on their upkeep costs. But Lowe says he has a new plan. It’s one that legal experts and even the USDA say might be in violation of the law: He’ll continue to make money off his animals by showing them to the public—but the business will be online and on television instead of in person at his zoo.After closing Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park to the public, on October 5, Lowe moved all the animals to a new facility, Tiger King Park, in Thackerville, Oklahoma. (The Greater Wynnewood property had already been set to be relinquished to Big Cat Rescue, a sanctuary organization based in Florida, as the result of a separate court case in June tied to its former owner, Joseph Maldonado-Passage.) Lowe said he intends to use Tiger King Park as a private film set for “Tiger King-related content.” He’s promised two upcoming reality shows and continues to feature animals in paid “shout-out” videos on the social platform Cameo.With this move, Winders says, Lowe challenges the USDA to follow him down an uncharted path. Exhibiting wild animals for money without a license is illegal under the Animal Welfare Act, whether it’s done at a brick-and-mortar zoo, on television, or on the internet. But when it comes to the internet, there’s little legal precedent for enforcing the law.As content featuring captive exotic animals on social platforms such as TikTok, Cameo, and YouTube becomes more popular than ever, the USDA now must decide whether to exert its authority over profit-driven online animal exhibitions or risk setting a troubling precedent, Winders says.“If the USDA allows commercialization to go unchecked online, it could incentivize the creation of a whole new industry of people monetizing animals [on social media] without any oversight,” she says. It would be “terrifyingly easy” for any social media star to get wild animals “without any expertise whatsoever” and start sharing them with an audience, she says. “Given that conditions are often so bad at facilities when there already is a layer of oversight, I’m very worried about what that could mean for animals.”Tiger King debuted on Netflix in March right as the U.S. shut down—a pop-culture escape from mounting COVID-19 anxiety. More entertainment than documentary, critics charged, the show glossed over the animal suffering rampant in roadside zoos. The show sparked endless memes; its stars—Lowe, Joseph Maldonado Passage (“Joe Exotic”), and others—rocketed to fame. Even as the pandemic spread among humans and it became clear that big cats could catch it, fans flocked to Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park to pet tiger cubs.Lowe, Maldonado-Passage’s former business partner and owner of the zoo and its animals, took advantage of his newfound fame, launching a merchandise shop and hyping his soon-to-launch Tiger King Park. He began charging more than $100 per video on Cameo, a platform where fans can pay celebrities to film short, personalized videos.The USDA’s June inspection came as Tiger King was still featuring heavily in the zeitgeist. Inspectors Boone and Cunningham found that the attending veterinarian—by whom monthly checks of the animals are required under the Animal Welfare Act—had visited the property only twice since early 2019 and that neither visit entailed veterinary checks of all the animals. The inspectors documented sick and injured animals, including Nala, the arthritic wolves, an underweight bear, and several unsafe enclosures, including one lemur cage that had rusted metal.After the inspectors told Lowe to remedy the problems, they returned in July and saw that little had improved and that the veterinarian still hadn’t been brought in. There was also something new: They reported smelling “the odor of decaying flesh,” which they traced to a not-operational refrigerated truck that was full of spoiling meat. No refrigeration was available on the property for food for the carnivores.Furthermore, 34 out of approximately 200 animals were missing, “with no disposition papers to document where they have gone,” the report says. Andre Bell, a USDA spokesperson, confirms that the inspectors asked where the animals had gone, but he declined to provide further details.When the USDA suspended Lowe’s license, on August 17, they issued an enforcement action alleging that he and Lauren Lowe had willfully and repeatedly violated the Animal Welfare Act since 2015. It cited a litany of violations, including failure to provide proper care for animals, failure to safely exhibit animals to the public, falsifying veterinary records, harassing a Nevada animal care official on social media, and more. On Facebook, Lowe denied these claims.A tiger cub is pictured at G.W. Zoo in September 2018. Cub petting, which was a popular activity at the zoo, relies on a constant supply of cubs young enough to handle safely. To have cubs available for visitors, roadside zoos often speed-breed tigers, lions, and tiger-lion hybrids, which, critics says, are separated too early from their mothers.He still owns more than 150 animals, including dozens of big cats, kangaroos, porcupines, and ring-tailed lemurs. Oklahoma is one of four states in the U.S. that allows residents to keep big cats without a permit.The USDA did not confiscate any animals during the June or July inspections. Bell says that the animals “did not meet the criteria in the regulations for confiscation.” Those criteria, however, state that inspectors may confiscate animals that are suffering as a result of an exhibitor’s failure to comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Winders argues that that threshold was certainly met here. “We’ve seen this over and over where it’s an egregious situation, and [the USDA] doesn’t exercise their confiscation authority and animals languish.” Bell did not respond to a request for comment about this by publication time.If Lowe follows through on using the new Tiger King Park as a film set, he would likely be in violation of the Animal Welfare Act.“Film or television work is considered regulated activity and requires an exhibitor license,” Bell says. “Mr. Lowe may keep his animals, but he cannot conduct regulated activity…[including] filming the animals for display to the public for compensation.”Lowe has said on Facebook that he’s in negotiations for season two of Tiger King. (Netflix did not respond to National Geographic’s multiple requests for comment.) He told People in June that he’s also signed with the Content Group, a California production company, for a separate reality show that will feature his animals, life at the new zoo, and “ongoing battles with animal rights groups.” The Content Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Lowe’s social media activities also could get him into trouble. He and other exotic animal owners with online followings regularly share videos of themselves swimming with, play-wrestling with, and bottle-feeding big cats. While it’s legal to post such content online, creators who set out to make a profit through sponsorships and advertising would cross the line.Lowe has produced at least two paid Cameo videos for customers featuring a white tiger named Thor since he lost his license on August 18.There’s a long history of people thinking the law doesn’t apply on the internet, says Nathalie Maréchal, a senior policy analyst at Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit that advocates for free expression and privacy on the internet.The 1996 Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace is a widely distributed early document on the applicability of government on the growing internet. Written by John Perry Barlow, founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group, it says, “Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.”“That was the genesis of the idea that law doesn’t touch you in cyberspace. But it was never actually true,” Maréchal says. Still, “it did take some time for governments and societies to translate and update the laws of the physical world to apply to the internet world.”That catch-up period has had consequences for animals. In the 1990s, when pet breeders started selling animals on the internet, the USDA chose not to regulate the activity. That led to a boom in unchecked online sales—pets were sold and shipped to customers across the country sight unseen, with no licensing or inspections required for facilities.A 2013 USDA inspector general report called this a “loophole,” estimating that there were between 8,000 and 15,000 online dog breeders. Later that year, the USDA updated its regulations to say that online dealers without physical storefronts were also subject to the Animal Welfare Act.One of the concerns about Lowe relinquishing his license is that it makes it much harder to know how the animals are, says Brittany Peet, deputy general counsel of captive animal law enforcement at the PETA Foundation. “At least when he was open to the public, there was some level of oversight,” she says. Not only was the public able to see the animals routinely and document any concerns, but the USDA was able to do unannounced inspections. Now the USDA would need a warrant to inspect his property and animals.“A warrant can’t be obtained without evidence that animals are in distress,” Winders says. And without public access to the animals, it would be very difficult to obtain evidence in the first place.The USDA’s open enforcement action against Jeff and Lauren Lowe seeks, among other things, to ban Lauren from getting an exhibitor license. A judge will determine whether they should face penalties, which could include banning Lowe from obtaining a license in the future and fines of up to $11,883 per violation per animal.Despite any plans Lowe has to continue making money from online animal videos and proposed television shows, which would be illegal, the fact remains that since August, he hasn’t been permitted to sell cub-petting experiences to zoo visitors.“That was the big moneymaker,” Winders says. “Cub petting is the reason we have as many tigers as we do in captivity in the U.S.” The activity relies on a constant supply of cubs young enough to handle safely. “That’s why we have this breeding mill situation. Once you cut off that incentive to continuously have babies, you’re putting a significant cap on the breeding and influx of animals.”But for Nala, the young lion the USDA inspectors found unresponsive in the mud, there is hope. On September 21, she and two other lion cubs, Amelia and Leo, were moved to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, in Keenesburg, Colorado, as the result of a separate court case centered on the previous illegal transfer of these animals.Peet, the PETA Foundation lawyer, was with the cubs on their journey to the Wild Animal Sanctuary in September. “Nala is so lame she can barely walk,” Peet said after the transfer. “And Leo has an obsessive suckling behavior, which very sadly sometimes happens in cats who have been prematurely separated from their mothers. He latches onto and suckles on his sister’s ears as if they were his mother’s nipples.”Lions Nala and Leo rest in a holding area on September 21 after arriving at The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado from Lowe’s Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. A veterinarian examined Nala after she arrived and found that she had multiple fractures, vitamin deficiencies, and bone malformations. The young lions are receiving medical treatment and will soon have acres to roam in their new home.A subsequent veterinary examination at Colorado State University found that Nala had multiple fractures, bone malformations, vitamin deficiencies, and “historical poor husbandry.” Pat Craig, the founder and executive director of the Wild Animal Sanctuary, says that although her prognosis is poor, she’s doing well, and her walking is already improving.On October 4, when Lowe missed the court-mandated deadline to have the animals removed from the Greater Wynnewood zoo, he also relinquished 11 wolves, two bears (found underweight by the USDA inspectors in June), and three more tigers to the Wild Animal Sanctuary. The bears will live in a 240-acre habitat, the tigers in a 45- to 75- acre habitat, and the wolves in 35 acres among several groups. Craig recently flew a drone over Tiger King Park and noted that the “entire facility would fit inside one habitat that we’d give to two or three animals.”Lowe’s legal troubles are set to continue. In addition to the open USDA case, the PETA Foundation has filed a notice of intent to sue him for violating the Endangered Species Act. The case is similar to a successful action the foundation brought against Tim Stark, another roadside zoo owner featured in Tiger King, that ended with him losing all 182 of his animals and being banned from owning big cats again. The complaint against Lowe alleges that, among other violations, he prematurely separated big cats from their mothers.Meanwhile, bipartisan lawmakers, various animal welfare organizations, the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and others have called for a federal law to regulate big cat ownership. The Big Cat Public Safety Act, under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives, aims to prohibit commercial breeding, public handling, and ownership of big cats as pets.",
"Dead frogs from the Solomon Islands, a remote archipelago in the South Pacific, set the tone for how the United States enforces animal welfare protections. And not for the better, experts say.It was back in 1995, and a wildlife inspector at New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport was called to check a shipment of animals that had just arrived. When he opened one of the wooden boxes, the first thing he saw was skinks. The lizards looked healthy enough.But in another compartment, he found several dozen dead and dying frogs “crushed together.” The compartment had no water or damp sponges to keep them hydrated, nor had the frogs been separated to prevent injuries. It was “not a normal way to ship frogs,” the inspector said later.The importer, Bronx Reptiles, Inc., was a commercial wholesale animal dealer that brought in live animals from around the world about twice a week, according to court records. The company had previously received three civil violations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for inhumane and improper shipment of wildlife.This time, the government brought a criminal case. Bruce Edelman, the owner of Bronx Reptiles, was found guilty and sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine.On appeal, his lawyers argued that he didn’t knowingly import the animals in substandard conditions and therefore couldn’t be held responsible. The court reversed the decision and found him not guilty.Although this occurred more than two decades ago, it continues to have a chilling effect on attempts through the court system to combat the inhumane treatment of imported wildlife. The U.S. Department of Justice, says spokesperson Danielle Nichols, is not aware of any such prosecutions since the Bronx Reptiles case’s failure.The lack of legal repercussions for the inhumane treatment of exotic pets has helped create an industry in which “animal suffering, abuse, and the human greed behind it constitutes” the norm, says Clifford Warwick, an independent reptile biologist and animal welfare specialist.Traditionally, scientists, conservationists, and policymakers have kept mum on the issue of animal welfare in the wildlife trade, prioritizing the protection of species and ecosystems over the well-being of individual animals. But now, an increasing number of researchers have begun calling for animal welfare to be made a conservation priority.The U.S. imported 3.24 billion live animals from 2000 to 2014, according to a 2020 paper in Scientific Data. Paperwork for the shipments indicate that about half came from the wild and nearly all were intended for commercial purposes, most likely the pet trade, according to the study authors.As the biggest importer in the world of wild animals for pets, the U.S. ought to set the bar for standards of humane treatment in the exotic pet trade, but so far, it’s failing, Warwick says. (He says he expects the same of the European Union, which imports almost as many exotic animals as the U.S.) Weak regulations, few wildlife inspectors, and the difficulty of prosecuting cases mean violators are likely to go unpunished.There are practical reasons for conservationists and policymakers to care about animal welfare: The more animals that die in trade because of ill treatment, the more that are captured from the wild to keep supplies coming, says Nitin Sekar, a conservation biologist with World Wildlife Fund-India and co-author of a paper in Science arguing that conservationists should strive to minimize animal suffering. Regardless of how well or badly animals are doing in the wild, he says, humans have an ethical responsibility not to cause harm.Whether they’re dealing in wild-caught or captive-bred animals, live animal traders supply pet stores, animal wholesalers, zoos, and biomedical research facilities with animals ranging from tropical fish to exotic mammals. The international import and export of certain at-risk species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global treaty that doesn’t cover most species.Wild-caught animals in the trade face extra stresses, traveling along bumpy roads in bags on motorbikes or stuffed into boxes in car trunks as they’re traded from hunter to middleman to exporter. During this journey, they may be deprived of food and water, and often come into contact with other captured animals, increasing the risk of disease spread and the possible emergence of novel zoonotic diseases that can jump to humans, Warwick says.In the marine aquarium industry, which takes up to 41.5 million animals from the wild each year, mortality can range from less than 5 percent to more than 90 percent depending on the species, according to a 2012 report by Defenders of Wildlife. Reef fish are sometimes stunned with cyanide or forced to the surface with explosive blasts to make them easier to collect.Birds too are at risk. Before 1992, when the U.S. banned the import of many wild-caught birds, conservationists estimated that for the 700,000 wild birds brought into the country each year, 3.5 million more died. For countries that continue to trade in wild-caught birds, there’s no evidence that the situation has improved, says Teresa Telecky, vice president for wildlife at Humane Society International.One of the most egregious cases highlighting the need for change occurred in 2009, when authorities raided U.S. Global Exotics, a wildlife wholesaler in Arlington, Texas. They found more than 26,400 animals of 171 species, about 80 percent of them “grossly sick, injured, or dead,” according to a 2014 report about the raid, which followed a seven-month undercover investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).The facility was shut down, but Jasen Shaw, the company’s owner, got what PETA’s Daphna Nachiminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigations, calls “a pathetic plea bargain.” He paid a penalty of $15,000 and was not barred from trading in wildlife.Reviewing the case, investigators calculated that each week, the company disposed of some 3,500 dead or nearly dead animals, equating to a 72 percent mortality rate every six weeks. During the municipal court case, one witness cited a study suggesting that 70 percent of all reptiles in the pet trade die before reaching their final destination.There’s no evidence that mortality rates across the industry have improved in the decade since the bust of U.S. Global Exotics, according to Warwick, who worked on the case.Telecky is even more pointed. “Those who are in the live animal industry are getting away with murder, literally,” she says.Those claims are strongly contested by Bob Likins, vice president of government affairs for the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC), the world’s largest pet trade association. “The exotic pet trade and the responsible pet care community as a whole is committed to ensuring the health and well-being of the animals in our care,” he says. “We will continue to work with enforcement officials to identify and address any evidence of a problem.”On a national and global scale, though, the problem is difficult to tackle, because it’s difficult to define. No one knows what percentage of animals die before they’re exported from their country of origin, multiple critics of the industry say, and it’s also unknown how many die prematurely in private homes, either for lack of appropriate care or their unsuitability for life in captivity.“It’s a completely black box,” says Sandra Altherr, co-founder of Pro Wildlife, a German conservation organization.The port of Los Angeles, which includes seven airports and seaports, has more wildlife moving in and out than any other port in the country. Yet in 2020, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had only six inspectors assigned to it.“We can’t cover everything,” says Joseph Ventura, one of the six inspectors.Given the logistical limits, usually they can pursue only the most extreme cases, Ventura says. “It’s kind of a given that oftentimes animals in the trade are not in the best health,” he says. “It’s something that we kind of accept, in a way.”There are legal limitations too. When Jonathan Kolby was working as an inspector at the Port of Newark, New Jersey, in the 2000s, shipments from Africa addressed to a U.S. pet trader arrived containing reptiles infested with ticks and other parasites. Kolby says was concerned about the animals’ health and worried that the ticks could introduce diseases into the country. But he had to clear the shipments, because he had no legal basis for seizing or delaying them. (Read more from Kolby about how U.S. fails to screen imported wildlife for zoonotic diseases.)CITES, the wildlife trade treaty, mandates that shipment of certain live animals must minimize injury or cruel treatment—but its regulations apply only to transport, not to how animals are captured, stockpiled, or eventually housed, says Sue Lieberman, vice president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society.Species covered by the treaty are supposed to be shipped according to the nearly 500 pages of rules outlined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), to which 290 airlines belong. They detail everything from custom-fit nylon stretchers with fin cut-outs for transporting beluga whales to non-slip flooring material for use in flamingos’ crates. The rules look good on paper, says the Humane Society’s Telecky, but they don’t carry the force of law.“The standards they have are really, really good,” Telecky says. “If everyone just implemented those, the world would be a better place for these animals in trade.”Federal regulations provide some humane treatment protections for animals when they enter the U.S., but thousands of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates fall between the cracks, critics say. A law called the Lacey Act makes it a misdemeanor for anyone “knowingly” to import wildlife under “inhumane or unhealthful conditions,” but the government has specified those conditions only for mammals and birds.Even identifying suffering reptiles and amphibians can be difficult, inspectors say, because they typically don’t exhibit the same symptoms of stress or disease as mammals, such as whining or crying and expressing distress through facial expressions.“How does an inspector make a judgement call that the animals are ‘too sick’ or are unwell enough to take some sort of action?” says Kolby, who now works as a wildlife trade consultant. He says he never received any training to make such evaluations. “This issue used to be a big thorn in my side, with sometimes unclear boundaries for enforcement,” he says.When inspectors do happen upon a shipment that clearly warrants action, such as injured or dead animals, they can issue fines, Ventura says.Usually, though, that’s where enforcement stops. Pointing to the Bronx Reptiles case, Bruce Weissgold, an independent consultant on wildlife trade, says that prosecutors attempting to pursue such incidents have “been unsuccessful in bringing a case to fruition, and this has jaded them on wanting to bring further cases.”Hoping to update the rules to protect millions more imported animals, the Fish and Wildlife Service drafted regulations in the mid-1990s to define principles for humane transport of reptiles and amphibians. Weissgold, then a wildlife trade policy specialist with the service, was part of the effort.A group of stakeholders from inside and outside government participated, and eventually they settled on a new set of guidelines, Weissgold says. But before the process to legally adopt the regulations began, the pet industry began to push back behind the scenes to pressure officials not to adopt the changes, Weissgold continues. PIJAC members also undertook a letter-writing campaign to protest the changes. The Fish and Wildlife Service ultimately dropped the effort.“PIJAC didn’t want regulations because the importers didn’t want them, and the importers didn’t want them because it would raise the cost of shipping the animals,” Weissgold says. “They felt that increasing the price of the animals to cover those costs would drive away their bread-and-butter consumers from the pet stores.”Telecky, who had been present at the meetings, also remembers this turn of events. “The pet industry is very powerful in all of this,” she says.When asked for comment, PIJAC’s Likins said that “historical documentation does not exist to comment on the mindset or actions taken by PIJAC staff or members 25 years ago.”The International Air Transport Association ended up adopting guidelines in 1997 similar to those drafted by the service, but without federal regulations, Ventura says, “there’s really nothing we could do if [an importer] said, ‘Nope, we’re not complying.’”Still, most U.S. reptile traders—at least those whose shipments come through Los Angeles—do voluntarily comply, he says.The government is still interested in creating regulations to ensure the humane transport of reptiles and amphibians, but other priorities simply continue to take precedence, says Frank Kohn, a biologist with the service specializing in CITES.Many conservationists and policymakers are only beginning to awaken to these challenges, but conservation biologist Sekar says the trend is in the right direction. As scientific evidence that animals think and feel grows, so does the public call for improving animal welfare.Still, he says, not enough exotic pet sellers and buyers think about this. Merchants are focused on profits, which may be reduced if high standards for animal welfare were imposed, Sekar says. And most consumers simply don’t consider how that snake or fish they're buying got to the pet store or whether the animal would be better off in the wild.“Just like markets don’t necessarily account for harm done to the climate or human laborers, markets don’t automatically look out for the well-being of individual animals,” Sekar says. “Any effort to establish standards to safeguard the quality of animal life will require lots of political pressure and have to somehow address the entrenched interests of businesses profiting from the current model.”Pet industry representatives insist that they’re in favor of such standards. “We want humane care and good science and veterinary practices,” says attorney Marshall Meyers, who serves on IATA’s Live Animals Board Advisory Panel and left PIJAC in 2010 after more than 30 years as executive vice president and general counsel. “We have not been opposed to regulations as long as they’re based on good data.”But political will in the U.S. so far has been lacking, Weissgold says. “In my opinion, it comes down to a fear of controversy, a lack of imagination, a poor working relationship between international affairs and law enforcement programs, and a heavy workload in other areas,” he says.Lieberman says the Wildlife Conservation Society and other non-governmental groups have recommended to President Joe Biden’s transition team that they work to improve international cooperation on wildlife trade-related issues, especially because regulating the trade in live animals is an important part of pandemic prevention.“The U.S. has walked away from multilateralism on many fronts, and this is one of several issues that point to the critical need for increased collaboration between governments,” Lieberman says.Should the U.S. and other countries commit to reforming the live wildlife trade, one suggestion Warwick and others offer is that trade should be permitted only for species on a “positive list”—animals for which ample scientific evidence exists that the they can be traded safely, sustainably, and without harm or distress.The Netherlands and Belgium have already implemented positive lists for exotic pet mammals, and Altherr and others are calling on the EU to apply the same approach for all exotic pets. “We shouldn’t allow for every animal that fits into a cage or glass tank to be kept as a pet,” Altherr says.A positive list in the U.S. isn’t under consideration at the moment, but consumers themselves can make a difference, Telecky says. She encourages people shopping for an exotic pet to ask whether it was bred in captivity or captured in the wild.“If you care about animal welfare, and you care about conservation,” she says, “don’t buy a wild animal.”Wildlife Watch is an investigative reporting project between National Geographic Society and National Geographic Partners focusing on wildlife crime and exploitation.

"Camels, the source of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak that started in 2012, await sale at a market northwest of Cairo in 2015. The legal trade in wildlife is as serious a risk for the spread of zoonotic diseases as the illegal trade, experts warn.Twenty thousand live bullfrogs from China that will be cooked and eaten as frog legs. Forty green monkeys from St. Kitts and Nevis for biomedical research. Three hundred giant clams from Vietnam and 30 stingrays from the Brazilian Amazon for home aquariums.That motley assortment is a miniscule glimpse of what the legal international wildlife trade might look like on a given day in any of the 41 ports of entry staffed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inspectors. I routinely saw consignments like these—alongside crates filled with shampoo bottles, cucumbers, and freshly cut roses—at the Port of Newark, New Jersey, when I was a wildlife inspector, from 2004 to 2010.At airports, seaports, and land border crossings in 2019, $4.3 billion of legal wildlife and wildlife products was imported into the U.S. Approximately 200 million live animals are imported to the U.S. annually, according to a five-year trade report: 175 million fish for the aquarium trade, and 25 million animals comprised of an array of mammals, amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, spiders, and more. On top of that, thousands of illegally traded shipments of wildlife are intercepted each year. In 2019 alone, the agency opened more than 10,000 illegal wildlife trade investigations.But along with such a diversity of wildlife, a kaleidoscope of pathogens is also entering the country. My experience with the Fish and Wildlife Service, where I worked for 10 years, first as a wildlife inspector and most recently as a policy specialist regulating and managing the international wildlife trade, showed me that although many controls have been implemented to combat illegal trade, the diseases that simultaneously hitchhike into the country on legally imported wildlife continue to go largely unnoticed.Importing any live animal brings with it the risk of disease—to native wildlife, to livestock, and to people. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China, theorized to have jumped from bats into humans and then spread at a wet market in Wuhan, possibly through an intermediate host, has shined a spotlight on how easily zoonotic diseases can emerge from wildlife. Indeed, an estimated 60 percent of known human diseases originated in animals, according to the World Organization for Animal Health.Much of the public discussion around COVID-19 has focused on the potential role of the illegal wildlife trade in spreading pathogens. But as a wildlife trade specialist and conservation biologist—I studied the spread of disease among imported frogs—I’ve learned that we need to think just as critically about the risks and vulnerabilities presented by the massive legal trade, which continues to place both ourselves and the world at risk of more pandemics.With few exceptions, the U.S. has no laws specifically requiring disease surveillance for wildlife entering the country, and the vast majority of wild animal imports are therefore not tested. Inspectors with the Fish and Wildlife Service are the first to set eyes on an imported shipment of animals, and they’re charged with enforcing a variety of national and international laws, regulations, and treaties that focus on preventing illegal and unsustainable trade. But its mandate doesn’t extend to monitoring animal or human health. Its only responsibilities related to disease are the enforcement of rules limiting trade in certain fish and salamander species, which have the potential to spread devastating disease to other animals of their kind.In fact, no federal agency is tasked with the comprehensive screening and monitoring of imported wildlife for disease.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulates the importation of wildlife and wildlife products known to “present a significant public health concern,” focusing primarily on bats, African rodents, and nonhuman primates, Jasmine Reed, a CDC spokesperson, wrote in an email. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) intervenes only if there’s a disease risk to poultry or livestock animals of agricultural importance.This leaves millions of animals that come into the U.S legally each year unchecked for diseases that have the potential to spill over to humans or other animals.The CDC insists it’s keeping an eye out. “CDC works closely with other federal agencies to ensure animals and animal products that present a public health concern are regulated,” Reed says. “Through our partnerships with international agencies, we are constantly evaluating and assessing what we and the international public health community do to detect, prevent, and control zoonotic disease threats.”“I’m confident that our authorities are doing the best they can with the resources they have,” says Catherine Machalaba, a policy advisor for EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the connections between human and wildlife health. “But I’m not confident that’s a good enough benchmark when we’re talking about leaving the door open [to potential diseases that are] a threat to our health and security.”About two million American bullfrogs are imported live to the U.S. from factory farms abroad each year to be eaten. Legally imported frogs have been found to carry the devastating chytrid fungus at high rates, putting all North America's amphibians at risk. With no government agency responsible for comprehensive pathogen screening and monitoring of imported wildlife, scientists have little understanding of the range of diseases being imported.The problem isn’t unique to the U.S.—most countries do not have a government agency that comprehensively screens wildlife imports for pathogens. “The absence of any formal entity dedicated to preventing the spread of diseases from the wildlife trade is such a chronic gap around the world,” Machalaba says. “When multiple agencies have to be called in for any given shipment, personnel is limited, and coordination is lacking, there’s bound to be gaps—a false sense of security that another agency has it covered.”Many recent zoonotic outbreaks affecting people sprang from trade that was allowed at the time, says Lee Skerratt, a wildlife biosecurity fellow at the University of Melbourne, in Australia.In 2003, for example, people in six U.S. states became ill from exposure to the monkeypox virus after it entered the country in a pet trade shipment of 800 rodents from Ghana. In that shipment, African giant pouched rats, rope squirrels, and dormice carried the virus. It spread to prairie dogs held in the same pet trade facility, which were then sold to the public, starting the animal-to-human outbreak. Luckily, although human-to-human transmission of monkeypox can occur, no cases were confirmed.Three months after the infected animals had been imported, the CDC banned the import of all African rodents into the U.S. That gave the Fish and Wildlife Service the legal power to detain shipments in violation of the ban and alert the CDC, which could choose to require quarantine, re-exportation, or euthanization of the animals.Although this outbreak led to an import ban on African rodents, the government stopped short of doing any risk assessments to consider whether rodents from other places might also carry diseases that would require regulation, Machalaba says.“Wildlife coming into the U.S. are sourced from many countries that are ‘hot spots’ for emerging diseases—of potential concern for human health but also posing threats to other sectors via our food systems and ecosystems,” Malachaba says.Officials have long known about the gaps in the U.S.’s regulatory system. In 2005, the National Academies of Science published a report that found a “significant gap in preventing and rapidly detecting emergent diseases” from imported wildlife.Five years later, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which audits government spending and operations, published a report on live animal imports and diseases. It found that the Fish and Wildlife Service “generally does not restrict the entry of imported wildlife that may pose disease risks.” Furthermore, the report says, the CDC doesn’t use its full power to prevent the import of live animals that pose a risk of zoonotic diseases.The 2010 report recommended that the CDC, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and USDA develop and implement a coordinated strategy to prevent the import of animals that may be carrying diseases. But a follow-up assessment in 2015 found that the agencies did not take action. There simply weren’t the economic or staffing resources to make it happen, it says.The ability to prevent and control emerging zoonotic diseases requires an understanding of the diversity and abundance of pathogens being imported. But without monitoring and surveillance of imported wildlife, we don’t have this information, Skerratt says. “This is a problem for the wildlife trade as there is much that we don’t know, especially for diseases that could affect other wildlife,” he says.The CDC also acknowledges the lack of research. “We need more data through risk assessments and basic research before adding any new regulations,” Reed says.But it’s a Catch-22: For an agency to systematically collect pathogen data from wildlife imports, it would need a legal mandate from the government. But the government is only likely to do that once it has pathogen data to guide its decisions.Pathogens passed from animals to humans aren’t the only cause for concern. Amphibian chytrid fungus, the aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is the first disease known to infect hundreds of species simultaneously and drive many of them toward extinction. It’s so dangerous because it can jump between nearly any amphibian—a class with more than 8,000 species. It has already spread to remote protected areas around the world. From my Ph.D. research, I discovered that imports of factory-farmed American bullfrogs—nearly 2.5 million a year, more than any other live amphibian species—introduce frighteningly high numbers of chytrid-infected animals into the U.S.The deadly amphibian chytrid fungus, introduced to the U.S. through the legal wildlife trade, has spread to native frog species across North America, even in protected areas like King's Canyon National Park, in California. The U.S. continues to allow the import of species known to carry the disease.Scientists note the role of legal transcontinental trade in driving the chytrid pandemic—yet the trade continues, despite the biological and economic cost. Domestically, for example, the Fish and Wildlife Service has spent millions of dollars to prevent chytrid-driven extinctions of native species, such as the endangered Wyoming toad, through captive breeding and reintroduction efforts, while continuing to allow legal importation of amphibians that spread the very pathogen threatening those native species.Humans have never been part of a pandemic on the scale of that now affecting amphibians. Even tragedies such as the Black Death, in the mid-1300s, and the 1918 influenza pandemic devastated only one species of mammal: humans. By contrast, emerging wildlife diseases, notably chytrid, have been much less picky in the diversity and numbers of animal hosts they infect and kill. Imagine what it would be like if the next pandemic could infect hundreds of the world’s 5,000 species of mammals—including humans—causing many to become extinct.An enormous variety of plants and animals are involved in the international wildlife trade, and many are a regular part of our daily lives: Imported seafood for dinner; timber for building homes and musical instruments; pet birds and frogs and aquarium fishes; mother-of-pearl buttons on dress shirts; medicinal plants like ginseng; cosmetic essential oils such as argan and frankincense; and even many of the orchids and cacti for home decoration. This is why ending the legal trade in wildlife seems unlikely, and why, Skerratt says, controlling disease at the source is the best way to minimize the risk to public health.Key to reducing the spread of pathogens is a “clean trade” program, in which private industry and government officials work together to implement safer strategies, according to Matthew Gray, associate director of the University of Tennessee Center for Wildlife Health, in Knoxville.Gray says that clean trade could involve testing either before transport or at the border, so that animal health certificates could accompany wildlife—similar to what’s required for livestock. “If clean trade is not economically sustainable, government subsidies could be provided, as done often with agriculture,” he says.It shouldn’t be too difficult to develop a program in the U.S. to monitor imported wildlife for pathogens and develop risk assessments, says Peter Jenkins, senior counsel for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an environmental nonprofit. “We have a very good model of this, and it’s the U.S. livestock trade.” The USDA’s Animal Plant and Health Service implements a comprehensive system of veterinary services and trade controls to reduce the risk of importing pathogens that can harm animals, including cattle, sheep, poultry and others.Jenkins estimates such a program could be implemented for a reasonable cost, with just $2 million and six full-time government employees, a figure developed with Congressional staff in 2015 when Jenkins was lobbying to expand the Fish and Wildlife Service’s “injurious wildlife” program. “We’re not talking about a Cadillac program. We just need people doing the research, making risk-based predictions, and then operationalizing those predictions to reduce risk.”Yet it hasn’t happened.“There seems to be a lack of economic incentive to create a wildlife health law in the U.S. to regulate the pathways of spread of wildlife pathogens, but the COVID-19 disease highlights the consequences of our lack of understanding of these pathogens,” says Priya Nanjappa, director of operations at Conservation Science Partners, Inc., a nonprofit that provides research and analysis for conservation projects.The lack of incentive, Najappa says, seems to stem from the false belief that if an imported disease doesn’t immediately threaten public health or agricultural animals, it’s not a major threat to economic interests. But take white-nose syndrome, a fungus that has decimated millions of bats, across several species, in the U.S. Some of these bat population crashes led to Endangered Species Act protections, which in turn place restrictions on economic activities such as logging within the species’ habitats.The CDC, Fish and Wildlife Service, and USDA did not comment on what kinds of resources the agencies would need to do additional risk assessments, implement monitoring for diseases in the wildlife trade, or whether the pandemic would prompt them to push for increased disease surveillance.With COVID-19 aiming a spotlight on long-existing deficiencies, now is the time for the best minds in the Fish and Wildlife Service, CDC, USDA, industry and academia to come together and consider what steps can be taken to sew this hole shut, before the next animal-origin pandemic is thrust into our daily lives.",
"Wet markets, like this one in Macau, are found throughout Asia and sell fresh vegetables, fruit, seafood, and meat. Although most wet markets don’t sell wildlife, the terms “wet market” and “wildlife market” are often conflated.Until earlier this year, most people had never heard of the term “wet market,” but the coronavirus pandemic has thrust it into the limelight. A wet market in Wuhan, China, called the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, is believed to be the source of COVID-19.Somewhat akin to farmer’s markets and found around the world, wet markets are typically large collections of open-air stalls selling fresh seafood, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Some wet markets sell and slaughter live animals on site, including chickens, fish, and shellfish. In China, they’re a staple of daily life for many.More rarely, wet markets also sell wild animals and their meat. The Huanan market, for example, had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were for sale: snakes, beavers, porcupines, and baby crocodiles, among other animals.Why “wet” markets? One explanation has to do with the liquid in these places: live fish splashing in tubs of water, melting ice keeping meat cold, the blood and innards of slaughtered animals. Another is simply that they deal in perishable goods (thus wet) instead of dry, durable goods.Although most wet markets don’t sell live wild animals, the terms “wet market” and “wildlife market” are often conflated, according to Aron White, a China specialist at the Environmental Investigation Agency, a London-based nonprofit.Wildlife markets, also found worldwide, specifically sell wild animals for meat or as pets. The markets themselves may be legal, though they sometimes offer illegal species alongside permitted ones. It’s unknown how many wildlife markets there are in China and elsewhere, and according to White, much of the trade in wildlife is now conducted online, making it even more difficult to track.Support for the closure of unregulated wildlife markets across Southeast Asia is widespread, according to a March poll commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund and made public on April 7. In a survey of about 5,000 people in Hong Kong, Japan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, 93 percent of participants supported government taking action to eliminate illegal and unregulated markets.Wild animal meat—bushmeat—is sold at local markets in many settings, including throughout India, Latin America, and Africa. Strictly, the term refers to the remains of animals caught in the forests and savannas of Africa, but it is widely used colloquially to refer to any wild animal meat.The conflation of “wet markets” and “wildlife markets” has caused confusion during the coronavirus pandemic, with some U.S. leaders making public calls for the closure of wet markets and lambasting China for continuing to allow them.China never ordered the closure of its wet markets—they’re an important source of affordable food and a livelihood for many.But on January 26, China did ban the trade and consumption of wild animals for food. And starting on January 1, the government temporarily closed the Huanan market, after it was identified as the likely source of many early cases of COVID-19. It remains closed, according to Xu Ling, director of the China office of TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring organization.Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which Chinese public health authorities say was the origin of most early cases of the novel coronavirus, was closed in early January. The market sold fresh produce and seafood, as well as wild animals that were slaughtered for meat. It has not been reopened.As lockdown restrictions have begun to ease in China, some of the country’s other wet markets are reportedly operating again—without wild animals and wild meat.As of April 14, 2020, China has not banned the commercial sale of wild animals for pets, traditional medicine, or ornamental uses.Close interactions with wild animals have caused numerous disease outbreaks in humans, including Ebola and HIV. (Learn more about how this novel coronavirus may have jumped from animals to people.)Buying, selling, and slaughtering wild animals for food is one way an animal-borne disease may infect people. Viruses can spread more easily if animals in markets are sick or kept in dirty, cramped conditions, such as in stacked cages. When animals are under duress, viral pathogens can intermingle, swap bits of their genetic code, and perhaps mutate in ways that make them more transmissible between species. In the case of respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, the virus can jump to food handlers or customers through exposure to an animal’s bodily fluids.Other forms of wildlife trade can be risky too, including the exotic pet industry and tapping animals or their parts for traditional medicine or ornamental uses, such as rugs or carvings. Animals used for those purposes may harbor viruses that can sicken preparers and customers. In August 2007, for example, a drum maker and his child in Connecticut both became ill with anthrax after his home and workplace became contaminated by a goatskin imported from Guinea. Apparently, it carried naturally occurring anthrax spores. People also can get sick from having wild animal pets such as turtles, which may carry salmonella.",
"Ugandan soldiers on patrol for the African Union pass a man carrying bushmeat in the Central African Republic.Bushmeat is a catchall phrase for the meat of wild animals, but it most often refers to the remains of animals killed in the forests and savannas of Africa.African people have long hunted bats, monkeys, rats, snakes, and other wild animals for sustenance. Smoked, dried, or cooked, the meat provides a valuable source of protein for people in rural communities where farming domesticated animals is too expensive or impractical. Hunting and selling bushmeat can also serve as an important source of income.But the scale of hunting is far greater today and has been increasing, facilitated by road building in the forest for logging and mining operations and fueled by growing demand in urban markets, where comparatively well-off customers consider wild-sourced protein a delicacy and a status symbol. A smaller international market for exotic meat thrives in Europe and the United States.As hunting becomes more widespread, risks to the environment and public health become grave.Although no one keeps track of how much bushmeat is hunted in total, conservation experts estimate that up to six million tons of bushmeat are taken from the Amazon and the Congo Basin each year. Hunting for bushmeat is considered one of the most immediate threats to African wildlife.Conservationists are especially concerned about the large-scale commercial hunting of slower-breeding species like apes and monkeys. On Bioko Island, off the coast of Equatorial Guinea, for example, hunting for bushmeat has decimated populations of the island’s seven endemic monkey species, which are all endangered.Even forest elephants, considered vulnerable to extinction, are targeted for their meat in parts of central Africa. It’s possible that the meat is a primary motivation for the hunters and that the elephant’s tusks, hacked off for the more-publicized ivory trade, are a mere byproduct.Wild animals are reservoirs for pathogens, and people who come in contact with their bodily fluids risk becoming infected with a zoonotic disease—a disease that jumps from animals to humans. People most at risk are hunters, those who prepare bushmeat, and consumers of undercooked bushmeat (cooking meat all the way through kills the pathogens).Researchers believe, for example, that bonobos, chimpanzees, and other primates spread HIV to people hunting or butchering them. Fruit bats were also the likely source of the Ebola epidemic in western Africa that killed more than 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016.Education campaigns are raising awareness about health and ecological risks associated with the bushmeat trade. And there are efforts to help those who rely on bushmeat to develop alternative sources of protein and income, such as farming cane rats and beekeeping.There are laws to stymie the trade, many of which have exemptions for indigenous communities that rely on small-scale hunting of bushmeat for subsistence. Countries have rules surrounding the export and import of wild game, and an international treaty prohibits or limits global commercial trade in vulnerable wildlife.Although many countries in Africa ban hunting of threatened species and require hunters and bushmeat vendors to purchase permits, researchers and conservationists say that lax enforcement has enabled the bushmeat trade to thrive.",
"Bats such as this Seba’s short-tailed fruit bat face various threats in Bolivia, including demand for their blood, which some believe has healing power.It’s not hard to find bats for sale in the marketplaces of Bolivia. They’re usually tucked away in pungent shoeboxes, some with as many as 20 bats jammed together, the live ones crawling over those that have already succumbed to disease or stress.People buy them so they can drink fresh bat blood for its purported healing properties—particularly, they think, to help manage epilepsy. “The belief is well-rooted within our society, mainly in the Andes,” explains bat specialist Luis F. Aguirre, director of the center for biodiversity and genetics at the University of San Simon, in Cochabamba. “I receive calls requesting bats at least five times a year,” he says.Aguirre is not in the business of selling bats to the highest bidder. For the past 20 years he’s worked to safeguard the animals as head of the Bolivian Bat Conservation Program, a network of volunteers and professionals who conduct research and educate people about bat misconceptions. But because Aguirre is a bat man, and because people want live bats—they contact him hoping he’ll be able to help procure fresh stock.“I once received a call from France from a Bolivian asking about bats,” he says. The caller wanted to treat a child’s epilepsy by feeding him bat blood. In that instance, and every other like it, Aguirre repeats the same refrain: That there’s no proof of any medicinal benefit from drinking bat blood and he strongly opposes the practice.Yet the belief—and killings—persist. Officially, bat hunting is illegal. Bolivian law forbids the killing or sale of any wild animal without proper permitting, and the offense is punishable with up to six years in prison. Still, research Aguirre and colleagues published in 2010 reported that more than 3,000 bats were sold every month in just four major Bolivian cities. The species were varied but included fruit bats, insect-eating bats, and vampire bats.Aguirre says regular monitoring suggests that sales remain at similar levels today—and may even have increased—despite greater attention on wildlife crime and public pressure to address it. The only real difference is that the bats are no longer displayed as openly as in years past, he said in an email. “But it’s not difficult to find them.”Whereas hunting bats is illegal, the right to practice traditional medicine is nevertheless backed with the force of law. When longstanding cultural practices and wildlife protection are somewhat at odds, the latter often takes second place, says University of Mississippi anthropologist Kate McGurn Centellas, who studies traditional medicine in the country.To date, there has been no record of arrests related to bat killing or trading, according to Rodrigo Herrera, legal assessor at the General Directorate of Biodiversity and Protected Areas in the Ministry of Environment and Water. The Bolivian government says they have no official records of bat killings and that their only related report is of an incident from 2015 in the capital, La Paz, where 22 bats of various species were being sold for medicinal use and were confiscated. All the animals later died.The belief that the blood of a bat will help heal someone with epilepsy is hard to prove or disprove. According to Aguirre, if a person with epilepsy drank bat blood, suffered no seizures for a time, but then had one, believers might simply say that the blood’s potency must have faded—signaling the need for a fresh bat.The practice is steeped in ritual, and the origins of the putative powers of bat blood remain obscure. Bolivians’ have a deep cultural commitment to traditional medicine, which can include animal offerings and herbal remedies. To bring good luck to a home or scientific laboratory, for example, a dried llama fetus may be burned and its ashes buried under the building, Centellas says. She notes that blood is also seen as a strong life force that, if consumed, can transfer some of its properties.As for bats, their value likely comes from the fact that they’re viewed as a powerful creature with unique characteristics, Centellas says. “They fly, but they’re mammals—not birds. They’re seen as not neatly fitting into any category, so that might be the source of their purported curative powers.” In particular, she adds, “by consuming bat blood, you can perhaps balance or correct what would be seen as a disturbance or imbalance in the human body—manifested as seizures, or what we know in the biomedical system as epilepsy.”Typically, a bat would be obtained alive, its head chopped off, and the blood drunk fresh, Aguirre says. But a second option, if the bat is already dead, would be to fry the bat with its fur on and place it in a cloth bag that would then be soaked in alcohol for future quaffing—something akin to mezcal served with a worm inside the bottle.Centellas, who has not witnessed either ritual, says the two practices seem consistent with the general logic and approach of others in Bolivia that she has seen for herself. Snakes, for example, are often placed in alcohol and drunk later, she says, in the hope that the concoction will increase virility, stamina or fertility, among other things.Bats sold for their blood—which Aguirre’s market surveys show may include various species of fruit bats, insect-eating bats such as the mouse-eared bat, and vampire bats—are not rare enough to be considered endangered. (Read about vampire bats here.)Up to 20 bats of various species, including vampire bats like this one, may be crammed together in shoeboxes for sale in Bolivian markets.People who sell bats in the markets also aren’t the ones who hunt them. Intermediaries in places where the bats roost may come upon them in abandoned houses, caves, and forest areas, Aguirre says. They often snag the bats in nets like those used to catch butterflies. They’re then put in cloth bags or boxes for transport to the urban markets.Dire as this sounds for Bolivia’s bats, killing them for their blood is far from their gravest threat, says Rodrigo A. Medellín, co-chair of the bat specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which tracks the status of species.“The biggest threat continues to be roost destruction and disturbance, and habitat destruction,” Medellín, who is also a National Geographic explorer, emphasized in an email. “Three thousand bats a month is unfortunately nothing compared to the mortality caused by habitat change and roost destruction.”Any reduction in the number of bats can be harmful to ecosystems by, for example, taking out crucial plant pollinators and bug exterminators. And opportunistic hunting for bats puts people at risk too.“Insect-eating bats are very good at vector control—they eat mosquitoes and other arthropods that carry diseases or parasites like malaria that infect people,” says Jonathan Towner, a disease ecologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, Georgia, who specializes in highly dangerous pathogens. With fewer bats, there will be more of those bugs, he notes, and that may boost the chances that people will be exposed to diseases such as yellow fever, zika, or malaria.Spending time wrangling bats also carries direct health risks. The chief concern is rabies, according to Brian Bird, a virologist, veterinarian, and bat expert at the University of California Davis One Health Institute. And an infected bat in a stressful situation, such as being crammed in a box with other bats, may bite more than usual, spreading rabies.Vampire bats, which are found only in Latin America, “are in many ways the perfect vector for rabies,” says Gerald Carter, a National Geographic explorer and vampire bat expert at Ohio State University, in Columbus. They drink blood, and rabies is transmitted by biting—allowing the virus to jump from an infected bat to the animal it bites.For people drinking bat blood, the risk of getting rabies is low because the virus is most prevalent in saliva and tissue like the brain, not other bodily fluids. Still, there may be other pathogens—perhaps new ones—that could be present in raw bat blood, Towner says. And if the bat died on its own, he adds, that itself should be worrying—a dead bat or a sick bat is much more likely to have disease.A long-haired rousette (Rousettus lanosus) at the Lincoln Children's Zoo in Lincoln, Nebraska.No official records have linked the practice of drinking bat blood to sick Bolivian patients. But that could just be a matter of lackluster surveillance, Bird and other public health experts say. “When you kill and drink the blood of these animals, you’re exposing yourself to a whole spectrum of known and potential pathogens,” he warns.Bats, in particular, have a recent history of being linked to emerging viruses with serious consequences for people—like Ebola, SARS, and a cousin of Ebola’s called Marburg. In each instance, a pathogen jumped from its natural reservoir (another species), to a group of people who had little prior exposure to it and consequently very little immunological protection against it—allowing a flare-up to become a major crisis.“It really is these rare spillover events that cause epidemics,” Bird says. “While we know spillovers are rare, it’s people engaging in high-risk activities like consumption of bush meat where an uncommon spillover event becomes more common.”",
"A long-haired rousette, Rousettus lanosus, at the Lincoln Children's Zoo.Few animals have captured the imagination like bats. From superheroes to vampires, bats' unique characteristics have inspired fascination for centuries, but in real life, they play a critical role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem.In addition to controlling bug populations, bats are a critical source of pollination. In the Southwest U.S. and in Mexico, they pollinate agave plants, making them essential for tequila production.Bats have uniquely adapted to their environment. It's a common misconception that they're blind (and in fact they see three times better than people), but during the night they rely primarily on their ears. Their screeches allow them to echolocate, or create a sonar map of their surroundings.With the heaviest wings of any flying animal, bats have developed unique acrobatics to land upside down in their resting position. With one wing pulled close to its body and the other extended, a bat uses inertia to swing upside down in only a fraction of a second.Bat Appreciation Day, which falls on April 17, puts a spotlight on the flying mammals. The U.S. Department of Energy uses the seemingly playful holiday to highlight the issues facing the nation's bat populations.Fatalities caused by wind turbines have become increasingly common since the increased use of wind energy. As many as hundreds of thousands of migratory bats may be dying every year because of wind turbines. Bats, which use sonar to navigate, collide with turbine blades when they fly too close.Reducing wind turbine speeds during peak migration and broadcasting ultrasonic sounds have helped mitigate the number of bats killed annually. However, many bats still face threats from urban sprawl and white-nose syndrome, a fungus that grows on bats during winter hibernation and can lead to their starvation.",
"It’s been more than ten years since the first cases of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) were identified in southern China. It spread to four continents and infected at least 8,200 people before heroic efforts finally brought its progress to a halt. Since then, scientists have sequenced the genome of the virus behind the disease—a coronoavirus called SARS-CoV—and teased apart its infectious tricks. But one lingering question remained: Where did it come from?At first, the answer seemed straightforward. When investigators swept Chinese animal markets, they found SARS-CoV in palm civets. The animals were quickly culled in their thousands, but later studies showed that their wild or farmed relatives don’t actually carry the virus. They may have acted as a stepping stone for SARS-CoV, but they weren’t its natural reservoir.Then in 2005, two teams of scientists found that Chinese horseshoe bats harbour a wide range of SARS-like coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV itself belongs to f this diverse family. It seemed that bats, not civets, were the source of SARS—a conclusion that was supported by several later studies.“But there were doubters,” says Peter Daszak from EcoHealth Alliance, who was involved in one of these studies. “We were among them.”There were a few niggling problems. The genes of the new coronaviruses had been sequenced but no one had managed to grow one in a laboratory and take a look at it. None of them looked like they could attack the same target that SARS-CoV does—a human protein called ACE2. And although they were all similar to SARS-CoV, none was a good enough match to actually be a direct ancestor. “It would have taken around 100 mutations to turn those into something that could directly infect people,” says Daszak. “That’s not something you’d expect from a bat in a wildlife market.”The team have now quelled these doubts. They’ve been spending the last few years travelling to 20 countries and searching for new viruses among groups of mammals that are notorious as virus-carriers. Bats are very much on the list, and Chinese bats in particular.Led by Xing-Yi Ge, Jia-Lu Li and Xing-Lou Yang, the team spent a year in the southern city of Kunming, repeatedly taking faecal samples and anal swabs from a colony of horseshoe bats. They identified seven strains of coronaviruses, including two new ones that were 95 percent identical to SARS-CoV. That’s a far closer match than any virus thus far discovered.The team even manage to isolate one of the new viruses and grow it in the lab. It could infect human lung cells, as well as cells from pigs and horseshoe bats. And it used the ACE2 protein as a gateway for breaking into its hosts. It’s the most SARS-like virus ever found.“That’s remarkable,” says Thomas Ksiazek, a virologist who was the lead author on the paper that first described SARS-CoV. “They’re the first ones to make an isolate, which authenticates the whole thing.”This is the strongest evidence yet that SARS-CoV originated in bats. “Maybe a bat with this virus or something similar got into a market, along with dozens of mammals it had never got into contact with before. Civets, ferret-badgers, rabbits, you name it,” says Daszak. Those other species could have acted as stepping stones on the virus’s path from bats to humans, but since the new strains can stick to ACE2 and infect humans cells, they may have been able to jump directly. “This tells me that we didn’t need civets, or even markets, for SARS to emerge,” says Daszak.Ksiazek thinks that’s unlikely. “If you look at bat-borne diseases, instances of direct transmission to humans aren’t common, with exceptions like Ebola and Marburg,” he says. Likewise, Christian Drosten from the University Hospital at Bonn still believes that civets were an intermediate host. “That doesn’t make the paper less valuable,” he says. “It means that not every virus sitting in bats is dangerous, but there are some which probably are.Coronaviruses were mostly neglected until SARS came along, but they seem to be an increasing problem. There’s SARS-CoV itself. There’s the new virus that’s responsible the emerging threat of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  And there are goodness knows how many undiscovered strains, which could infect humans. “They’re very evolvable,” says Daszak. “They don’t correct errors in their genome when they make copies of themselves, so you get a lot of mutations, which allows them to lock onto new receptors in new hosts. They’re very good at jumping hosts.”The team are now checking people who work in Chinese wildlife markets and farms to see if they’ve already been infected by the new SARS-like viruses. And they’re starting pragmatic programmes to minimise the risk of future spillovers. No matter your feelings on China’s wildlife trade, it’s a cultural phenomenon that’s not going away any time soon. So rather than calling for bans, the team are trying to educate farmers about the species most likely to harbour deadly viruses, and steer them towards safe choices. “We know a guy who farms bamboo rats, while other farmers bring bats in from the wild,” says Daszak. “We’d suggest that bamboo rats are a better alternative to bats right now.”They’re also pushing for bigger projects to identify undiscovered viruses. “It’s pretty sad that it’s taken so long to find these [new corona]viruses,” says Daszak. “We as a species are pretty pathetic about getting ready for pandemics. We sit here and wait for them to emerge, and then we say, Wow, where did that come from?”Sick of being caught on the backfoot, Daszak and his colleagues are spearheading a new approach to identify every single mammalian virus before they have a chance to spread to humans. They reckon that there are around 320,000 of them, and that it would take USD $1.4 billion to find them all. That’s a trivial cost compared to the price of a pandemic—SARS alone is estimated to have cost USD 16 billion.To continue reading about this new approach, see my piece for The Scientist. And for more about the SARS story, do read David Quammen’s wonderful book, Spillover.Reference: Ge, Li, Yang, Chmura, Zhu, Epstein, Mazet, Hu, Zhang, Peng, Zhang, Luo, Tan, Wang, Zhu, Cramer, Zhang, Wang, Daszak & Shi. 2013.

"Animal trainer Pamela Rosaire Zoppe bought this chimpanzee from pet owners who could no longer keep him.Each year millions of exotic animals are sold around the world, destined for people’s basements and backyards. The term “exotic” doesn’t have a set definition, but it usually refers to a wild animal or one that’s more unusual than your standard dog or cat. The booming business in exotic pets is known as the exotic pet trade.Some of this trade is legal, but many times animals are captured from the wild illegally to supply demand for exotic pets. The illicit sales of live animals comprises a major part of the overall illegal wildlife trade, a multibillion-dollar global black market.People have kept exotic pets throughout history, but demand for unique creatures has exploded in recent years. Much of this can be attributed to the popularity of e-commerce and social media websites, which have provided a way for people to easily advertise the sale of live animals. They’ve also popularized exotic animals by providing a place where people can show them off. A flurry of videos posted to YouTube in 2015 of slow lorises eating rice balls in captivity, for example, went viral and led to poaching of the wide-eyed primates for the pet trade.Some exotic pets are bred in captivity. Conservationists often see captive breeding as a way to save wild animals from poaching for the pet trade, and many countries allow for the export of captive-bred animals as long as the proper legal documents are obtained.But countless animals are taken from the wild before they’re sold as pets. After an animal is plucked from the wild—often in violation of the law—it might be used in a breeding operation, sold locally, smuggled out of the country, or intentionally mislabeled as captive-bred and exported legally. Researchers have discovered that people are “laundering” Indian star tortoises from Jordan, red-eyed tree frogs from Nicaragua, and many other species.Rampant poaching for the exotic pet trade is devastating animal populations worldwide. It has decimated numbers of Madagascar’s prized radiated tortoises, for example, and led to the endangered status of African gray parrots, birds known for their impressive vocal abilities. What’s more, many animals suffer during capture and transport—and even if they do end up at their final destination alive, they are often distressed—unable to eat, move, and behave as they would in the wild.The exotic pet business also affects humans and animals not involved in the trade. Wild animals have the potential to attack their owners or spread disease, such as ebola and SARS. An outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease (END), which resulted in the deaths of 12 million birds in the U.S. in the 1970s, was traced to parrots smuggled from South America.The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), an international agreement signed by 183 governments, has voted to ban or limit trade in many animal species sought after as pets. Many countries also prohibit domestic sales or possession of certain animals. In the U.S., laws regulating the ownership of exotic pets vary from state to state.In addition, nonprofits around the world have been trying to shut down the exotic pet trade by educating people about the harms of owning these animals. Research conducted by the World Animal Protection, a U.K.-based nonprofit, found that the best way to deter people from owning an exotic animal is to emphasize the risks they pose to humans, not the animals themselves.",
"More than five tons of smuggled ivory burn in Kenya. The demand for ivory exceeds the supply, according to Rachel Love Nuwer's new book Poached.A recent report by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature showed that between 1970 and 2014 the vertebrate population declined by an average of 60 percent. While this was mostly due to habitat loss, the illegal trade in wildlife—whether rhino horn, tiger bone, or animals captured for the exotic pet market—poses a growing threat to many species’ survival. But as National Geographic contributor Rachel Love Nuwer writes in her new book Poached: Inside the Dark World of Wildlife Trafficking, many brave individuals and organizations are battling to expose the criminals—and save the animals.Speaking from her apartment in Brooklyn, New York, Nuwer explained how superstitious beliefs in China and Southeast Asia are a driving force of the trade; how wildlife trafficking needs to be tackled by law enforcement, not conservationists; and how she disguised herself as a prostitute to go undercover at a tiger farm in Laos.The most obviously affected animals are the big, charismatic megafauna, like rhinos, elephants, tigers, and even bears. In reality, though, we’re talking about millions of individual animals of thousands of species. It spans poaching for jewelry, pets, traditional medicines, trophies, or wild meat, which some cultures consider a luxury item. This is a global trade. However, much of the demand for illegal wildlife products is in Asia, especially in China and Vietnam. That’s predominantly because wealth in those places has been increasing over the past decades, so people who previously could not afford things like ivory jewelry or rhino horn carvings now can do so. There’s more demand than there is supply.There’s a misconception, especially in the media, that there are these Pablo Escobar-like kingpins controlling everything. While there is some evidence that a few people like that do exist, much of this illegal trade is made up of disorganized, opportunistic criminals. The guy in Zimbabwe killing an elephant and running its tusks to the nearby village won’t know the guy in the town, who then sells those tusks to the corrupt airport official who, in turn, doesn’t know who exactly the tusks are going to in Malaysia or Hong Kong.That’s one of the reasons that it’s so hard to tackle this thing. It’s not like you can just knock out a couple of big guys at the top and you’ve solved it. Even when you do make arrests of so-called kingpins, they’re oftentimes readily replaced by their colleagues.Pangolins are definitely my new favorite animal since writing this book. They are better known here in the U.S. and the U.K. as scaly anteaters, which is funny because they’re not that closely related to anteaters. They’re more closely related to cats and dogs. They look like walking pinecones with feet, or tiny, odd-looking dragons.There are four species of pangolins in Asia and four in Africa. Unfortunately, because they look so strange, people tend to attribute magical or medicinal properties to them. Traditional societies all over the world have different uses for pangolins, especially their scales. The biggest source of demand is traditional Chinese medicine, a version of which is also practiced in Vietnam. Their scales are boiled, dried, then ground up into a powder and served to women who are having trouble lactating, for example. In Vietnam their meat is also considered a delicacy. You call up a wild meat restaurant in advance and then it will either be prepared for you, or its throat will be slit on the spot.Definitely not! There are an estimated 4,000 tigers left in the wild today. There’s many more than that in captivity. When I say captivity, I mean in people’s backyards in the U.S. and elsewhere, which is a completely different issue­—and then on so-called tiger farms in China and Southeast Asia. The tigers are bred, then slaughtered for their bones, meat, fur, teeth, and claws. Particularly sought after are the penises and bones, which are soaked in an awful-tasting rice wine and served, usually to men. They’re supposed to imbue men with the prowess and sexual energy of the tiger.The Chinese have been really good about making a show of shutting down the ivory trade recently, but other than that there’s nothing going on to combat the illegal wildlife trade. President Xi has been cutting back on corruption, which means closing wild meat restaurants. But there’s no re-education campaign to discourage tiger use. In fact, investigations by conservation groups show that government officials are some of the most common purchasers of tiger bone wine in China and other Asian countries. They have no intention of closing this down.[Laughs] I was quite nervous about visiting this place. It’s supposed to be a hotbed of crime, drugs, prostitution and yes, illegal wildlife trade. I had spoken with a woman named Debbie Banks, an excellent wildlife investigator working at the Environmental Investigation Agency in London, and she told me the only people who go there who are not Chinese, Vietnamese, or Thai are Russian or Ukrainian prostitutes, or else backpackers. I thought, okay, the former sounds a little bit more fun and I own some scanty clothes anyway, so I’ll go with that. I brought a friend and my husband from New York because I was nervous about going by myself. We wore ridiculous clothes and nobody seemed to notice or care about us, which was great. We could browse through these shops and look at huge quantities of ivory, rhino horn, and tiger products openly for sale, and we dropped by the Kings Romans casino where ivory and rhino horn were also openly displayed. We visited the tiger farm on the premises, where I was told clients can essentially go to shop for what animal they want to have for dinner at one of the on-site restaurants. This was an especially difficult experience for me; there were tigers pacing in small cages yowling mournfully, and a number of bears that were clearly suffering from cage-induced mania.There’s definitely a constituency of people, especially in China and South Asian countries, who argue for what is called “sustainable use of wildlife products,” whether that’s selling ivory or raising tigers and rhinos for their body parts. But tiger farms have been closely linked with laundering of tigers illegally caught in the wild, then passed off as products. So tiger farms pose a critical threat to wild tigers. That’s not even to touch on the humane animal advocacy side of things. These animals live miserable lives.The first huge ivory burn took place in 1989. It was organized in Kenya by the paleontologist Richard Leaky. His idea was to create a spectacle that the world could not ignore. And it worked. A few months later it led to nations voting to give elephants the highest degree of international protection, which effectively banned commercial trade of ivory, which was an amazing accomplishment!Whether the burns lower trafficking is not proven. But it’s not the primary goal of ivory burns; it’s an awareness-raising method to spread the word about the illegal wildlife trade. Another important purpose is to simply get the ivory out of circulation because a lot of the storehouses, particularly in developing countries, are notorious for leaking ivory and rhino horn out. You have 50 tons of ivory that you seize from some criminal and then a few weeks or months later that 50 tons has been reduced to 25, because of corruption. The big message is that ivory should never be traded. It has no purpose at all except for elephant tusks on elephants.Jill is amazing. She was living in Hong Kong doing work on cats and dogs, when someone mentioned to her a bear farm for this bear bile trade, and her interest was piqued. She took a tour to a bear farm in mainland China and left the tour group at one point because she heard noises in the basement. She crept down these stairs to a dark room where she found cages and cages of bears in horrific condition, with open wounds. Jill had this moment of connection and wound up dedicating her life to ending bear farming for bile. Her organization, Animals Asia, has saved hundreds of bears from these farms and brought them to rehabilitation sites.The thing about bear bile is that it’s one of the few traditional Chinese medicines that is efficacious. However, the active component, ursodeoxycholic acid, can be synthesized in a lab so you do not need bears to be put in these awful situations or kept in captivity. The problem is, users in China and Vietnam want this to be a wild, free animal, so they think they are absorbing the essence of this pure, strong thing.That’s a great point! Definitely not enough is being done because virtually nothing is being done in terms of investigating the financial crime side of things. The problem with the illegal wildlife trade is that it’s so often seen as something in the purview of conservationists, biologists or ecologists. But that’s like giving botanists the job of tackling the cocaine and heroin trade. We need to get criminal experts involved, including money-laundering experts, because a lot of times the punishments that go with breaking wildlife laws are really weak. It’s a $100 fine for trafficking a rhino horn that might be worth $30,000! Money laundering laws would be much stronger. So I think crime is where we should be focusing. We need criminal experts, not wildlife experts, and we need to treat this like any other type of crime, not something special just because it involves wildlife.The Zakouma National Park in Chad had an elephant population of around 4,000, one of the biggest herds in Central Africa, but in less than a decade that population fell to around 450. It was being absolutely hammered by Janjaweed poachers riding down from Sudan for this killing spree and taking the ivory back to sell. Everybody had resigned themselves to saying goodbye to those elephants. However, a spectacular non-profit organization called African Parks negotiated with the President of Chad to take over the park. Thanks to their efforts, poaching is virtually at zero, and the elephant population is once again growing. They’re even having new babies, which is huge!There are other people who are giving it their all to save their countries’ wildlife. Thai Van Nguyen, the founder of Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, is a great example. He’s Vietnamese, his organization is entirely run by Vietnamese and he is the only person in Vietnam equipped to rehabilitate pangolins rescued from the illegal wildlife trade. Thai brings them back to his facility, rehabilitates them, and when they’re strong enough he and his colleagues take the pangolins to secret locations and release them.People like Thai are buying time for the rest of us as we get our acts together and decide this is something we want to stop. And that animals are worth saving.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk. Follow him on Twitter or at simonworrallauthor.com.",
"The World Wildlife Fund For Nature’s Living Planet Report released this week describes a catastrophic decline in animal populations the world over. But it was widely misinterpreted by many outlets, with headlines wrongly insisting that we’ve lost 60 percent of all animals over the course of 40 years. The reality is more nuanced, though still alarming.The biannual report examined trends in the global Living Planet Index, a biologist’s “stock market index” for the diversity and abundance of animals worldwide. If the global score is steady or increasing, animals are generally thriving, while a falling score indicates a planet-wide problem.The Living Planet Index has taken a sudden nosedive—it’s down 60 percent since 1970, the blink of an eye in evolutionary time. And we’re all invested.The Living Planet Index (LPI) combines data on thousands of species with very different lifestyles and very different conservation statuses. It's not a census in which a Eurasian pygmy shrew—of which there are plenty—would be given equal weight to a critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros.The LPI takes into account the fact that one less rhino is, for its overall population, a very big deal. But a few thousand fewer pygmy shrews is pretty trivial; it could be chalked up to a rounding error. Some populations in the study lost far more than 60 percent of their individuals, and some lost far fewer. But the average represented by the LPI speaks to a catastrophic global trend.Stated another way, the report found that populations of vertebrates (animals with backbones) declined by 60 percent on average. But that’s not the same as saying that we’ve wiped out 60 percent of all animals, which the report makes clear.Let’s say for example you have 50 tigers, 200 falcons, and 10,000 squirrels. Let’s say the first population declines by 90 percent, to 5 tigers. The second declines 80 percent, to 40 falcons. And the squirrels drop to 9,000—a 10 percent fall. That’s a 60 percent average decline of these three fictitious populations, but only a total decline of 12 percent of the individuals.Or take the example of a single species: Imagine gray wolf populations are declining by an average of 60 percent. That doesn’t mean we’ve lost 60 percent of, say, all individual gray wolves. It means that some gray wolf packs have suffered horrific losses, perhaps even local extinction, while others have declined less sharply—but remember, packs aren’t all the same size. Local extinction in rural Idaho could mean the loss of only four animals, but since each distinct population makes the species more resilient, it’s still important information for biologists to capture.For decades, economists and ecologists have wrestled with how to quantify the value of ecosystem services—the goods and services that nature provides, from bee-assisted crop pollination to water filtration courtesy of mollusks. The Living Planet Report pegs the value of ecosystem services at $125 trillion, just a few trillion shy of the world’s total GDP.Though the numbers may be controversial, since people disagree about how to assign such values, even Wall Street has to admit that nature does a lot of the heavy lifting for us. Animal pollinators are responsible for a third of all food production, and we depend on cud-chewing animals to recycle soil. Birds, bats, and reptiles rein in disease-spreading mosquitoes, while medical researchers look to elusive rainforest critters for the next cancer treatment.Due to intricate food webs, the fate of a single animal population can have far-reaching and unexpected consequences.University of Maine biologist Brian McGill explains the frustration of working on a biodiversity census by comparing it to other nature-monitoring projects with extensive infrastructure, like weather prediction. “In the U.S. alone, the National Weather Service spends billions of dollars a year to make accurate weather forecasts—investment in ground weather stations, ocean buoys, radiosonde balloons, and satellites to get the best possible measurements of the current state of the weather,” he says. “We have no equivalent for biodiversity.”Through its Living Planet Reports, the WWF keeps tabs on 4,005 species of vertebrates in 16,705 distinct populations. That figure is dwarfed by the 63,000 total described species of vertebrates—and scientists think we've only documented a fraction of what's out there.Strategically scattered across continents and biomes, those populations serve as a point of reference for all the species we don’t have data on. It’s been hard to get a precise headcount on smaller animals like ants, for example, but keeping up with birds and mammals that feed on them in the same neighborhood gives scientists a good sense of how the local ecosystem is holding up.The “neighborhoods” in biggest trouble, according to the report, are freshwater and tropical ecosystems. Both are historical hotspots for biodiversity, supporting an unusually high concentration of species. But over exploitation, climate change, and pollution have whittled away these once-rich habitats.The average Living Planet Index score for freshwater populations has plummeted by 83 percent, meaning that populations of water-dwelling animals has declined by this amount on average. And the LPI in the neotropics—the Carribbean, Central and South America, and slivers of Florida and Texas—has fallen by 89 percent.Stemming the tide of extinction will require cooperation on a global scale, so scientists have been alarmed by an international backsliding on environmental regulations.The Trump administration continues to push to roll back elements of the Endangered Species Act, the United States’ bedrock environmental policy. And earlier this week, the Chinese government legalized the trade of rhino horns and tiger bones, a move conservationists have decried.At the same time that Brazil’s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro plans to develop the Amazon to bolster his country’s economy, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report highlighted “biological diversity loss and ecosystem collapse” as one of the top 10 economic threats in 2018.As Alabama ecologist E.O. Wilson put it in his book, The Future of Life, “Perhaps the time has come to cease calling it the ‘environmentalist’ view, as though it were a lobbying effort outside the mainstream of human activity, and to start calling it the real-world view.” Animal conservation isn’t a special interest anymore. It’s a human interest.",
"Dawn, and mist holds the forest. Only a short stretch of red dirt track can be seen. Suddenly—emerging from the red-gold haze of dust and misted light—a tigress ambles into view. First she stops to rub her right-side whiskers against a roadside tree. Then she crosses the road and rubs her left-side whiskers. Then she turns to regard us with a look of infinite and bored indifference.And then, as if relenting, she reaches up the tree to claw the bark, turning her profile to us, and with it the full impact of her tigerness—the improbable, the gorgeous, the iconographic and visibly powerful flanks.The tiger. Panthera tigris, largest of all the big cats, to which even biological terminology defers with awed expressions like "apex predator," "charismatic megafauna," "umbrella species." One of the most formidable carnivores on the planet, and yet, amber-coated and patterned with black flames, one of the most beautiful of creatures.Consider the tiger, how he is formed. With claws up to four inches long and retractable, like a domestic cat's, and carnassial teeth that shatter bone. While able to achieve bursts above 35 miles an hour, the tiger is built for strength, not sustained speed. Short, powerful legs propel his trademark lethal lunge and fabled leaps. Recently, a tiger was captured on video jumping—flying—from flat ground to 13 feet in the air to attack a ranger riding an elephant. The eye of the tiger is backlit by a membrane that reflects light through the retina, the secret of his famous night vision and glowing night eyes. The roar of the tiger—Aaaaauuuunnnn!—can carry more than a mile.For weeks I had been traveling through some of the best tiger habitat in Asia, from remote forests to tropical woodlands and, on a previous trip, to mangrove swamps—but never before had I seen a tiger. Partly this was because of the animal's legendarily secretive nature. The tiger is powerful enough to kill and drag prey five times its weight, yet it can move through high grass, forest, and even water in unnerving silence. The common refrain of those who have witnessed—or survived—an attack is that the tiger "came from nowhere."But the other reason for the dearth of sightings is that the ideal tiger landscapes have very few tigers. The tiger has been a threatened species for most of my lifetime, and its rareness has come to be regarded matter-of-factly, as an intrinsic, defining attribute, like its dramatic coloring. The complacent view that the tiger will continue to be "rare" or "threatened" into the foreseeable future is no longer tenable. In the early 21st century, tigers in the wild face the black abyss of annihilation. "This is about making decisions as if we're in an emergency room," says Tom Kaplan, co-founder of Panthera, an organization dedicated to big cats. "This is it."The tiger's enemies are well-known: Loss of habitat exacerbated by exploding human populations, poverty—which induces poaching of prey animals—and looming over all, the dark threat of the brutal Chinese black market for tiger parts. Less acknowledged are botched conservation strategies that for decades have failed the tiger. The tiger population, dispersed among Asia's 13 tiger countries, is estimated at fewer than 4,000 animals, though many conservationists believe there are hundreds less than that. To put this number in perspective: Global alarm for the species was first sounded in 1969, and early in the '80s it was estimated that some 8,000 tigers remained in the wild. So decades of vociferously expressed concern for tigers—not to mention millions of dollars donated by well-meaning individuals—has achieved the demise of perhaps half of the already imperiled population.My determination to see a wild tiger in my lifetime brought me to Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, one of 40 in India. My first tiger was spotted within ten minutes, and in a four-day excursion I gloried in nine sightings, including a repeat appearance of that first tiger, a three-year-old female. In high grass she stalked with such patient, focused, deliberateness—each paw raised in slow motion and placed so very gently down—that it was possible to see her stealth.It didn't matter that in most cases my experience was shared with a queue of other vehicles. Seeing tigers in the wild is now mostly a tourist experience—the Bengal tiger is not only India's national animal but also one of the country's largest draws. Elsewhere, my tiger-seeking travels had been made on rough roads, by river, forest trails, and even elephant, but in Ranthambore I departed at dawn in a jeep that awaited me outside the Oberoi lodge. In the jeep were a ranger, a guide, and most necessary in a place where tiger viewing is a blood sport, an expert driver, who barged ruthlessly to the head of the queue, ensuring me of that first, mystical tiger sighting.India is home to some 50 percent of the world's wild tigers. The 2010 census reported a maximum estimate of 1,909 in the country—up 20 percent from the previous estimate. While welcome news, most authorities regard the new figure as reflecting better census methods rather than growth of the tiger population: Tiger counts, in India or elsewhere, are still at best only estimates.A modest 41 of these carefully enumerated tigers were living in Ranthambore. Conducting me through the park one morning, conservator Raghuvir Singh Shekhawat pointed out the variety of wildlife that flourishes where the tiger is protected—langur monkeys, spotted deer, wild boars, collared Scops-owls, kingfishers, and parakeets. And he offered a ground-level glimpse of tiger conservation, stopping his jeep beside a canvas tent in a clearing. "Would you like to see the hard life the field officers lead?" he asked, lifting a tent flap to reveal three slender cots. "Here is their kitchen," he said, gesturing to a pile of canned food and bowls. "In 30 years of service, at least five years is under the tent." The rangers put in up to ten miles a day on early morning foot patrol, taking plaster casts of any pugmarks they encounter and making notes of evidence of prey animals.Ranthambore's history reflects in miniature the history of the tiger in India. Formerly the private hunting estate of the maharajas of Jaipur, its original 109-square-mile core reserve is ringed by a containing wall, within which undulating forest skirts romantic maharaja-era ruins. One evening I met with Fateh Singh Rathore, the assistant field director of Ranthambore after it became one of India's first Project Tiger reserves in 1973. Tiger hunting was legal in India until the early 1970s, and as a young man, in the days when Ranthambore had been a hunting estate, he had worked as a game warden. "To shoot a tiger, maybe a hundred rupees," he recalled—a couple of dollars.Always fragile, tiger populations have fluctuated in recent years. Between 2002 and 2004, poaching of some 20 tigers in Ranthambore essentially halved its population. This was better than the fate of the nearby 300-square-mile Sariska Tiger Reserve, found to have no tigers at all: Every single one of its tigers had been killed by professional gangs—and in a reserve just 70 miles from India's capital, New Delhi.Ranthambore is a hub for a contentious new conservation strategy—the relocation of "surplus" tigers to places like Sariska. Only days before, at a wildlife conference in New Delhi, I had heard heated criticism and questions from India's many outspoken watchdog organizations challenging the strategy: What constitutes a surplus tiger? Had the issues in Sariska and elsewhere been solved before importing new tigers? What research had been conducted regarding potential trauma to both the transported tiger and the home population from which it was taken? And what effect might such trauma have on breeding?So far, relocation has met with uneven success. Three tigers transported to Sariska were found to be siblings—undesirable for breeding. More eloquent than any of the valid scientific concerns was a story unfolding in the national media: The determined trek toward his home 250 miles away by a lone male removed from Pench Tiger Reserve to restock Panna National Park.The trek of this solitary tiger highlights another crisis. Many reserves exist as islands of fragile habitat in a vast sea of humanity, yet tigers can range over a hundred miles, seeking prey, mates, and territory. An unwelcome revelation of the new census is that nearly a third of India's tigers live outside tiger reserves, a situation that is dangerous for both human and animal. Prey and tigers can only disperse if there are recognized corridors of land between protected areas to allow unmolested passage. No less critical, such passages serve as genetic corridors, essential to the long-term survival of the species.It is a heady experience to see an idealistic map of Asia's tiger landscapes linked by arteries of these not-yet-existent corridors. A spiderweb of green tendrils weaves tantalizingly among core populations to form a network that encompasses breathtaking extremes of habitat—Himalayan foothills, jungle, swamp, deciduous forest, grasslands—that pay tribute to the tiger's adaptability. Close scrutiny breaks the spell. The places that have actual tigers—here-and-now, flesh-and-blood tigers—as opposed to hypothetical tigers, are represented by a scattering of mustard-colored blobs. The master plan represents a visionary undertaking, but is it feasible? Over the next decade, infrastructure projects—the kind of development that often destroys habitat—are projected to average some $750 billion a year in Asia."I've never met a head of state who says, 'Look, we're a poor country, if it comes between tigers and people, you just have to write off tigers,'" said Alan Rabinowitz, a renowned authority on tigers and the CEO of Panthera. "The governments don't want to lose their most majestic animal. They consider it part of what makes their country what it is, part of the cultural heritage. They won't sacrifice a lot to save it, but if they can see a way to save it, they will usually do it."Seeing a way has proved difficult amid the plethora of tiger strategies, programs, and initiatives jostling for attention—and funding. The U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Save the Tiger Fund (which has now partnered with Panthera), Global Tiger Patrol, Saving Wild Tigers, All for Tigers!, WWF, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Panthera, International Year of the Tiger Foundation, the National Geographic Society's Big Cats Initiative—the list is impressive. "Five to six million dollars is spent a year for tigers, from all philanthropic organizations," said Mahendra Shrestha, former director of the Save the Tiger Fund, which gave grants totaling more than $17 million between 1995 and 2009. "In many instances the NGOs and tiger-range governments just fight each other."Long-term conservation must focus on all aspects of a tiger landscape: core breeding populations, inviolate sanctuaries, wildlife corridors, and the surrounding human communities. In an ideal world, all would be funded; as it is, different agencies adopt different strategies for different components. With time running out, tough priorities must be set. "Since the 1990s, there has been what I would sum up as mission drift," said Ullas Karanth of the WCS, who is one of the world's most respected tiger biologists. The drift toward tiger conservation activities like eco-development and social programs, which possibly have greater fund-raising appeal than antipoaching patrols, siphons funds and energy from the single most vital task: safeguarding core breeding populations of tigers. "If these are lost," Karanth said, "you will have tiger landscapes with no tigers."Decades of experience and failures have yielded a conservation strategy that, according to Rabinowitz, "allows any site or landscape to increase its tigers if followed correctly." Central to this protocol are relentless, systematic, boots-on-the-ground patrolling and monitoring of both tiger and prey in those sites assessed as harboring realistically defensible core tiger populations. Under the protocol, a population of a mere half dozen breeding females can rebound. Such, at least, is the hope for the largest single protected tiger reserve on Earth, a remote valley in northern Myanmar.My first encounter with the Hukawng Valley Wildlife Sanctuary is not heartening. Arriving at the sprawling settlement of Tanaing in northern Myanmar, I scan with bewilderment the large and cheerful market; the bus stops, generators, and telephone posts; the bustling stalls and restaurants—all lodged within the sanctuary borders.Conspicuous bites have been taken from the generous buffer zone that embraces the 2,500-square-mile original wildlife sanctuary. Land for a 200,000-acre cassava plantation has been razed and burned so quickly that the diminishment of the forest could be charted not over weeks but days. The gold-mining settlement of Shingbwiyang in the west, where the land has been stripped raw and mountain rivers turned to mud, is home to some 50,000 migrants, and permanent concrete structures and power lines have sprung up among the rudimentary huts of thatch and wood. The rebel Kachin Independence Army controls the reserve's eastern edge.Yet the sheer size of the 6,708-square-mile tiger reserve can accommodate even these intrusions. Cupped between three mountain ranges, the Hukawng Valley is defined by dense, dark, seemingly boundless jungle. As recently as the 1970s Hukawng villagers encountered tigers in the course of ordinary rural life, hearing their roars at night. Rarely did a tiger harm a human, their victims typically being livestock or cattle. Still, the fearsome potential of the world's largest cat inspired sufficient respect to enshrine the tiger in local mythologies. Among the Naga tribespeople in northwestern Hukawng, stories of tiger shamans still abound. Tigers were Rum Hoi Khan—the King of the Forest, with whom man had a thitsar, a natural bond or treaty. "Naga used to call male tigers Grandfather, and female tigers Grandma," an elderly Naga man told me. "They believe they are their ancestors."Such beliefs are fading with the tigers, recalled now only by the elderly. Myanmar youth know the tiger more from educational conservation stories than from life. The Myanmar Forest Department, for instance, sponsors a mobile education team that tours villages performing a skit about a tiger killed by a wicked poacher. The grief of the tiger "widow" reportedly moves all the women in the audience to tears. There is perhaps no more eloquent testimony to the tiger's imperiled status than this adjustment of its mythology from Rum Hoi Khan to weeping widow.Two days after arriving in Tanaing, I joined the Myanmar Forest Department's Flying Tiger and guard teams as they headed up the Ta­wang River to the Forward Guard Post. The sun had burned off the morning mist, and the river flowed glacial blue under the hard blue sky. Close to shore, banana groves cast green shade on the water. Flocks of mergansers skimmed ahead and waited, while an occasional white-bellied heron sailed by. Hukawng Valley has elephants and clouded leopards, gaur (an ox), and sambar (an Asian deer)—favorite tiger prey; and it has a still unsatisfactorily assessed scattering of tigers.Upriver, at the Forward Guard Post, a rattan-and-wood house on stilts in a clearing by the water, the head ranger, Zaw Win Khaing, gave an overview of the teams' survey work for the current season. The tiger team spent a third of each month on patrol, looking for tracks or scat of tigers, along with evidence of prey animals such as sambar, gaur, and wild pig. Rangers looked for evidence of human activities. In the previous month they had disbanded a hunter's camp and dispersed or apprehended 34 people involved in land clearing and cultivation, mostly for opium poppies.Saw Htoo Tha Po, who bore the attractive title of tiger coordinator and is a seasoned veteran of this tough field, described the patrols. "Sometimes if it is sunny, you can see the sky," he said, conjuring what it was like to operate under triple-canopy forest for up to six weeks. The worst days are when it rains, and the trees spill water from their saucerlike leaves, and dripping mists chill the bone. Then the leeches get bigger and "make more blood." The local strain of malaria is particularly vicious and has killed team members. In all, 74 forest department personnel and wildlife police officers, in rotation, are responsible for patrolling a 700-square-mile strategic area of dense forest.The head ranger, Zaw Win Khaing, once saw a tiger, in 2002. He had sat down to measure bear tracks in a muddy wallow when he saw something move to his right. As he stood up, the tiger's face appeared from the grass. "It was about as close as that chili plant," the ranger said, pointing to a vegetable plot some 15 feet away. "I do not know how long I looked at the tiger, because I was trembling." Eventually, the tiger turned back toward the forest.By authoritative estimate, there may be 25 tigers in the Hukawng Valley—the authority in this case being an old Lisu tribesman not long retired from tiger poaching, who from time to time agreeably shares information with the tiger teams. Official, scientific evidence of the tigers' existence is harder to come by. In 2006-07 the only trace was several paw prints of a single tiger, and in the 2007-08 season, DNA tests of collected scat indicated the presence of three tigers.This season a clean line of pugmarks by the river was cause for both celebration and a SWAT-team-worthy follow-up: News of the discovery was radioed in at 8 a.m., and by 6 p.m. the tiger team had arrived from Tanaing. Measurements and plaster casts of the tracks were made over a five-day period, and three camera traps were placed in the area, which had so far yielded only a picture of a pied hornbill. About the same time, fresh tracks were discovered nine miles upriver, which proved to belong to the same tiger. This, then, was payoff for another hard field season—a line of tiger paw prints in the pale yellow sand.Later I spoke with Alan Rabinowitz, whose decade-long work with the Myanmar Forest Department lay behind the creation of the Hukawng Sanctuary. Was the expenditure of so much effort justified for so few tigers? As part of his answer, he pointed to a map that showed Hukawng's key position in the northern web of tiger landscapes. "Hukawng's potential is so huge," he countered. And he had witnessed habitats that had been turned around. "Huai Kha Khaeng was in terrible shape when I was there in the 1990s, and now it's one of Asia's best tiger reserves.""I first worked here in 1986, when every night there were gunshot noises, every day dead animals," Alan Rabinowitz told the group of 40 rangers, the team leaders who represented the park's 170 ranger personnel, gathered at the headquarters of the 1,073-square-mile Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand. The ravaged landscape Rabinowitz described was one his audience could no longer recognize—Huai Kha Khaeng as it had been a mere two and a half decades ago. "What you have done here," Rabinowitz said, "is you have turned Huai Kha Khaeng from a site whose future was in grave doubt into one of the world's best tiger sites."Two decades ago, perhaps 20 tigers roamed Huai Kha Khaeng. There are now an estimated 60 in the sanctuary alone and roughly 100 in the rest of the Western Forest Complex, which has six times the area. The improved health of the forest and the rise in prey (50 animals, or 6,600 pounds of living prey a year for each tiger, is a general rule) suggest that the tiger population could continue to accelerate upward.The feasibility of bringing tigers back from the razor's edge of survival relies not only on human actions in the immediate future but also on the tiger's own remarkably resilient nature. Tigers are not finicky about diet or habitat or, like the panda, dependent on a particular ecosystem. Tiger tracks have been found in Bhutan above 13,000 feet, an altitude overlapping the domain of the snow leopard, while tigers in the saltwater mangrove swamps of the Bangladeshi and Indian Sundarbans are powerful swimmers and have learned to supplement their diets with marine life. And tigers reproduce well if given a chance. An average female can rear some six to eight cubs over her 10- to 12-year lifespan—which helped a population like that at Huai Kha Khaeng triple in 20 years.Dedicated, by-the-book monitoring at Huai Kha Khaeng gave tigers a fighting chance, and the animals responded. At the ranger meeting I watched each of the 20 patrol leaders step up and make a ten-minute report of his team's work. Multimedia presentations showed maps of the patrol area, specific paths followed, man-days spent in each, and locations of trouble spots. No less revealing were images that showed interest beyond the call of duty—photographs rangers had taken of flowers in the forest loam, footage of a lone ant dragging the body of a lizard spread-eagled like a fallen warrior. Rare footage of a mother Asian tapir leading her cub across a river drew murmurs of appreciation from the audience. Burning interest and personal investment, professional pride, motivation, high morale—all were manifest in this room. In so many tiger landscapes, rangers make do with threadbare clothes and third-generation equipment, but the rangers of Huai Kha Khaeng were dressed in smart camouflage uniforms that flagged their status as members of a respected profession."Thailand's biggest asset is a national guarantee of salaries, the commitment of the national government," one conservationist told me. The operating budget for Huai Kha Khaeng's 2008-09 season amounted to $670,000, two-thirds paid by the Thai government, and the remaining third coming from WCS, the U.S. government, and various international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This covered office management, species monitoring, training, wildlife-trade monitoring, camera traps, and most important, 30,600 man-days of patrols.Following the meeting I joined Anak Pattanavibool, director of WCS's Thailand Program; Rabinowitz; and a tracker named Kwanchai Waitanyakan for a walk in the forest. Far below the canopy, we threaded through towering bamboo. Twice we stopped to listen to the low, husky call of an elephant. After a few miles, we broke out onto the clear-flowing Huai Tab Salao stream. On the opposite bank we found a long line of tiger tracks, four inches wide, striding confidently amid the bird scratches and lily-pad prints left by elephants."Lean all your weight on your hands," Rabinowitz instructed. Then he measured the depth of the impression my hand made in the sand. "One and a half centimeters," he announced—just over half an inch. The tiger's pugmark was an inch and a half deep. This, Pattanavibool estimated, was a male weighing more than 400 pounds.In tiger landscapes outside India, most rangers have seen poachers but not tigers, and the hard days and nights they sweat in malarial forest or under canvas are for something they may never see. Even in Huai Kha Khaeng, tigers are less likely to be seen by foot patrols than captured by the roughly 180 camera traps that hold selected areas of the forest under eerie surveillance. Displayed at the sanctuary's wildlife research station were images of tigers caught in all their secret ways—eyes glaring blue and luminescent in the dark, tigers lounging majestically on a bed of leaves under shafts of sunlight, a full-whiskered stare into the lens, or just the tip of a tail.The goal in Huai Kha Khaeng is to increase the population by 50 percent, to 90 tigers, and eventually to 720 in the entire Western Forest Complex. This prompts more heady speculation: If the tiger population of one well-managed park could be increased threefold in 20 years …"There is 1.1 million square kilometers of tiger habitat remaining," said Eric Dinerstein, chief scientist and vice president of conservation science of the WWF. "Assuming two tigers for every 100 square kilometers, that's a potential 22,000 tigers."For now the unnegotiable task is to save the few tigers that actually exist. And the story of the tiger's fate is relentlessly swift-moving. The Year of the Tiger, the celebration of which, in 2010, was the number one objective of a lauded tiger workshop in Kathmandu, has come and gone with no discernible benefit to the world's wild tigers. In November 2010 the 13 tiger countries attending the St. Petersburg Global Tiger Summit in Russia pledged to "strive to double the number of wild tigers across their range by 2022." In March 2010 a mother and two cubs were poisoned in Huai Kha Khaeng, the first poaching casualties in four years. The deaths prompted the Thai government to offer a $3,000 bounty for capture of the poachers. In the same month two young tigers were poisoned in Ranthambore, apparently by villagers who had lost goats to tiger attacks, while two new cubs were later born. And in Hukawng a new male tiger was caught by camera trap, a lone reminder of what this great wilderness could hold.Most authorities agree that the fight to save the tiger can be won—but that it must be waged with unremitting professional focus that adheres to a proven strategy. It will require the human species to display not merely resolve but out­right zealotry."I want it in my will," Fateh Singh Rathore had told me in Ranthambore, his eyes burning bright behind his spectacles. "When I die, you spread my ashes on these grounds so the tiger can walk upon my ashes."",
"All across the nation, in Americans’ backyards and garages and living rooms, in their beds and basements and bathrooms, wild animals kept as pets live side by side with their human owners. It’s believed that more exotic animals live in American homes than are cared for in American zoos. The exotic-pet business is a lucrative industry, one that’s drawn criticism from animal welfare advocates and wildlife conservationists alike. These people say it’s not only dangerous to bring captive-bred wildlife into the suburbs, but it’s cruel and it ought to be criminal too. Yet the issue is far from black or white.At least not to Leslie-Ann Rush, a horse trainer who lives on a seven-acre farm outside Orlando, Florida, a place where the wind makes a rustling sound when it whips through the palms. Rush, 57, who has a kind face and hair the color of corn, breeds and trains gypsy horses she houses in a barn behind her small petting zoo, a wire enclosure where three male kangaroos, four lemurs, a muntjac deer (originally from Asia), a potbellied pig, a raccoon-like kinkajou called Kiwi, and a dog named Dozer all live—the lemurs leaping freely, the kangaroos sleeping on their sides, the petite pig rooting in the ground, the Asian deer balancing its rack of antlers on its delicate head.Rush weaves in and around her exotic pets with ease and cheerfulness and Cheerios, doling them out to the lemurs. They thrust their humanlike hands into the open boxes and draw out fistfuls of O’s, which they eat almost politely, one by one, dining daintily while the drool gathers in the corners of their mouths.Rush has a ring-tailed lemur, Liam; two ruffed lemurs, Lolli and Poppi; and a common brown lemur named Charlie. While many lemurs are threatened, the ruffed lemurs are considered critically endangered in the wild. Rush believes that by caring for these captive-bred creatures she is doing her part to help keep lemurs alive on Earth, and she cares for her animals with a profound commitment that consumes her days and even her nights. As darkness falls, she moves from the small enclosure into her home and takes her favorite lemur with her; he shares her bed, coiled up on a pillow by her head.Because kangaroos are active typically at dawn and dusk, the animals look lazy in the daylight, dun-colored beasts lying on their sides in cylinders of sun, their thick tails trailing in the dry dirt. But come evening they hop up on their hind legs and press their faces against the large glass window, looking in on Rush in her home: Let me come in, they seem to say. Rush does not let them in, although she did when they were babies. “I have all of these amazing animals of different species, from different continents, and the thing is, they play together,” she says, and she sweeps her hand through the air, gesturing to her multicolored menagerie sunning, sleeping, snacking. She has filmed and posted videos of them playing on YouTube, the lemurs leaping over the kangaroos, which hop and twirl and chase the primates around the yard.Despite occasional reports of wild kangaroos attacking humans in Australia, Rush’s pets display not a hint of aggression. This may have something to do with the fact that kangaroos are naturally somnolent during daytime hours, and it may also have something to do with the fact that Rush’s kangaroos are no longer truly wild: They were bred in captivity; two of them have been neutered; they are used to human contact. Rush raised each kangaroo in diapers, bottle-fed it, and, touching the sleek suede fur continually, accustomed each animal to human hands.The $35 that Rush charges to visit what she calls her Exotic Animal Experience helps defray the costs involved in keeping her pets. Some exotic-animal owners spend thousands a year on fresh meat, for carnivores that dine daily on raw steak, for primates—omnivores with complex dietary needs—for snakes, which eat rat after rat after rat. In Rush’s case her kangaroos consume huge quantities of grain, while the lemurs eat mounds of fruits and vegetables.Rush herself lives a lean life, much of her own money poured into feeding her herd. And then there’s her time. She puts abundant hours into caring for her exotics. “They’re 24/7,” she says, and then goes on to add, “but they’re my family. They need me. I can’t explain to you what that feels like. I wake up every morning and come out here, and all my animals come rushing up to greet me. I feel loved, and that feels great.“My family,” she repeats, and a shadow sweeps across her face. “All my life,” she says, “people have let me down. My animals never have.”Privately owning exotic animals is currently permitted in a handful of states with essentially no restrictions: You must have a license to own a dog, but you are free to purchase a lion or baboon and keep it as a pet. Even in the states where exotic-pet ownership is banned, “people break the law,” says Adam Roberts of Born Free USA, who keeps a running database of deaths and injuries attributed to exotic-pet ownership: In Texas a four-year-old mauled by a mountain lion his aunt kept as a pet, in Connecticut a 55-year-old woman’s face permanently disfigured by her friend’s lifelong pet chimpanzee, in Ohio an 80-year-old man attacked by a 200-pound kangaroo, in Nebraska a 34-year-old man strangled to death by his pet snake. And that list does not capture the number of people who become sick from coming into contact with zoonotic diseases.The term exotic pet has no firm definition; it can refer to any wildlife kept in human households—or simply to a pet that’s more unusual than the standard dog or cat. Lack of oversight and regulation makes it difficult to pin down just how many exotics are out there. “The short answer is, too many,” says Patty Finch of the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. It’s estimated that the number of captive tigers alone is at least 5,000—most kept not by accredited zoos but by private owners. And while many owners tend to their exotic pets with great care and at no small expense, some keep their pets in cramped cages and poor conditions.Commercially importing endangered species into the United States has been restricted since the early 1970s. Many of the large exotic animals that end up in backyard menageries—lions and tigers, monkeys and bears—are bred in captivity. Today on the Internet you can find zebras and camels and cougars and capuchins for sale, their adorable faces staring out from your screen; the monkeys with their intelligent eyes; the big cats with their tawny coats. And though such animals are no longer completely wild, neither are they domesticated—they exist in a netherworld that prompts intriguing questions and dilemmas.From his experience in providing sanctuary for exotic animals in need of new homes, often desperately, Roberts says that exotic-pet owners tend to fall into multiple overlapping categories. Some people treat their animals, especially primates, as surrogate children, dressing them up in baby clothes, diapering them, and training them to use the toilet. Some own exotics as symbols of status and power, the exotic animal the next step up from a Doberman or pitbull. There are impulse buyers who simply could not resist purchasing a cute baby exotic. Still others are collectors, like Brandon Terry, who lives in Wake County, North Carolina, in a one-bedroom apartment with 15 snakes, three of them venomous. And then there are wild animal lovers who may start out as volunteers at a wildlife sanctuary and end up adopting a rescued animal in need of a home.Denise Flores of Ohio explains how she acquired her first tiger. “I went to a wild animal park one day, and someone put a baby tiger in my lap. My heart melted; it just melted. I was hooked,” says Flores, who ended up caring for eight rescued big cats, including two white tigers so beautiful they looked like fluid ivory.Some people seek wild animals as pets as a way to reconnect with the natural world. They believe their exotics set them apart, the relationship made all the more intense by the unintended social isolation that is often the result of having an unpredictable beast as a companion. “Yes, of course my exotics make me feel unique,” Rush says. Though anyone can own a cat or dog, exotic-pet owners take pleasure in possessing an animal that has, for hundreds of thousands of years, refused the saddle of domestication: They take the uncivilized into society and in doing so assert their power.“I wanted something different, something unusual,” says Michelle Berk, formerly of Palisades, Florida, who bought her kinkajou, Winnie, on craigslist. “She was there for me to make my own. We didn’t get a dog because there’s nothing cool or outstanding about owning a dog. A kinkajou—now that seems untouchable. And who doesn’t want the untouchable? They say don’t touch it, so you want to touch it.”Tim Harrison understands the allure of owning exotic pets. Thirty-two years ago he worked as a public safety officer in the city of Oakwood, Ohio, and kept a menagerie in his house. He had snakes wrapped around lamp poles. He had rhesus monkeys leaping from counter to couch. He had lions sunning themselves on his gravel driveway. He had capuchins and bears and wolves, which were his favorites.After a hard day of chasing criminals or a boring day of ticketing cars, Harrison would change out of his uniform and drive home to his animals. He always went to the wolves first. His body aching, his mind numbed, he’d let the canines come to him, weaving around his legs. He’d drop down on his knees and then lie flat on his back, the wolves clambering over him. “I would just lie there and let them lick me,” Harrison says, “and it was one of the best feelings in the world.”Now the animals are gone. Harrison will never again own anything wild or exotic. He believes ownership of all potentially dangerous exotic animals should be banned and is working to make that happen. He underwent a profound transformation, his entire outlook shattered and put back together again in a new way.What happened is this: After decades of being an exotic-pet owner, Harrison went to Africa. He drove over the open plains and grasslands, and he can remember, all these years later, the giraffes’ long lope, the lions’ hypnotic canter, the elephants sucking water up their trunks and spraying themselves so their hides glistened. Harrison gazed upon these wild animals, and he says it was as if his eyes had been blistered shut and were suddenly opened as he witnessed these mammals moving in such profound harmony with their environment that you could hear it: a rhythm, a pulse, a roar. This, Harrison suddenly realized, was how wild animals are supposed to live. They are not supposed to live in Dayton or any other suburb or city; they are creatures in and of the land, and to give them anything less suddenly seemed wrong.Harrison says he understood then that he didn’t really own wild animals. What he had back in Dayton was a mixed-up menagerie of inbreeding and crossbreeding that resulted in animals that had almost nothing to do with the creatures before him now. He felt that he’d been no better than a warden and that he needed to change his ways. When he returned to Ohio, one by one he gave up his beloved wolves and primates and cats and handed them over to sanctuaries where they’d at least have safety and space. It hurt him to do this. He knew his wolves so well he could howl a hello, and a goodbye.Today Harrison is retired from the police force. He puts as many hours as he can into Outreach for Animals, an organization he helped found to rescue exotic pets and place them in one of the sanctuaries he trusts. Many of the so-called wildlife sanctuaries in this country are actually using their animals to make a profit, commercially breeding them or allowing public contact. The few that operate solely for the benefit of the animals are already overloaded, says Vernon Weir of the American Sanctuary Association, an accrediting organization. “I have trouble finding space for wolf-dog mixes, potbellied pigs, some species of monkeys—many retired from use in research—and all the big cats and bears,” Weir says. “A good sanctuary will take in only what they can afford to care for.”Harrison’s agency fields hundreds of calls a month from law enforcement officials dealing with an escaped animal or owners overwhelmed by the cost and responsibility of an animal’s care. He has been on more than a hundred big cat rescues in the past year and over his lifetime has rescued close to a thousand exotic felines. He was there when a man in Pike County, Ohio, named Terry Brumfield finally agreed to give up his beloved but ill-kept lions. He is currently working with a man who owns a bear that bit off his finger. The owner can’t yet bring himself to let the bear go.“I meet people where they’re at,” says Harrison. “If an owner isn’t ready to give their exotic up, I help them care for the animal in the best way possible. I help them build a better enclosure or get the best kind of feed. I don’t judge. My hope is that, with the right kind of support, the person will eventually see that owning this animal is a dangerous drain and will voluntarily choose to give it up.”Harrison feels empathy for wild animal owners, whose affection he so well understands. He loved his animals. He believed, as most owners do, that his animals loved him. He believed that having a thriving menagerie made him special. “But I was deluded,” he says. “I used to believe there was no animal I could not tame, no animal I was unable to train, and that any animal living under my roof was receiving the best of care.” The delusion, rooted in a deep desire to commune with wild animals, has lingered long after the beasts were gone. Every time he participates in a rescue he has to stop himself from taking the animal home. “I try to keep my contact with the animals I rescue to a minimum,” Harrison explains, “because my addiction can come back at a moment’s notice.”The state of Ohio has become ground zero for the debate over exotic-animal ownership, and here’s why: In October 2011, outside the city of Zanesville, in Muskingum County, a man named Terry Thompson let 50 of his wild animals, including lions and tigers, out of their cages and enclosures before killing himself. The local sheriff’s department had little choice but to shoot most of the animals, which were dodging cars, loping across backyards, and posing a threat to public safety. Prior to the Zanesville incident, Ohio was one of a handful of states that required no license or permit to keep an exotic or wild animal as a pet.The Zanesville tragedy woke Ohio up. In response to the outcry over the sight of exotic carcasses lined up near Thompson’s property, the governor of Ohio signed an executive order cracking down on unlicensed animal auctions. The state now requires owners of “dangerous exotic animals” to have a permit, to microchip their pets, to establish a relationship with a veterinarian, and to buy insurance.“I couldn’t afford the insurance,” Flores says, and so she sent her big cats to live in accredited sanctuaries, which is exactly what state officials hoped would happen. “These are beautiful animals, yes, but let me tell you,” says Flores, “I had the common sense to know to never get in the cage with them. I’d pet them through the bars, if that. That was all.”Sheriff Matthew Lutz was the one who gave the order to shoot the animals after Thompson released them from their cages. The incident continues to haunt him. He has joined forces with animal rights activists who have lobbied for years, to no effect so far, for a federal law that would prohibit the private possession and breeding of large cats except by zoos and other registered facilities.Like Rush, many exotic-pet owners and private breeders say they are motivated by a desire to preserve and protect threatened species. “Climate change and human population growth could wipe out a species in record time, so having a backup population is a good idea,” says Lynn Culver, a private breeder of felines and executive director of the Feline Conservation Federation who believes that “those who do it right should have the right to do it.”But advocacy groups like Born Free USA and the World Wildlife Fund say that captive breeding of endangered species by private owners—whether for commercial, conservation, or educational reasons—serves only to perpetuate a thriving market for exotic animals. That, in turn, results in a greater risk to animals still living in their natural habitat. Conservation efforts should focus on protecting animals in the wild, they assert, not on preserving what are often inbred animals in private zoos.If a federal law ever passes, violators could face a fine and time in jail, as well as have their animal confiscated. That prospect enrages some exotic-animal owners, who argue that the number of incidents involving injuries from exotic pets pales in comparison to the number of people who visit the emergency room for dog bites each year.“Placing bans on wild animal ownership will only increase the population of illegal exotics out there,” says Zuzana Kukol, who co-founded REXANO (Responsible Exotic Animal Ownership) to oppose bans on the private ownership or use of animals. “Bans do not work. We’ve seen this with alcohol and prostitution.”Kukol and co-founder Scott Shoemaker live on ten acres of land an hour’s drive from Death Valley, in the state of Nevada. They own two bobcats, two African lions, two cougars, four tigers, one serval, and one ocelot. They point out that wild animal ownership has existed throughout history and in all cultures—“by monarchs, kings, monks, nomads, and peasants”—and insist that most owners today treat their animals well and keep them from harming people. When it comes to risk and its management, she is very clear: “I’d rather die by a lion than by some stupid drunk driver.”Local people, including farmers, give the couple their ailing cows and horses, which Shoemaker kills with a simple gunshot to the head, then butchers into small pieces and feeds to the menagerie, including Kukol’s favorite pet, a male African lion named Bam Bam. She has always gravitated more toward animals than people. “Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to surround myself with animals,” she says. “I never wanted children.”It’s true that even in states where wild animal ownership is explicitly banned, existing laws are not well enforced. The market for exotics is so alive and thriving that to call it underground is a bit misleading. “The worst offenders are the tiger petting zoos that churn out 200 cubs a year so people can have their picture taken with them,” says Carole Baskin of Big Cat Rescue, an accredited sanctuary.At the raucous auctions held in muddy fields or paved parking lots, auctioneers hold out adorable tiger cubs with scrumptious soft scruffs or display tiny chimps in baseball hats and T-shirts that say, “I (heart) you.” But people don’t realize that all too soon that adorable tiger will outgrow its role as family pet and end up confined in a chain link enclosure.It’s backyard breeders that Tim Harrison believes are to blame for most wild animal abuse. He’s been to auctions where cages are stacked one on top of the other, cramped with cougars and other big cats, mostly cubs; the tents awhirl with people whose pockets bulge with cash; snakes and primates being sold for thousands of dollars. The parking lots are filled with everything from shining Cadillacs to rusted trucks, the public pouring in to see and touch.The breeders stand to make hundreds of thousands of dollars during an auction. They coach their auctioneers—the middlemen—to tell prospective buyers that their animals, usually babies, are harmless, and they are correct. “The problem comes,” says Harrison, “when the animal reaches sexual maturity and its natural predator instinct kicks in.”Remember Michelle Berk and her kinkajou? Like so many other wild animal stories, Winnie’s came to a sad end. For years Berk kept the kinkajou in peace, but when the animal went into her first heat, her behavior changed. She tried to eat her own tail as Berk and her family tried to protect themselves while stopping the kinkajou from tearing herself to pieces. After that Berk turned Winnie over to a sanctuary. “It’s like we lost a child. She’ll always be our baby. Now she has gone to a place where she’ll finally get to be a kinkajou,” says Berk, who seems at peace with the decision. “I’ve learned that Winnie never really needed us. She didn’t need to be our pet. She didn’t need to be locked up. We got her because we needed her.”So yes, the infant animals are docile, but docile is different from domesticated. Of all the large land mammals that populate the planet, just over a dozen have been successfully domesticated. No matter how tamed or accustomed to humans an undomesticated animal becomes, its wild nature is still intact.When making the case against exotic-pet ownership, animal rights advocates tend to highlight the dangers these formerly wild creatures pose to humans; wild animal owners underscore the inherent rights of humans to own exotics. Back and forth the argument goes, but what can get lost is what’s best for the animals. If only it were possible to look at the issue from the animal’s point of view.Yet perhaps we need only look more closely, with our own human eyes, at even a model example of responsible wild animal ownership. Here we are, back at the ranch owned by Leslie-Ann Rush, the marsupials still snoozing in the sun, the pig still rooting in the earth, the fruit trees heavy with papayas.In all ways Rush has done a fantastic job. The enclosure where she keeps her animals is clean. Despite the financial pressures, they are well fed and content. She is 100 percent committed and, on top of that, has managed to carve out for herself a life that suits her, a sustaining interdependent community of breathing beings, and this is no small thing.Like most exotic owners I spoke with, Rush does not believe her animals pose a danger to herself or anyone else. “I don’t have predators,” she says. “I’m not that kind of wild animal owner.” But perhaps danger to humans is not really the point.A rabbit runs through the yard, a newcomer, or simply suddenly visible. The potbellied pig sniffs and snorts. One kangaroo lifts a lazy eyelid and then lowers it and starts to slumber again. Only the youngest kangaroo is awake, and now, suddenly, he perks up. His ears fork forward and his eyes take on a sheen.Hauling himself up on his hind legs, he sniffs the pig’s mottled hide as it trots by, then starts to hop behind the animal, lowering his pointed nose to get a whiff of the pig’s rear. The pig turns around and snarls. The kangaroo, the youngest one, which hasn’t been neutered, doesn’t seem to understand the meaning of the snarl—why would he, since he’s been raised to comprehend not animal but human language—and continues to pursue the pig, which picks up speed. The kangaroo is now in hot pursuit, trying to mount the pig.“Look!” Rush says. “They’re playing!” But the animals do not seem to be playing. The pig’s snarl grows more threatening. There is, all of a sudden, in what was a peaceful enclosure, a series of misunderstandings. Although it seems evident to me that the kangaroo is trying to mate with the pig, Rush later tells me it was grooming. Whatever is happening, the pig is having no part of it and trots away as fast as his little legs will go. Of course, a kangaroo cannot successfully mate with a Vietnamese potbellied pig. Yet here, in this wired enclosure, the natural order has been altered.Adam Roberts of Born Free USA says his organization’s mission is to keep wildlife in the wild, where it belongs. When humans choose to keep what are supposed to be wild animals as pets, we turn them into something outside of wild, something for which nature has no place. In the famous children’s book Where the Wild Things Are, a boy sails on a boat to an island where he dances with beasts born from his own imagination. In the end what we learn from exotic-pet ownership is that when you take the wild out of the wild, you eradicate its true nature and replace it with fantasy—the fantasy being ours, we humans, the animals at once the most and the least tamed of all.",
"This female Nycticebus bengalensis was photographed in 2014 at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center, located in a national park in northern Vietnam. The center rescues and rehabilitates injured and illegally traded animals. When possible, it releases slow lorises into the forested park, some with trackable collars so their reentry can be monitored. Center director Sonya Prosser says this slow loris was released in 2015, and “as far as we know, she is still out there.”After videos of slow lorises being tickled and fed rice balls in captivity swept the Internet, the wide-eyed animals shot to viral fame. The YouTube videos generated thousands of comments about the primate’s adorable looks, but they also highlighted a grievous threat facing slow lorises: demand for them as pets.All species of slow lorises are supposed to be protected by local laws in southern Asia and by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a treaty that aims to prevent trade that could threaten wild species’ survival. Still, countless slow lorises are captured each year from their rain forest habitat and sold online, across borders, or to local wildlife markets.Customers find them irresistible, but these primates don’t fare well as pets. Before they’re sold, most undergo a painful process to remove their sharp teeth—and circumstances don’t improve from there. In a 2016 study, researchers from Oxford Brookes University examined a hundred online videos of pet lorises and concluded that all the animals were distressed, sick, or exposed to unnatural conditions. “They’re quite sensitive,” says Christine Rattel of International Animal Rescue, which runs a slow loris rescue program in Indonesia. “They are nocturnal, small animals that don’t like to be handled.”It’s uncertain how many slow lorises remain in the wild, but conservationists say populations have declined because the pet trade continues to run rampant. Habitat loss also has taken a toll, as has poaching for traditional Asian medicine, which ascribes therapeutic properties to the animals’ body parts. An ongoing pet trade “would really push lorises to the brink of extinction,” Rattel says.They’re hardly the only wildlife facing this threat. Cheetahs, lions, and other famed species end up in basements and backyards, as do lesser known creatures such as the ball python and long-tailed macaque.“The pet trade is probably one of the most devastating parts of the wildlife trade,” says wildlife-trafficking expert Chris Shepherd. But it’s “getting the least amount of attention.”",
"A wild black leopard rests in a tree in Nagarhole National Park, in India. A man in Florida was recently mauled by a captive black leopard, after he paid $150 to enter its cage.In late August, Dwight Turner paid $150 to get inside a cage with a black leopard at a house in Florida. Almost immediately, the leopard attacked, ripping his right ear in half with its teeth and tearing into his head. His wife had to press a dangling flap of his scalp back in place.The incident, which took place at the home of animal dealer Michael Poggi in Davie, Florida, occurred during what was supposed to be a “full-contact experience” with the leopard, in which Turner would rub its belly and take photos with it.The attack is a stark reminder that big cats are dangerous to people—a reality that’s become muddled through the lens of social media. Many big cat owners have shot to fame through Netflix’s hit docuseries Tiger King, and on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram by posting videos of themselves play-wrestling and swimming with their adult tigers and lions, creating a false impression that these encounters are safe.“These are animals whose brains are literally designed to be ambush predators,” says Imogene Cancellare, a National Geographic Explorer and conservation biologist studying snow leopards. “There is no scenario in which entering a [space] with a big cat is going to be 100 percent safe, even if it’s been hand-raised,” she says, as the majority of big cats in roadside and backyard zoos around the country have been.Hand-raised big cats are still genetically wild, and they’ve been conditioned to interact with owners only as a function of being fed by them, she says. “At the end of the day, in my professional opinion, there is nothing you can do to make a tiger or lion or jaguar love you enough to overcome its predatory instincts that can turn on a dime.”After the attack, first reported by Local 10 News in Florida, Turner underwent two surgeries and got 22 staples in his head. He’s still at risk of losing his right ear, according to a report filed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), which investigated the case. Turner intends to file a lawsuit against Poggi, the owner of the leopard, his lawyer told Local 10 News.Poggi did not respond to a National Geographic request for comment by time of publication.He is licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an animal dealer, and he owns the leopard legally. But Florida law prohibits letting a visitor have full contact with a big cat larger than 25 pounds. FWC charged Poggi with “allowing a member of the public full contact with an extremely dangerous full grown black leopard” and “maintaining captive wildlife in an unsafe condition,” according to the police report. Poggi is set to appear in court on December 2 and faces penalties of up to a year and a half in jail, and $1,500 in fines.Federal regulations also state that barriers must exist between the public and big cats 12 weeks or older. For this reason, adult big cat encounters are rare at U.S. roadside zoos. The margin of error in these interactions, says National Geographic Explorer Andrew Stein, founder of CLAWS Conservancy, a nonprofit focused on mitigating human-wildlife conflict, “is the difference between having a safe encounter and possibly dying.”Animal breeder Michael Poggi keeps his black leopard in this cage in the backyard of his Florida home. Dwight Turner, who had pre-arranged the leopard contact experience with Poggi, was attacked by the cat almost immediately after he entered the cage.Nonetheless, these tourist encounters are commonplace in other countries, especially in Southeast Asia, and are normalized by many Insta-famous big cat owners, who interact with their own animals in social media videos.There’s “this Jungle Book-esque romanticism in communing with animals,” says Siobhan Speiran, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies at Queen’s University in Ontario, who has spent the last three years researching social media’s influence on people’s perceptions of wild animals. Popular exotic animal owners like Kody Antle, Kevin “The Lion Whisperer” Richardson, and Eduardo Serio of Black Jaguar White Tiger in Mexico all have acquired millions of followers by regularly posting videos of themselves wrestling with their big cats—like modern-day Mowglis.These posts and videos “create a mythology around animal handlers—especially men,” Speiran says. “The mystique of it all, like, ‘Wow, they have their own lion pride!’” can drive someone to want to do it too, she says, “not realizing that it’s a totally artificial creation. This man isn’t a lion whisperer—it’s completely unnatural.”But people buy into it, wanting to be close to these animal whisperers “like I want to be close to Jane Goodall,” Speiran says, noting that admiration for people who seem to share bonds with animals is probably a universal feeling for any animal lover.The social media worlds these big cat owners create, however, make it difficult for the average person to tell the difference between someone who keeps, breeds, and sells access to exotic wildlife, and a conservationist, like Goodall, who works to save them, she says.Adding to the confusion is the fact that many roadside zoo owners and breeders bill themselves as rescuers or advertise that their businesses help fund conservation. Kody Antle’s family runs a charity that purports to raise money for wild tiger conservation; Poggi describes his business as an animal sanctuary (legitimate sanctuaries typically do not allow public contact with wild animals, according to the Global Federation for Animal Sanctuaries). These are common marketing tactics used in the private zoo industry so customers feel like the money they’re paying to interact with wild animals is helping them.Welfare issues at roadside zoos have been well-documented. In addition to speed-breeding tigers so there are always cubs for tourists to cuddle, some fail to provide adequate food, enclosures, and veterinary care. Just last month, Doc Antle, Kody’s father and the owner of the family’s Myrtle Beach Safari roadside zoo, was charged with wildlife trafficking and animal cruelty. Another Tiger King character, Jeff Lowe, lost his license to exhibit animals after authorities documented numerous cases of animal suffering.“Folks probably think if [private big cat ownership] is really that bad, it would be illegal,” Speiran says. But “animals are, in many ways, the last frontier of social justice.”Cancellare, Speiran, and Stein all say that the Big Cat Public Safety Act, a bill that aims to federally prohibit commercial breeding, public handling, and ownership of big cats as pets, could make a difference in curbing big cat ownership and backyard breeding in the U.S., protecting animals and people alike.Eliminating cub-petting would “put a huge wrench in the demand for a constant supply of privately bred big cats and slow down interactions with adult animals as well—hopefully resulting in fewer articles being put out about maulings,” Cancellare says.The point of these animals’ existence isn’t to be snuggled by people; the point we should be driving home, she says, “is to leave them alone.”",
"When Lauren Gay’s son was little, it wasn’t unusual for him to bring “friends” home in his pocket. “He was the kid who would come home with a salamander,” she recalls with a smile and a shrug. “It happened.”And though she wanted to encourage her son’s love of the outdoors, she still gently explained to him that taking the salamander from its home wasn’t exactly good for the salamander.The inclination to collect seashells at the beach (without considering what might live in them) or turn a salamander into a pet is common among naturally curious kids. But despite good intentions, a child’s curiosity can accidentally damage wildlife and their habitats.“I think the most important thing a parent can teach a child is respect for nature,” says physician Laura Kahn, co-founder of the One Health Initiative.And when taught the right way to interact with the wild, kids usually rise to the occasion, says Jaylyn Gough, a social worker and the founder of Native Women’s Wilderness. “It’s important for us to invest the time of telling our children: We’re not owners of the land. We’re here to take care of it.”So how do you keep your children from wreaking havoc in the wild while still enjoying the benefits of spending time outside, like increased confidence, focus, and empathy? Here are alternatives for some of the most common outdoor behavior no-nos.Kids might be tempted to pick a giant bouquet of flowers, pluck leaves off trees, or stash rocks, shells, or small critters inside backpacks. But remind them that these things are all part of the habitat and play an important role in its health.Animals depend on plants for food and hiding places, and rocks and shells for homes; plants depend on animals for things like fertilization and pollination. Gay says explaining to her son how plants and animals work together in nature helped him temper his temptations.“When you teach them that these are living things, that they grow, eat, and have a habitat, you’re teaching them about the ecology,” she says. “That leads them to be conservationists.”Instead, let kids explore with a magnifying glass instead of their curious fingers. Getting a close-up look at tiny parts of a habitat can help fuel their curiosity—and show children all the life that happens around what they once thought was insignificant.“We’re here to take care of our four-legged cousins and the creatures and the birds,” Gough says. “By remembering that the rocks and the flowers or whatever you find outside should stay outside, we’re helping to do our part.”It might seem like a fun idea to toss bread crumbs to local ducks or sprinkle seeds to feed chipmunks, but animals aren’t meant to be fed by humans. “Wild animals survive by relying on the food in their environments and ecosystems,” Kahn explains. “We do not want them to become dependent on human food.”Bears are a prime example of animals that often have to be killed after developing a taste for human food. “Animals have unique dietary needs that are different from humans,” Kahn says. “Eating human food can make them sick.”That’s why kids should take extra care to pack up any snacks they bring with them on hikes or trips to the park. Parents can encourage the principle by turning clean-up efforts after a picnic or afternoon snack into a game or competition. Break the family into teams to see who can collect the most trash.Kicking piles of leaves, trampling bushes, and trekking through forested areas instead of sticking to prescribed pathways can unintentionally wreak havoc on animal dwellings. And if surprised animals defend their homes, everyone could get hurt. “Trails are designed to cause the least amount of harm to delicate environments and ecosystems,” Kahn says.Instead, kids should be encouraged to understand the importance of paths. Cleaning up and maintaining trails through community initiatives is a start; art projects can help, too. For instance, collect leaves off the ground or bring a sketch pad to record what you see.The urge to get closer to or even touch a squirrel, bird, or slow-moving turtle can be strong for kids. But approaching an animal disrupts their behavior, which could affect eating, sleeping, or other things they need to do for survival. It can also be dangerous for children if the animal perceives them as a threat or exposes them to illness or injury.Instead, remind kids to stay away from any animal—even ones that seem harmless—and admire with their eyes. Bring along some binoculars for a closer view or show them how to use a camera’s zoom button.A dog’s inclination is to chase. And though it may be amusing to watch them track squirrels or rabbits, the introduction of a domestic animal can be harmful for the environment and the animals. Wild critters trying to escape from enthusiastic dogs might waste energy that’s crucial for things like feeding and raising young.And don’t forget about picking up poop!“Fecal waste introduces pathogens to the environment that could be picked up by wildlife,” Kahn cautions. And that can be detrimental for the ecosystem.The bottom line is for parents to remind children that outdoor spaces are someone or something’s home. “Nobody likes having a guest come in and destroy their home, leave trash, and act rudely,” Kahn says. “The same rules should apply with visiting wildlife in their homes.”",
"Not long ago, Quynh Tran, her husband, and their two daughters, 11 and 14, skated under a Castro Valley, California, highway overpass after dark. They watched their shadows grow up the sides of the concrete walls and pretended the shapes were monsters eating each other. “It's really neat having that experience when no one's around,” Tran says. “And it's a different feeling when you do it in the dark.”Playing in the dark can be a great way to take advantage of warm summer evenings or long winter nights while also mixing up routines—something many of us desperately need. Plus, having fun with the lights out can feel a little bit risky, and that’s a good thing for kids. Do it outside, and you might bolster your mental health, too.Over the last several decades, kids have become less independent, says Abigail Marsh, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgetown University and author of The Fear Factor. For example, a study found that in 1971, 55 percent of British kids under 10 were allowed to walk alone to places other than school, while that number shrunk to nearly zero by 2010—a percentage that Marsh confirms is likely similar today.And that's actually a problem. "Kids are built to seek out novel, challenging experiences because that's how they learn," she says. And without taking appropriate risks—like walking by themselves through a neighborhood or skating under a darkened overpass—many psychologists worry that kids won't be able to take on the bigger risks that come with adulthood. “You cannot learn how to do this from a book,” Marsh says.Parents can help kids build these skills. "Playing in the dark is such a good example of something that kids are afraid of," she says. "And parents' job is to scaffold those experiences for their children. Help them contextualize it, help them think about the risk, and make it fun. Teach children that they are able to do more than they think they can."For some kids, doing things that are mildly risky or scary can be especially helpful in a child's chaotic life, says Ashley Zucker, a child, adolescent, and general psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana, California. "Overcoming challenges can lead to an increased sense of independence, bravery, and problem-solving ability–which in a world of chaos can create a lot of safety and sense of accomplishment for children," she says.“For most kids, the dark is a scary place,” Zucker says. “It blocks out other distractions and stimuli in our environment.” So when the lights go out, imaginations can run wild.And when anxiety ratchets up, the brain adjusts how it manages stimulus. “The regions of our brain that control our visual and auditory senses become more active,” Zucker says. That means every gust of wind or creaky floorboard is louder; every shadow is more pronounced.And because the amygdala, which regulates the feeling of being scared, is highly developed at birth, it’s pretty easy to trigger young kids’ fear response. But as they move through early childhood into the tween years, the brain changes. “The connections between the amygdala and frontal cortex, which is involved in regulating emotion, are getting wired up during that time period,” Marsh says. That means they’re better able to manage their responses to scary things.So as the brain develops, playing in the dark can feel a lot less scary—and even ride that line between frightening and fun. “It’s very good at varying our responses to threat based on the proximity and seriousness of the threat,” Marsh says. “So when you're dealing with a threat that's unlikely to be really dangerous or sort of ambiguous, you'll get a smaller response from the amygdala.”But that response can still feel good, especially when we’re seeking out the feeling of fear, like during a game of hide-and-seek in the dark. “We’re scared before anything has even happened,” Zucker says. “The greater the buildup of suspense or anticipation, the greater the release when that fear has resolved.” After a welcome fright, cortisol and adrenaline spike, and endorphins and dopamine swirl through circuits in our bodies. All that creates pleasant feelings, Marsh says.Parents can test out different types of play in the dark to see which are a match for the age and fear-tolerance of their kids. "If kids have structure, they feel a little more safe," says Rebecca Young, a middle school teacher in Lafayette, California, and experienced flashlight tag facilitator.Setting physical boundaries is crucial, she says, like rules about how far kids can run or where they can hide. For older kids, Young says games tied to scary stories or urban legends can create age-appropriate fun. Some ideas:Flashlight tag: One person is "it" and uses the light of a flashlight to tag the other players “out.” Or you can modify so that all players have flashlights and the person who’s "it" must touch a player to get them out.Shadow puppets: Use a flashlight to make shapes with hands or cut-outs and project the shadows against the wall. Tell stories about the shapes—funny or creepy—depending on kids’ ages.Ghost in the graveyard: The “ghost” runs off to hide. When someone finds the ghost, she yells, "Ghost in the graveyard!" The ghost tries to tag the remaining players running back to base. Whomever is tagged becomes the ghost.Glow-in-the-dark games: Use glow-in-the-dark paint, pens, stickers, or glow-sticks to play simple games like hopscotch, hula hoops, limbo, scavenger hunt, or bowling in the dark.Tapping hide-and-seek: Hiding players tap two objects together every 60 seconds and the seeker uses the sounds to locate them. Hiders can change locations throughout the game.Disco in the dark: Turn out all the lights, play fun music, and dance! Add in a disco ball or glowsticks for more fun.Secret messages: Find a guide to Morse code then race to see who can decode a pre-created message first.Flashlight limbo: Ditch the stick and use a flashlight instead. Players must shimmy under the beam without breaking it.",
"LIFE SKILL: ConfidenceStep 1: Mark the trail.—Have kids choose where they want to explore in the dark. It could a familiar walk through the neighborhood, a stroll in a local park, or a nature trail near your house.—Challenge your kids to come up with several observation activities that fellow hikers will do on the trail. For instance:• If the hike is along a field, one activity might be to look for lightning bugs.• If the hike goes near water, another activity might be to listen for frogs and toads.• If the hike happens during a super-clear night, one more activity might be to search for the Big Dipper.• If the hike passes wild plants or neighborhood gardens, sniff out fragrant flowers that bloom at night.—A couple hours before the hike, have kids place lit glow sticks along the trail where they’ll stop to do each activity.Step 2: Let your kid lead.—Remember, your child is in charge the hike. It’s OK for an adult to get the hikers to the “trailhead,” but once you arrive, turn things over to your kid.—Before starting, have your child provide hikers these tips:• Let your eyes adjust to the darkness.• Use flashlights sparingly and follow the moonlight as much as possible.• Walk slowly.• Keep voices down while walking to avoid startling the animals.• Stay silent at the observation stops.—Allow your child to lead hikers from glow stick to glow stick and give instructions at each stop. (Make sure to collect each one as you pass.)—Ensure your little leader pauses long enough at each observation stop to complete the activity. (Three minutes is a good amount of time for distraction-prone kids.) It’s up to the child to decide when to move on to the next activity.Download free Nat Geo maps.",
"Tired of the "I'm bored" announcements that never seem to end? Here’s an idea: Look up.Stargazing is an accessible activity for families—and a great excuse to introduce kids to astronomy. (Explore National Geographic Kids’ space hub.) For starters, parents can teach their children about the basics of the cosmos, such as major constellations, planets, and the moon.Now is actually a great time to explore the night sky. With many businesses still shuttered and vehicles still off the roads, stars are even brighter and easier to spot due to the lack of light pollution interfering with the view of the night sky. Here are some ideas to get your family started.Skywatching toolsAll you really need is a view of the night sky and your eyes. But binoculars and inexpensive telescopes can enhance the experience.A pair of 7x50 binoculars, the most popular size, is ideal for skywatching. When it comes to family telescopes, the two main types are lens-based refractors and reflectors that focus starlight using mirrors. The main features to look for in a scope are a high-quality lens, a rock-solid mount, and a set of three eyepieces that you can use to change magnification. (See beautiful stargazing photos taken by Nat Geo readers.)Screen time can actually be your friend when it comes to viewing the night sky. For instance, SpaceWeather.com publishes up-to-date forecasts for when the sun’s auroras—colorful light shows—are flaring up in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. Heavens-above.com describes when to spot the International Space Station and other bright satellites orbiting above your home. And Skymaps.com offers free printable downloads of monthly charts that show where all the brightest stars can be seen in local skies.Smartphones can also be a resource for roaming the night sky. Download a free planetarium app like Star Chart, which allows you to hold your phone up to the night sky and plot out countless stars and planet positions.Start with the moonWherever you live, the moon is a good starting point. Our nearest cosmic neighbor is the easiest object to see without binoculars or a telescope.Ask kids to make out the brighter, light-colored patches on its disk—those areas are covered with 20,000-foot mountain ranges and highlands filled with round craters of all sizes—some bigger than New York City.The best time to explore the moon’s surface with a telescope or binoculars is when its disk is half lit (called the quarter moon), or when it’s a crescent. Pay particular attention to the boundary line between the sunlit side and the dark part of the disk. It’s along this region that you’ll see jaw-dropping views of long shadows cast by jagged mountain ranges and uplifted crater rims. Encourage children to imagine what it was like for Apollo 13 astronauts as they looked out their spacecraft at the moon below, as they orbited it more than 50 years ago.One idea for an astronomy-themed project: Have kids take photos of the moon as it cycles through its monthly phases. To make the photos more dramatic, frame them with foreground objects like your house or a tree, or maybe yourself—a lunar selfie. At the end of the month, create a collage using a free phone app like Instagram’s Layout. (Get kid-friendly instructions to draw the moon.)Visit faraway worldsWith the unaided eye, up to five planets—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—can be easily seen on evenings and early mornings throughout the year from anywhere on the planet.In April and May, viewers across the world can look toward the western sky at dusk see a startlingly vivid Venus, the brightest object in the sky. Meanwhile if you look toward the east an hour before your local sunrise, you’ll see the planetary trio of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.Even though all three planets are many millions of miles away and basically look like vibrant stars, you can still tell the difference between them. Jupiter, the brightest, is creamy-white; Saturn is golden-yellow; and Mars is a faint orange-red because of the rust-filled dust covering its surface.As a fun experiment, have kids hold their binoculars steady while watching Jupiter; they’ll observe its four largest moons, first seen by Italian astronomer Galileo over 400 years ago using the newly invented telescope.Then on a piece of paper, ask them to draw the positions of each moon beside Jupiter. The next night or two, check them out again and see how the moons have shifted positions. (Virtually explore some of the world’s best stargazing spots.)Go star-hoppingOne of the most famous star patterns in the Northern Hemisphere is the Big Dipper, located in the constellation Ursa Major, which translates to “big bear” in Latin.The next clear night this spring, look high overhead in the northern sky and spot the dipper’s “bowl” appearing to pour its contents onto Earth. Use the stars that mark the outer edge of the bowl to draw an imaginary line toward the horizon until you hit the next brightest star. That’s Polaris (aka the North Star), part of the Ursa Minor (“little bear”) constellation.For those in the Southern Hemisphere, the distinctive and highly visible Southern Cross is a great jumping-off point to star hop around the night sky. First have kids identify the spine of the cross with their binoculars and draw an imaginary line below it. That leads to a spot between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two of the largest and brightest dwarf galaxies that orbit our Milky Way.Next, tell them to look at the cross’s arms, and move to the right until they reach a bright cloud-like object. This is the Eta Carinae nebula, a giant cloud of gas and dust that lies 10,000 light-years from Earth.And don’t forget our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Over the next few months, the ghostly glow of the Milky Way’s band of stars will become more noticeable. Use binoculars to tour the millions of stars arching across the overhead sky.With nothing more than your eyes and a good star chart, together your family can embark on your own journey across the universe—even though you’re likely staying at home.",

"A magical variety of shapes and colors dance in the sky as solar wind buffets Earth's magnetic field. When the aurora peaked in the late 1980s, shows over Churchill, Manitoba, included a green ribbon and a rosy curtain.The whole dome of night sky was awash with color: cascades of yellow-green and blushes of crimson fanning from a darker point high overhead. As they fell in broad rays, they shifted and changed in brightness, sometimes intense in one place, then cool, then hot. It was like looking up into the heart of a flower of glorious light whose petals rippled in a breeze that could not be felt—a breath from beyond this planet.That aurora (Latin for "dawn") lit up the night at my home in the Scottish Highlands more than a decade ago, but to this day I can picture its colors, shapes, and movements. The show peaked for less than an hour, but its tonal themes lingered longer. It seemed an act of magic, but I knew that science had unveiled this magic act: Electrically charged particles from the sun were making gases glow in the upper atmosphere.Thousands of miles away, in Alaska, the aurora also caught the attention of Charles Deehr, a physicist at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. "That display on March 13-14, 1989, was one of the best in the last 50 years," he said.I visited Deehr in March 2001 during the current phase of intense auroral activity. Deehr is a wiry man who retains, in his sixties, a youthful zest for new research ventures. His work in auroral forecasting mixes science and divination as he searches for patterns in the latest information sent from near-Earth satellites in hopes of predicting auroral activity a day or so in advance. Such forewarning makes it possible to prepare electrical systems on Earth and in space for disturbances.Scientists use satellites to gauge an aurora's power, but it was the 1989 aurora's extreme reach that demonstrated to most of us how unusual it was. Most auroras are visible only in the higher latitudes (above 60 degrees), but that one showed up as far south as Key West in Florida and the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. People unnerved by the fiery tint in the sky phoned the police; others watched in awe. Within 90 seconds of the aurora's reaching the skies above Quebec, magnetic storms associated with it caused a province-wide collapse of the power grid, leaving six million Canadians without electricity for hours. At the same time, compass readings became unreliable, and there were reports of automatic garage doors opening and closing on their own. Radio transmissions and coastal navigation systems were disrupted, and information feeds from some satellites were temporarily lost.These troubles were a clear illustration of the need to predict auroras. In the Middle Ages a glowing red aurora over middle latitudes was seen by some Europeans as an omen of bloody battle or other impending doom. The superstition may have faded, but in a time of increasing reliance on high-tech links, discovering what auroras might actually signify has taken on practical relevance and a new urgency.Charles Deehr arrived in Fairbanks with several other graduate students in physics in 1958. They were participating in the International Geophysical Year (IGY), which brought together scientists from 67 countries to study Earth's surface, interior, and atmosphere. The great red aurora of February 1958—perhaps the most extraordinary of the century—had just occurred. This indicated explosive activity on the sun, ideal conditions for auroral research. "The preceding year had the most sunspot activity ever recorded, and we had fancy big auroras every night," Deehr said.Since the mid-1800s it has been known that the number of sunspots—dark, cooler patches of intense magnetic activity that are often accompanied by major eruptions on the solar disc—peaks roughly every 11 years. Sunspot numbers are usually high for a couple of years or so before and after the crest of this wave, known as the solar maximum. Auroras are hooked in to that roller coaster. So when the sun is restless, as it was in the late 1950s, Earth's night skies may dance.Deehr's group contributed to the discovery that there are two great ovals of auroral activity encircling the geomagnetic poles—one for the aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, one for the mirroring aurora australis in the Southern. These typically bulge farther toward the Equator on Earth's night side and change shape a bit in the course of a single day. During a big aurora they may move even farther, giving people beyond the normal limits a glimpse of the lights.The aurora of 1958 also coincided with the dawn of the space age. Our understanding of auroras comes in huge measure from linking insights gained through manned space missions to data and images from satellites, rockets, and observatories on the ground. The current research armory includes various craft in the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program. Largely under the command of NASA, the European Space Agency, and Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, this international endeavor uses spacecraft to study the sun—including sunspot activity—and its effects on the Earth. The ISTP missions have roughly coincided with the present solar cycle, which reached solar maximum in 2000 and is likely to produce atmospheric fireworks for the next couple of years.During my time with Charles Deehr, there had been a lull in auroral activity. "Things are picking up again," he said, pointing to a diagram on his laptop. Red lines spiraled from a central point like water jets from a garden sprinkler. "The sprinkler is the sun," Deehr explained. "There are sources on the sun that give off charged particles—electrons and positive ions-—at different speeds. This spray of superhot ionized gas, known as plasma, blows across interplanetary space in what is termed the solar wind.There is always auroral activity somewhere over the Earth. But its strength and extent vary hugely, according to what the sun has been hurling at us in preceding days. Flares that release energy bursts as powerful as millions of volcanic eruptions and coronal mass ejections that send hurricane blasts of ten billion tons of plasma into space figure more often during active parts of the solar cycle.The sun, like the Earth and most of the planets, is a huge magnet, with its own force field stretching far beyond it. This gets twisted into a spiral by the sun's rotation, and within it the solar wind particles course along magnetic field lines that channel their movements. The eye-catching computer graphics Deehr showed me were an attempt to model the path of that energy from the sun to beyond the Earth.As they zoom toward near-Earth space, the particle streams hit the edge of our planet's own magnetic sheath—the magnetosphere. Deflected by the magnetosphere, like water meeting a rock, the solar wind swirls past Earth and then pushes in again on the night side, squeezing the magnetosphere and elongating it into a comet-shaped tail. On the day side, the magnetosphere grows when the solar breeze is light and shrinks in a solar gale.Charged particles that get trapped in the "magnetotail," which may stretch millions of miles, can be sent hurtling back toward Earth. Then, in a variety of possible ways not yet fully understood, some eventually rain down into the upper atmosphere over the polar regions—the places where our protective magnetic envelope is most open to space.Auroral light comes largely from electrons hitting oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere, the same phenomenon that produces the glow in a neon lighting tube. But in the aurora the illumination can be 600 miles (965.6 kilometers) high, stretch for thousands of miles, and be linked to a magnetospheric power generator churning out three million megawatts or more—about four times the electricity the United States uses at peak summer demand.I asked Deehr what my chances were for an aurora that night, my last in Fairbanks. He clicked a couple of keys. "Here's where we're seeing a piling up of fast and slow particles. When we plot out what we think is going to happen, our model says we could get some increase in auroral activity later today."But my departure was not to be graced by an aurora. I was reminded of what he had said about forecasting them. "There are no guarantees. We're still about a hundred years behind the meteorologists—it's that bad, or good."In the past few years the term space weather has become a catchall to include eruptions from the sun, variations in the solar wind, and changes in the magnetosphere, which can in turn affect the Earth's atmosphere, producing auroras. Part of the uncertainty in making space-weather predictions is the difficulty of relating an event in one part of this vast system—such as in the sun—to a later event on Earth, such as an auroral display. "A lot can happen in 93 million miles (149.7 million kilometers);" was how one space physicist put it. Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, are part of an international team at the forefront of research into auroras and connections between the sun and the Earth."One of the most important aspects of auroras is that the polar regions are where the magnetic field lines concentrate," said Mario Acuna as we stood on a walkway overlooking a huge space-hardware testing floor. Acuna, who was born in Argentina and still speaks in a warm, accented baritone, is a veteran of NASA science missions from the early satellite days. "So over a small region you can observe what is happening over a gigantic volume in space. The complexity lies in how we can relate this auroral picture to phenomena that are happening elsewhere in the magnetosphere."To make sense of the system, he explained, we need, as in weather forecasting, to have enough instruments in key places to understand cause and effect—where the energy comes from, how it gets transformed, and where it ends up. "That's the strategy behind the multiplicity of craft flying today," he said. "They are operating in four key regions. There have been some major changes in thinking because of the results."One accomplishment was when the ISTP's Polar spacecraft (under NASA control and working on the sunward side of Earth) and Japan's Geotail craft (working in the magnetotail on the night side) made the very first direct observations of a crucial hookup between the magnetic fields of the sun and the Earth. Called reconnection, this linkage is an important aspect of the transformation that allows the solar wind's energy to penetrate Earth's magnetic cocoon, leading to auroras.Another recent breakthrough from Polar is the finding that waves of energy flowing along magnetic field lines at more than 6,000 miles (9,656 kilometers) a second become more intense as the lines converge near Earth. These Alfvén waves (named for Hannes Alfvén, the Swedish physicist and Nobel laureate who first proposed their existence) appear to be what power an auroral display, by accelerating particles down from space. That's the big picture. But what shapes the finer detail of the classic auroral patterns—the curtains, folds, and rays—still awaits explanation.Head reeling with ideas from space physics, I needed to reconnect with the visible aurora and the feelings it can stir. Yellowknife is the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories and the top global destination for aurora tourism. Last year some 12,000 people came here to see auroras—a pursuit of the truly dedicated in this frost-bitten location.Raven Tours, the oldest of the aurora enterprises, was founded by Bill Tait in 1981. Tait was away in Japan drumming up business, but Jared Minty, an eager young co-director, gave me the essential information. "In our current aurora tour season, which runs from mid-November through mid-April, we'll have more than 9,000 clients," he said happily. "The other main operators will also have a few thousand. Almost all these clients are Japanese."I observed the Japanese enthusiasm for auroras that night at Prelude Lake, some miles from town. With each burst of celestial choreography, groups of people cheered and clapped, some of the women ululating in high-pitched tones. Japanese passion for auroras intensified during the 1990s. Ask the average Yellowknife resident, as I did over a beer in the Raven Bar, and many will say that the Japanese believe that conceiving a child under a good aurora increases the chances of having a gifted offspring. This urban myth may have started in April 1992 with an episode of Northern Exposure, a TV series set in small-town Alaska and filmed in Washington State. In it an aurora begins while a group of Japanese visitors are in a guesthouse, and they all run upstairs to try their luck under the northern lights."How can they say that about us?" asked Yukiko Suzuki. Yukiko, who is from Tokuyama in western Japan, had found aurora work in Yellowknife for the winter. "In Japan we cannot watch the northern lights, but we know how it's beautiful and great," she said. "That's why they're coming.”Don Morin, part Chipewyan, part Cree, and a former Northwest Territories premier, gave me another perspective on the aurora. "Many of the original peoples of North America have medicine animals," he told me one night as we sat in a huge tepee at Aurora Village, established by his family to give tourists a flavor of tribal life in addition to aurora-viewing opportunities."So when you pass on, you're going to go into an animal spirit. That's the next stop." For Morin's people, spirit life after death is a two-stage process. "When you pass on again, you end up in the dancing spirit—that's the aurora spirit. When we were kids, we were told that you have to be quiet when the aurora comes out. You don't want to upset the spirits in the sky by calling them closer.""They've always been sacred to us," said Suzan Marie, a Déné-Chipewyan and Cree woman from the South Slave region. "But of course with elders telling us as children not to whistle at the lights, we had to test to see if it was really true. We knew we shouldn't be doing it, and if they really started to move, we'd get frightened and not stay out too long."Which, as in many tales, was the down-to-earth practicality that complements the elders' spiritual spin on the world.In Norway I met a man at Tromsø's Auroral Observatory who bridges the contrasting responses to auroras. Asgeir Brekke is a physicist who has studied the northern lights for more than three decades, but he is also an expert on auroral lore and legend. The walls of his office are hung with an intriguing mix of images, from radar stations to figures from northern mythology. Brekke is a soft-spoken man with a sweep of graying hair, and as we talked, he probed the images of death and life that recur in stories of aurora in different cultures—the links to spirits and battles between supernatural forces in the sky."I think for many people the phenomenon was scary, but some brave souls had their own thoughts about it." He mentioned the Norwegian who in about 1250 proposed rational-sounding explanations for the northern lights. One was that Greenland's ice drew in so much power that it could light the beams of the aurora. Along similar lines, he said, other Scandinavians had wondered if the lights were reflections from the sea or even from the glinting scales of huge shoals of herring.Brekke circled back to science. "The current satellite experiments and those fascinating pictures that show the auroral ring around the Pole are fantastic achievements," he said. "I feel that the northern lights give a linkage between science and art. Even though as a scientist you are supposed to have some sort of objectivity, like an artist, you are inspired by them."In collaboration with Dagfinn Bakke, an artist in Lofoten, Brekke has produced a book of watercolor paintings, scientific accounts, folktales, and poetry to show how people in Norway have related to auroras over the centuries. As I'd now come to understand, Brekke's enthusiasm for the lights represents a common bond between people who live beneath them and those who study them from afar. When he ended our meeting by reading poems about auroras, it seemed only fitting.Poetry and space physics? Of course there's a connection. Just look up when the heavens dance.",
"Yuri Gagarin, Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Neil Armstrong—the first wave of space travelers—were military-trained astronauts thought to have the “right stuff” for risky missions.But early spaceflight wasn’t the exclusive province of men—or even humans. Fruit flies, monkeys, mice, dogs, rabbits, and rats flew into space before humans.More than three years before Gagarin became the first human in space with his April 1961 journey around Earth, the Soviets famously—or perhaps infamously—sent up a stray dog. Laika was the first animal to orbit Earth but died during her flight. The United States launched a chimpanzee named Ham into space. Happily, he survived, clearing the way for Shepard to became the first American in space in May 1961.Despite discrimination, women were also pioneers. Some, such as mathematician Katherine Johnson—who hand-calculated the details of the trajectory of the flight that would make Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962—stayed behind the scenes. Valentina Tereshkova, an early cosmonaut, became the first woman in orbit in 1963. It wasn’t until two decades later that Sally Ride flew on the space shuttle Challenger to become the first American woman to reach space.A bespectacled, bearded Russian recluse fond of science fiction, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky believed humanity’s destiny lay among the stars. By the early 1900s, he had worked out the equation for humans to slip beyond Earth’s gravitational pull. He also imagined how moon-bound rockets would work: using a mix of liquid propellants and igniting multiple stages.Independently, Hermann Oberth and Robert Goddard reached similar conclusions. By 1926, Goddard, an American, had built and launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. About that time, Oberth, who lived in Germany, determined multiple stages are crucial for long journeys.Four decades later, the trio’s ideas roared to life in the enormous Saturn V rockets that thrust Apollo crews into space. Measuring 363 feet tall and fueled by liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and kerosene, the Saturn V was the most powerful rocket ever built. Engineered by Wernher von Braun—a Nazi Germany rocket scientist who relocated much of his team to work for the U.S. after World War II—the Saturn V had three stages that fired in sequence. Rocketry is still governed by Tsiolkovsky’s equation. But no rocket has yet eclipsed the Saturn V, which propelled humans closer to the stars than ever before.Five bell-shaped engines powered the initial stage of the Saturn V rocket, which shot most of the Apollo missions beyond Earth’s orbit and eventually carried astronauts to the moon. Together the five engines generated as much energy as 85 Hoover dams.In the 1960s our moon was still very much a mystery. To learn the most from the Apollo visits, NASA selected landing sites in a variety of lunar terrains, including the dark, flat plains sculpted by vanished lava oceans and highlands formed by meteor impacts.From 1969 to 1972, U.S. astronauts landed at six sites, each chosen for different scientific objectives. All of them were on the moon’s mottled near side, where the terrain had been studied extensively by lunar orbiters and Mission Control could remain in direct contact with the astronauts.Space agencies have sent probes, with no people on them and thus no need to worry about human safety, to visit far-flung places in the solar system. Spacecraft have explored 60 other moons and even set down on one, Saturn’s Titan. On our own moon, robotic rovers have left tracks at four sites.China made history earlier this year by setting its Chang’e 4 lander on the moon’s far side.The first private lander to reach the moon crashed in April, but the Israeli nonprofit behind it quickly announced plans to try again.Not to be outdone, the U.S. intends to send a series of landers with technology to lay the groundwork for astronauts to return.Over four years, NASA astronauts hauled 842 pounds of moon rocks back to Earth. But the most profound souvenirs weigh nothing: images of Earth. Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders snapped an iconic one on Christmas Eve in 1968, showing our blue planet suspended in darkness near the moon’s sterile, cratered horizon.Astronauts didn’t just take photos and collect moon rocks, they also carried an array of objects from Earth into space with them.One of NASA’s most requested space photos, this view of Earth, known as Blue Marble, was taken in 1972 from about 18,000 miles away, as Apollo 17 was traveling to the moon.John Young (Gemini 3) notoriously smuggled aboard a corned beef sandwich and shared it with Gus Grissom, his crewmate. Grissom pocketed it when crumbs began to float around the cabin.Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11) took wine, bread, and a chalice to celebrate Communion. His crewmate Neil Armstrong carried a piece of the Wright Flyer’s wooden propeller. Alan Shepard (Apollo 14) used a sock to hide a six-iron clubhead, which he attached to a tool handle to hit two golf balls on the moon. Charles Duke (Apollo 16) packed a family photo and left it in the Descartes highlands.After landing on the moon, Buzz Aldrin drank consecrated wine from this three-inch goblet, which is still used by his former church near Houston.Perhaps the most poignant memento on the lunar surface is a small aluminum human figure, placed there by David Scott during Apollo 15. It rests near a placard bearing the names of 14 fallen astronauts and cosmonauts.As the space race boomed, it catapulted its aspirations into the zeitgeist—and transformed the way we live.Sputnik inspired replicas and songs. Life magazine published exclusive stories on the lives of the celebrated Mercury Seven, the United States’ first astronauts. Seattle built the Space Needle for the World’s Fair. Stanley Kubrick created 2001: A Space Odyssey. The space age flourished in movies, TV, music, architecture, and design, where the sleek, aerodynamic lines of rockets inspired the look of cars and trains.Space is still lodged in popular culture. The NASA logo appears everywhere, from tattoos to Vans high-tops. We’ve had Star Trek, The Jetsons, Mork & Mindy, Star Wars, and the current spate of Mars movies and space-themed TV shows. Also: the Houston Astros and the Houston Rockets, Space Camp, antigravity ballpoint pens, astronaut ice cream, the moonwalk, and Space Mountain.Billed as “the first space age–inspired car,” the Firebird III, built by General Motors, was powered by a gas turbine engine and sported seven fins. The 1958 concept car had a computer, electronic controls, and a joystick to accelerate, brake, and steer.The January 10, 1967, issue of Look magazine featured this Norman Rockwell painting of how it might look when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. Rockwell, a stickler for accuracy, consulted experts and collaborated with a space artist to create this vision.Concepts like “the right stuff,” “moon shot,” and “light-years” figure into everyday conversation. Your first day back after vacation might be filled with “reentry” problems. Your craft-brewed IPA might taste like “rocket fuel” or even use those words as its name. And, on discovering a distressing situation, you might calmly say, “Houston, we have a problem.”When human beings stepped on the moon 50 years ago, it was one of history’s most astounding moments, and not just because our first visit to another world was among humanity’s greatest scientific achievements or because it was the culmination of an epic race between two global superpowers, though both were true. The New York Times put a poem by Archibald MacLeish on the front page, and newscaster Walter Cronkite, “the most trusted man in America,” would come to say that people living 500 years in the future would regard the lunar landing as “the most important feat of all time.”The ultimate significance, however, was not that the race had ended or even that a once unimaginable milestone had been attained.This achievement was really just the beginning.The beginning of a new era in humanity’s vision of its horizons, of the places we could explore and might even inhabit. Having started as a landfaring species, expanded our reach to the entire planet when we became seafaring, and conquered the atmosphere above Earth when powered flight made us skyfarers, we were now destined to be pilgrims in a vast new realm. We were spacefarers—and soon, as this seminal triumph helped us get over what celebrated scientist and writer Isaac Asimov called our “planetary chauvinism,” we would become an extraplanetary species. “Earthlings” would no longer be sufficient to describe who we were.All this is what was widely expected, amid the euphoria and wonder on July 20, 1969, when Eagle, Apollo 11’s lunar module, touched down on the moon’s surface. The greatest journey starts with a single step. A small step for one man; a giant leap for all of humankind.The head of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Thomas O. Paine, was soon aiming for Mars, and not just as a someday goal but with a detailed itinerary laid out in National Geographic. Depart: October 3, 1983. Crew of 12, split between two 250-foot-long spacecraft fired by nuclear rockets. Enter Mars orbit: June 9, 1984. Eighty days of exploration on the Martian surface. Return to Earth orbit: May 25, 1985.The very act of reaching the moon somehow exalted the human race, yielding confidence that we would indeed push deeper into space. “Wherever we went, people, instead of saying, ‘Well, you Americans did it,’ everywhere they said, ‘We did it!’ ” recalled Michael Collins, the pilot of Apollo 11’s command module. “We humankind, we the human race, we people did it.”Sunrise is still a few hours away, and as the bus cuts a lonely path through miles of remote steppe in southern Kazakhstan, its headlights occasionally illuminate for the briefest of moments a giant faded mural or a chipped tile mosaic. These stylized works of art show the ravages of baking summers and bitter winters. They adorn huge, rusting, abandoned buildings, and they celebrate the decades-old glories of a space program in a nation that no longer exists: the Soviet Union.Finally, after miles of this Twilight Zone landscape of Cold War detritus, the bus makes a sudden turn down a gated lane and arrives at a giant, banged-up structure that is definitely not abandoned. Well-armed Russian and Kazakh security officers in camouflage gear seem to have the place surrounded, and it’s bathed in floodlights. Inside this hangar is a gleaming new rocket ship.I’ve come to the Baikonur Cosmodrome because, just shy of the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, it’s the only place on the planet where I can watch a human blast off to space. In turn, the only place in the universe these people can fly to is the International Space Station, some 250 miles above Earth, which is barely one-thousandth of the distance to the moon.For the past eight years, ever since NASA retired the space shuttle, the only way it has been able to get an American astronaut to the space station has been to hitch a ride with its Russian counterpart, known as Roscosmos, at roughly $82 million for a seat up and back down.Fifty years on from the moon landing, this is where we are in space, if by “we,” we mean human beings. Which sure sounds like basically nowhere, at least as measured by the yardstick of 1969’s great expectations. Twelve people—all Americans, all men—have stepped on the moon, none since 1972, and other than on Earth-orbiting space stations, no human has set foot anywhere else in the universe.Measured another way, of course, we’re doing extraordinary things in space.We’ve sent uncrewed probes to explore all the other planets in our solar system, yielding astonishing photographs and troves of data. The twin Voyager spacecraft have literally sped across the solar system and into interstellar space, the first human-made objects ever to do so. They’re more than 11 billion miles away and still communicating with us.Because the Voyagers could travel forever into the void and both the sun and the Earth have an expiration date (don’t worry, it’s a ways off), it’s conceivable that one day these sedan-size eternal sojourners will be the only evidence that we ever existed. Yet it’s also conceivable that a successor species to us will have long gone interstellar by then, hopefully granting us some recognition for their feat.And if they do, they may well point to this moment in time—the late 2010s, the early 2020s—as the “inflection shift,” which is how Jim Keravala, a physicist who has overseen satellite launches on Russian, European, and U.S. rockets, characterizes the frenzy of activity in the commercial space industry today.We are, Keravala says, at the dawn of “the true beginning of the era of space settlement and humanity’s future off-world.” (Keravala now heads OffWorld, a company that intends to deploy millions of robots to turn the inner solar system into a “better, gentler, greener place for life and civilization.”)Keravala’s intriguing prediction is highly debatable, in part because that old industry chestnut—“space is hard”—happens to be true; setbacks and delays are virtually always part of the march to progress.But it’s undeniable that something big is going on in space. Two U.S. companies, SpaceX and Boeing, are moving closer to certification of their spaceship models, putting NASA “on the precipice of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,” in the words of NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. These ships—which are to Apollo’s cramped modules as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is to a prop-driven airliner of the 1950s—may carry out crewed missions by late this year or early next year.Meanwhile, spacecraft built for two other private companies, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, have also made major strides, bringing us ever closer to a novel era of space tourism. To begin, they will shoot well-heeled customers up to an elevation of 60-odd miles, to the edge of outer space, where the clientele will experience zero-gravity weightlessness and see the black void of the universe and the blue curvature of the Earth. All this can be yours for a mere $200,000 or so at present—though both companies say prices will drop rapidly and options expand as they bring more rocket ships on line.Blue Origin is also shaking up the race to put humans back on the moon, announcing in May that it’s building a lander named Blue Moon. The robotic vehicle will be able to haul up to seven tons of cargo and could put astronauts on the lunar surface by 2024.The action in space is hardly confined to American companies or Russia’s program. In January, China boasted that it “opened a new chapter” in lunar exploration by soft-landing an uncrewed spaceship on the far side of the moon, the first time a vehicle had ever touched down there. That spacecraft deployed a rover and carried a “mini-biosphere,” designed to test whether fruit flies and a variety of plants and seeds can work together to create a self-contained food chain in lunar conditions. China announced in April that it intends to build a research station on the moon’s south polar region within the next decade, although the nation’s space agency remains mum about how soon it might try to land “taikonauts,” as its astronauts are known, on the lunar surface.In Israel, which sees itself as a plucky “start-up nation,” there were both cheers and tears in April, when a nonprofit consortium calledSpaceIL made history as the first private concern to orbit the moon. But its bid to make Israel the fourth country to soft-land an object there had a hard ending: SpaceIL’s small spacecraft called Beresheet (Hebrew for Genesis, or “in the beginning”) instead crashed on the lunar surface and lost contact with mission control.In remote New Zealand, from a launchpad adjacent to a giant sheep pasture, a company called Rocket Lab is sending innovative, low-cost rockets bearing satellites into low Earth orbit.At the edge of Dubai, where Emirates airline has forged a massive global crossroads for air travelers out of once empty desert, an entirely new and even more colossal airport under construction is being billed as the world’s first “cosmotropolis.” Authorities say it will be capable of handling rocket ships and hyper- and supersonic aircraft as well as conventional jet airliners.And in Japan, JAXA, the official space agency, announced in March that it was working with Toyota to develop a crewed moon rover that would enable astronauts to travel 6,000 miles on the lunar surface.Much of today’s rocketry is fueled by an intense competition among a few superbillionaires whose ambitions (and egos) appear to be out of this world.Their spacecraft are different from yesteryear’s because they are not being developed purely for scientific exploration. These spacecraft are intended to make money by fulfilling the expensive wishes of wannabe astronauts or harvesting valuable resources through mining on asteroids; by flying people quickly between any two points on Earth; and indeed, as Keravala suggests, by ultimately making us a multi-planetary species.Many of these space titans have a clear vision of where they’re taking the rest of us, but collectively we have barely begun to discuss the ethics—or wisdom—of it all. If, as the relentless evangelist for space and commerce Jeff Bezos has insisted, the solar system can easily support “a trillion humans,” among whom we would have “a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts,” should we then heed the Amazon founder’s call to go forth and multiply in the firmament? (And if so, will Amazon Prime deliver?)At the same time, there is something very curious about the lofty slogans, visions, and mission statements that private space companies feature in their promotional materials: Many contend that going to space is actually about … saving the Earth—and making it a better place.“We open space to change the world for good” (Virgin Galactic, founded by billionaire Richard Branson). “To preserve Earth … we must go to space to tap its unlimited resources and energy” (Blue Origin, Bezos’s company). “We open access to space to improve life on Earth” (Rocket Lab). “Imagine most journeys taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less” (SpaceX, brainchild of billionaire Elon Musk, who says space travel will make such Earth-to-Earth trips feasible).Why are we in space? Fifty years ago, it was easy to answer the question. To reach the moon! Sure, discovery, generally; and national prestige, specifically. To issue a grand proclamation of goodwill: “We came in peace for all mankind.” Everybody knew the point was to step on the moon, return safely, and crow about it.Ask that question today, however, and you may get any of a dozen answers. These are worth examining, because you can’t explore whether we should be in space without a sense of what we are doing there—or aiming to do.Outside the hangar in Kazakhstan, I step off the bus along with the rest of my group—a large crop of reporters, mostly Russians and a few Canadians. We stand around and stomp our feet for a while, as it’s cold on this early December day—seven degrees Fahrenheit with a rattling wind that has a well-below-zero feel to it.We are at the edge of a security barrier—my group on this side, wielding cameras and notebooks, the security guys on the other side, gripping guns and speaking purposefully into walkie-talkies tucked into the shoulders of their uniforms. The rocket ship is on its side on a flatbed railcar, four conical boosters at the base of a white cylinder, with a brightly painted Russian flag at the top. As it sounds a low whistle, the train slowly pulls out, headed to the launchpad a few miles away.There’s some drama to the launch because the previous one, in October, was aborted just 57 miles up when a sensor malfunction prompted the crew capsule to separate from the rocket and booster assembly. NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin averted disaster with a harrowing emergency landing.“The crew was lucky,” Anne McClain, an Army lieutenant colonel, Iraq war veteran, and helicopter pilot, explained in a NASA-TV news conference. “But every crew that makes it to orbit is lucky. Spaceflight’s not easy.”McClain should know: A NASA astronaut, she’s on the launch I’m at the Cosmodrome to see.Now Roscosmos says the problem is fixed and this Soyuz rocket launch will be trouble free. And indeed, from behind a glass wall in a special quarantine zone, McClain and the other two crew members are telling us—in English, in Russian, and in French—that they share that faith. Thumbs-up all around. A Russian Orthodox priest, as is customary these days, blesses the crew and the ship with holy water in two brief but solemn ceremonies; he even blesses the assembled reporters, a touch I cannot help but appreciate in this era of relentless attacks on the free press.At Baikonur, reporters witness a launch from a distance of just under a mile, which is significantly closer than at Cape Canaveral, where they are kept about three miles away. It’s a mesmerizing and profound spectacle: the huge burst of orange flame at the rocket’s base on ignition, the engine roar, the rumbling, shaking ground. The awe I feel is intensified by the knowledge that at the very tip of the ship, three of my fellow human beings are trusting that all will be well as they are shot straight up into the sky.The number of human beings living in space is about to double—from three to six. In less than three weeks the three already at the space station would come home, and the human census beyond Earth’s atmosphere—on the moon, on all the other planets in the solar system, on all those other moons, on asteroids, and in or on the many things that humankind has built and launched into orbit over six decades—would drop back down to three. The other 7.6 billion or so of us? We’re still earthbound.Soon, however, the United States could have not one but two American-made options for getting astronauts to space, finally severing NASA’s sole dependence on Russian Soyuz rockets. These new spaceships are a first step toward much longer range missions: to the moon, to asteroids, and even to Mars.And so, a few months after the surprisingly moving, even mystical experience of watching the Soyuz liftoff, I find myself some 170 feet above the ground on a gorgeous blue-sky Florida day, the Atlantic Ocean sparkling a half mile away.I’m at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, atop Space Launch Complex 41, whose history dates to 1965, when it began launching Titan rockets for the space programs that preceded Apollo. It’s eventually going to launch Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule, which will carry as many as five passengers at a time to the International Space Station.The first thing I notice after stepping off the elevator are four parallel zip lines leading to the ground at the very edge of the launch complex.“If you’re an astronaut, you really, really don’t want to be taking that ride,” says Tony Taliancich, director and general manager of launch operations for ULA, a launch alliance that is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Taliancich, imposingly built but perpetually smiling during my tour of his bailiwick, explains that these 1,300-foot-long zip lines are a critical part of the escape system, in case a last-minute explosion, fire, or other emergency provokes an abandon-ship order.They bring to mind the fire that erupted in the cabin of the Apollo 1 spacecraft in January 1967, a tragedy that quickly claimed the lives of three astronauts at Launch Complex 34 near here, now a memorial site honoring the men “who made the ultimate sacrifice so others could reach the stars.”They’re also a useful reminder: Despite the strides NASA has made in its perpetual quest to make spaceflight safer, it’s still a dangerous business. Our astronauts are essentially stepping on top of a bomb whenever they climb into the capsule of a spacecraft, a bomb they trust will go off in a controlled manner.Of the 135 space shuttle flights, two ended in disaster, claiming seven lives each. If we accepted that failure rate in the commercial airliners we rely on in this country, we’d be tolerating more than 500 crashes every day.Taliancich, who spent much of his career in Air Force space-launch operations, shows me where the Starliner crew capsule will fit and points out the entryway into a sealed chamber that will ensure the cabin remains pristine when the astronauts enter it.I’d seen a Starliner an hour or so earlier in a nearby assembly plant. More accurately, I’d seen the upper and lower halves of the conical capsule without their outer heat-shielding shells, revealing the mind-boggling spaghetti mix of tubes, wires, and electrical cables that go into a spacecraft.With improved seats and larger windows, as well as interior LED “mood lighting,” this spacecraft’s cabin is clearly a 21st-century upgrade from an Apollo capsule. While the lighting feature sounds a bit whimsical, it’s anything but. Eventually, advanced lighting may help regulate astronauts’ circadian rhythms and sleep cycles as well as their emotions, one of several critical challenges that must be overcome before NASA or any other space agency can send humans on the months-long trip to Mars.Just when will that Mars trip finally occur?NASA does not have a specific timeline for human exploration of the red planet. In the meantime, the focus is on sending astronauts back to the moon as a way to test both human and spacecraft capabilities.“The moon is the proving ground; Mars is the horizon goal,” NASA’s Bridenstine said in March during a presentation at Cape Canaveral unveiling the space agency’s proposed budget.To establish a presence on the moon, astronauts will need to look at ways of extracting water, oxygen, and helium—as fuel for human and machine alike. (Helium-3, a gas thought to exist in significant quantities there, could be used for future nuclear fusion–propelled rockets.) The moon could also wind up as a staging ground for launches to elsewhere: Since it has only one-sixth of Earth’s gravity, much less energy is needed to send a ship beyond the moon’s pull than here on our planet.Space-exploration advocates are unhappy with the budget, saying it provides for a too-slow timetable for getting to Mars. Bridenstine counters that it incentivizes private industry to speed up capabilities for a crewed landing, and he frequently invokes the frenemy of comic character Charlie Brown to make his case that the path to Mars is genuine: “This is not Lucy and the football anymore,” he says. The Starliner—or the SpaceX version, called Crew Dragon, or both—may well be the future of human space exploration.Still, let’s return to Earth and reiterate a few things about where we are today.We’re manifestly not where many thought we’d be 50 years on, and certainly not where NASA’s Paine said we could be, which was not only Mars but also the moons of Jupiter and who knows where else. We’re not even back on the moon. Paine, who died in 1992, believed that thousands of us would be enjoying lunar vacations in his lifetime.“There’s no question we can reduce the cost of travel to the moon to the cost of traveling through air today,” Paine told Time magazine shortly before the Apollo 11 landing.It’s certainly possible that the big predictions of 1969 will come true—but closer to the 100th anniversary of the lunar landing, with this half-centennial milestone marking the beginning of Space Age 2.0.Musk, who says he intends to move to Mars someday, is the most aggressive on a time frame. He’s pegged 2024 for a crewed SpaceX spaceship to land on Martian soil, a projection widely dismissed as hopelessly—or recklessly—optimistic. In April a U.S. government–mandated independent analysis concluded that it was “infeasible under all budget scenarios and technology development and testing schedules” for NASA to send humans to Mars before 2034. Other Mars advocates say the early 2040s is more like it.Landing and exploring: doable. But, to be clear, many experts consider bold projections of celestial living to be, pardon the pun, lunacy.I ran into Bill Nye, the popular and pithy Science Guy of television fame and CEO of the Planetary Society, at a space conference last year in Washington, D.C., and he rolled his eyes at the idea that Mars will eventually be “terraformed” for human habitation.“It’s incredibly cold, there’s hardly any water, there’s no food, and by the way, there’s nothing to breathe,” Nye said. “And the smell in your space suit—bring all the Febreze you can pack, because you’re going to be craving it on Mars.” (Nye does favor missions to the red planet, just not permanent habitation.)The other thing to reiterate: Anything we can do, our robots can do better (in space, that is), with the exception of capturing the majesty of what’s there as only an artist or poet could. We’ve done amazing things in space without sending people there, and not just because we’ve launched all those satellites into orbit that have propelled quantum leaps in how we communicate, navigate, prognosticate—on the weather, anyway—and do countless other things here on Earth.Probes keep sending back detailed images, and soon we will be launching a telescope into space so powerful that it will enable us to peer at faraway objects whose light originated billions of years ago. This may help us answer questions about the early universe and perhaps even locate life elsewhere in the cosmos.Those remarkable twin Voyager probes, launched in 1977 and fueled by tiny nuclear-powered generators, are still returning data about the environment around them, sent by a radio transmitter that uses about as much power as a standard light bulb. That makes for a faint signal, but here on Earth we can “hear” what the Voyagers have to say because we’ve developed antennas sensitive enough to pick up the signal.“Amazing” strikes me as far too limited a word to describe our most far-flung emissaries, which indeed are diplomats in that they each carry the legendary “Golden Record” of earthly sounds, music from around the world, and greetings from Jimmy Carter (the U.S. president at launch time) to inform and entertain any sentient aliens that might encounter them.That the Voyagers are still hurtling through the heavens illustrates a serious point.Humans simply couldn’t make this trip. With our nettlesome need for air and food and water, protection from cosmic radiation or solar flares, not to mention stimulation so we don’t go mad on the long journey to wherever, it’s worth asking: Why go at all? Why go, especially when there is basically nothing to be done that a robotic probe cannot do more efficiently, quickly, cheaply, and safely than a human being? Let’s face the truth: From mining asteroids for rare materials to snapping photos of other planets, uncrewed probes are better suited to the job.Yet this raises the question of whether it’s important for us to explore. No un-crewed journey—even one of billions of miles—will ever generate quite the thrill, suspense, or awe of a man putting the first footprint on our nearby moon—or a woman doing so someday on Mars. (The next American to step on the moon, Bridenstine says, will likely be a woman.) If members of the human species are driven to scale Mount Everest or slog to the poles, isn’t there an inevitable urge onward to Mars and beyond? It’s … you know … what we do.“There’s a fundamental truth to our nature: Man must explore,” Apollo 15 commander David R. Scott radioed in 1971 to ground control in Houston from his spot near Hadley Rille, a valley on the moon. “And this is exploration at its greatest.”There’s also the matter of what some futurists call an “insurance policy” for the survival of the species and others call our Plan B in case Earth itself were to become uninhabitable. That could happen through a force beyond our control, like the asteroid that seems to have annihilated the dinosaurs, or by our own folly, through nuclear war or drastic derangement of our climate.We’ve been worried about Plan A, and that’s a good thing, because it’s by far the best plan we have, and it may be the only one. As the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben puts it, the least hospitable patch of Earth is still far more hospitable to human life than any reachable spot we have found anywhere else.The central irony of the first space age was that the most iconic images it yielded were not those of the moon or the other planets, but the ones of our own planet. “Earthrise,” our serene-looking blue orb swaddled in swirling clouds over the moon’s horizon, is the most famous. These photographs galvanized the environmental movement, spurred new laws to clean our water and air, and prompted a lot of people to ask a simple question: “Shouldn’t we be spending all that money to fix our own problems first?”The “all that money” part referred to the space program, which in some years consumed 4.5 percent of the federal budget. (Today NASA’s budget is half of one percent.) Getting men and women to Mars before now could easily have cost at least that much, so there’s a pretty good case to be made that we’ve been right to take a pass so far.We’re now entering that second space age, in which relentless innovations such as reusable rockets are driving down the cost of getting there. It will surely prove much less expensive to get to Mars in another decade or three than it would be today, and certainly less than it would have been in the 1980s. That’s a good bargain, even if those of us who watched Neil Armstrong kick up a little moondust never dreamed that it would take that long.How much longer remains the wild card.A serious accident or tragedy in any space venture tends to set back all of them, sometimes by years. Funding is hardly bottomless: For the moment, for instance, plans for asteroid mining seem to have stalled a bit. It may or may not be true that (as the industry’s cheerleaders contend) there’s a trillion dollars or more to be harvested from rare minerals out in space, but what if it takes $100 billion or $200 billion to develop the technology to try to find out? That’s a lot of money to wager that your unicorn will come in.Finally, space has a dark side, and not just the vast empty blackness that astronauts who have been through it describe. With the United States, China, and Russia all developing space weaponry (for defensive purposes, all three insist), we could find ourselves fighting a future war in space, launching missiles, destroying satellites, and training powerful laser weapons on earthbound targets, including people.To excavate, haul, and dump the layer of dust and rocks found on the surface of the moon, NASA designed a mobile robotic platform called RASSOR, shown here at the Kennedy Space Center. To operate in a low-gravity environment, it has counter-rotating bucket drums that are not dependent on traction or weight.On my way to the Soyuz rocket launch in Kazakhstan, I stopped first in Moscow to meet with a few cosmonauts and visit some museums, because it’s hard to appreciate how NASA’s astronauts got to the moon without understanding the challenge posed by the Soviet space program that spurred them there.Americans tend to view the push to the lunar landing as they would, say, a football game. Nobody really remembers or cares who was ahead during most of the contest; the important thing is who won, even if they had to come from three touchdowns behind to do it. By that score, the U.S. triumphed. End of story.But in Russia, where Soviet-era cosmonauts are national icons, you come away with a Bizarro World view of a completely different space race.In the Russian telling, the whole thing was more of a track meet, and they killed on points, even if the Americans bagged a prestige event at the end.The list of Soviet firsts in space is indeed impressive, from the first satellite, dogs, man, and woman in space to the first multiperson crew and space walk. It’s enough to make any American appreciate the magnitude of our national humiliation in space at the hands of our Communist adversaries at the height of the Cold War and why President John F. Kennedy’s pledge to land astronauts on the moon and return them to Earth by the end of the 1960s was such a brilliant gambit to recoup prestige on the global stage.Interestingly, the cosmonauts I met in Russia seemed to share two perspectives with their American counterparts. First, their time in space made them profoundly more interested in protecting the Earth. (Indeed, two cosmonauts gave me books they had written—not on space, but on protecting our environment.) Second, even while strongly favoring human space exploration, they think the idea of permanent, widespread human colonization of space is bonkers.“It’s not … pleasant, actually,” Viktor Savinykh said after a long pause when I asked him about living in space.Savinykh, 79, is famous in Russia for his role in the daring repair of a crippled, ice-encrusted, and dangerously out-of-orbit Salyut space station in 1985. “You get disoriented so easily, you can’t remember things up there,” he continued. “It’s really hard on the brain. All that sun in your eyes. It’s hard to describe. Your body weakens.”Still, he acknowledged that Bezos’s vision could come to pass someday.“I don’t have the answers to this,” Savinykh told me. “The new generation and then the next and then the next—they will get to decide. We did our part.”Those generations are certainly going to ask intriguing questions. Toward the end of the space conference I’d attended in Washington, a panel of U.S. astronauts fielded videotaped queries sent in by schoolkids from around the world.“Is it possible,” a five-year-old boy from Baltimore named Braith Ortenzi wanted to know, “to get from galaxy to galaxy?”“I’m glad he’s thinking big!” replied Chris Ferguson, a veteran of three space shuttle missions who’s slated to be on the first Boeing Starliner trip to the space station. “We’re going to have to master this whole light-speed thing,” he added as the audience broke into laughter, “before we get galaxy to galaxy.”“He’ll develop the technology to do it!” interjected Victor Glover, an astronaut slated for the first SpaceX Crew Dragon flight.“Please take us,” said Nicole Stott, a retired astronaut and veteran of two trips to the space station. “Take us with you!”Glover, nodding with a huge grin, had the final word: “It’s on you, brother!”",
"Tensions ran high at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the morning of April 12, 1961, as the Soviet Union prepared to launch the first human into space. Of the 16 previous attempts to propel the U.S.S.R.’s Vostok rocket into orbit, half had failed. Two of the space program’s top engineers reportedly had to take tranquilizers that day as they waited for liftoff at the Kazakh launch site.But Yuri Gagarin remained calm in the capsule atop the rocket. After months of rigorous physical and technical training, the 27-year-old cosmonaut had been chosen for the historic flight in part for his unflappability. Intelligent, diligent, and well-liked among his comrades, one memo written by Soviet Air Force doctors and obtained by historian Asif Siddiqi noted that Gagarin “understands life better than a lot of his friends.”At 9:07 a.m., Gagarin called out “Poyekhali!”—Russian for “Off we go!”—as the rocket lifted off. He narrated his experiences to those on the ground as the rocket’s acceleration to 17,000 miles an hour pushed him back into his seat. “I see the Earth. The g-load is increasing somewhat. I feel excellent, in a good mood. I see the clouds. The landing site ... it's beautiful. What beauty.”Moments later, the Soviet cosmonaut became the first person in space and, 89 minutes after launch, the first person to orbit the planet. It was a pivotal moment in the space race between the United States and Soviet Union that would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. But it isn’t where the story of human spaceflight truly begins: That trajectory was charted years earlier by another Soviet success.(Subscriber exclusive: Explore 50 years of lunar visits with our newest moon map.)Despite being allies during World War II, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. grew increasingly suspicious of one another as the war drew to a close in 1945. The U.S. had just demonstrated its ability to destroy entire cities by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan’s surrender. Thus began the Cold War, in which the U.S. and U.S.S.R. jockeyed for world dominance.To prove their superior technological capabilities, both countries began to build massive nuclear arsenals and rockets capable of hitting targets across the world. In the mid-1950s, both countries announced plans to use these rockets to propel artificial satellites into space. While the U.S. scheduled a 1958 launch for its Project Vanguard, the Soviets quietly resolved to beat the Americans to the punch.On October 4, 1957, the world was taken by surprise when the Soviet Union announced that it had launched a satellite called Sputnik, Russian for “traveling companion,” into orbit. Although it was no larger than a beach ball and had limited technical capabilities, Americans were frightened as they heard its radio signature “beep, beep, beep” as it passed overhead.President Dwight Eisenhower had his own concerns. White House officials fretted over whether the world would see the Soviet Union as the more sophisticated superpower, writing in one report that Sputnik’s launch would “generate myth, legend and enduring superstition of a kind peculiarly difficult to eradicate or modify, which the U.S.S.R. can exploit to its advantage.”Unwilling to concede space to the Soviet Union, the U.S. established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in July 1958 and began its own pursuit of spaceflight in earnest.Human space travel was not a novel concept in the 1950s. The U.S. had been launching rockets with animals—including fruit flies and rhesus macaques—into suborbital space since the late 1940s, while the U.S.S.R. began launching dogs in 1951. Just weeks after Sputnik’s 1957 launch, the Soviets famously sent a dog named Laika into orbit. (Laika died within hours of the flight from heat and stress.)(Subscriber exclusive: See a visual timeline of every animal ever sent to space.)But the true goal was to send humans to space. In 1958 NASA launched Project Mercury with three specific goals: Launch an American into orbit around Earth, investigate the human body’s ability to tolerate spaceflight, and bring both the spacecraft and astronaut home safety. The unstated goal: Accomplish all of this before the Soviets.Yet once again the U.S.S.R. proved a step ahead. Gagarin’s historic flight took place a month before astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space on May 5, 1961. Although Shepard’s 15-minute suborbital flight aboard Freedom 7 was a key milestone—watched by millions of television viewers—it was overshadowed by Gagarin’s journey all the way around Earth.Weeks after Shepard’s flight, President John F. Kennedy stood before a joint session of the U.S. Congress. Acknowledging that the country hadn’t treated space exploration with enough urgency, he declared his intention to make it a priority and issued a new challenge: Put an American on the moon by the end of the decade.“No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish,” he said. “In a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon—if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation.”Before NASA could venture to the moon, however, its scientists and engineers had much to learn. The space agency pushed forward with Project Mercury, making astronaut John Glenn the first American to orbit Earth in February 1962. In May 1963 Gordon Cooper completed a 22-orbit flight, a journey that took about 34 hours and 20 minutes. A month later, though, cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky spent four days and 23 hours in space—still the record for the longest solo spaceflight—and Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to fly to space.After Mercury, NASA advanced its spaceflight capabilities with Project Gemini. Considered a bridge to the moon, Gemini’s goals were to rendezvous and dock in orbit, test atmospheric reentry maneuvers, and determine how longer periods of space travel affected humans.Meanwhile, the Soviets were still logging milestones. In March 1965 cosmonaut Alexei Leonov became the first person to exit an orbiting spacecraft. Lasting 12 minutes, the spacewalk was particularly harrowing: Leonov’s spacesuit was so rigid he had difficulty reentering the spacecraft and ultimately had to release some of his suit’s pressure to close the airlock behind him.Ten weeks later Ed White became the first American to walk in space, spending 23 minutes floating at the end of a 25-foot umbilical line while he and astronaut James McDivitt in the Gemini 4 capsule circled Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. After that the U.S. began to gain on the Soviets: In December 1965 the astronauts aboard Gemini 7 set the record for the most time in space during a two-week mission. Gemini 8 achieved the first space docking in 1966—though a malfunction sent the spacecraft spinning out of control, to be narrowly recovered by a 35-year-old Neil Armstrong in the commander’s seat.After 10 crewed flights in five years, the program ended with Gemini 12 on November 15, 1966—a mission during which Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin logged a record-setting five hours and 30 minutes exploring outside a spacecraft. At last it was time to go to the moon.As it conducted the Gemini missions, NASA had already begun developing the spacecraft for the Apollo program. The vehicle included a command/service module that would fly to the moon and enter orbit, and a lunar module that would undock for landing and then blast off to rejoin the command module for the return trip to Earth.But the Apollo program got off to a tragic start. On January 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire on the launchpad during a ground test for their planned February mission. An investigation concluded that the fire was sparked by a short circuit in the wires near Grissom’s seat, and that it spread quickly due to high oxygen levels and flammable materials in the cabin.Following a lengthy reevaluation of the design and safety of the spacecraft, the first crewed Apollo mission launched on October 11, 1968, when Apollo 7 blasted into Earth orbit. On the first of 11 days in space, the three astronauts aboard came down with colds—learning the hard way that mucus cannot drain from the head in the weightlessness of space.The mission was followed by the first flight all the way to the moon, more than 230,000 miles away. Before Apollo 8, the farthest humans had been from Earth was about 850 miles. The crew orbited the moon 10 times between December 24 and December 25, reading the opening lines of Genesis to a captivated audience of roughly a billion people—a quarter of the global population—during a Christmas Eve radio broadcast. The three astronauts were the first to see the far side of the moon with their own eyes and watch as Earth rose over the lunar horizon.Apollo 9 was the first flight with the lunar module, testing the spacecraft in Earth orbit. Apollo 10 took the lunar module to the moon and descended to within 50,000 feet of the surface.Finally on July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 blasted off. On the fifth day in space, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin began preparations to land the lunar module Eagle on the moon’s surface. They touched down at precisely 3:17 p.m. Houston time on July 20—and hours later, at 9:56 p.m., Armstrong became the first person to step on the moon, famously proclaiming: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”Over the next two hours, Armstrong and Aldrin collected soil and rock samples and set up experiments. They left an American flag planted on the moon’s surface and a plaque that reads, “We came in peace for all mankind.”The U.S. would make five more successful crewed trips to the moon’s surface in the years that followed. Astronauts collected samples, ran scientific experiments, and tested a lunar rover. The program ended in December 1972 with Apollo 17, which saw astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spend more than three days on the moon.(A brief history of moon exploration.)After the successful missions to the moon, the U.S. and the Soviet Union began to collaborate. In 1975 the countries launched their first joint mission, Apollo-Soyuz, in which American and Soviet spacecraft successfully docked with one another while in orbit—allowing their crews to meet in space. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the U.S. and Russia continued their partnership in space, working together to build the International Space Station.Several countries have since made uncrewed journeys to the moon, but the U.S. remains the sole country whose astronauts have set foot on the lunar surface. NASA intends to return astronauts to the moon by 2025 with its Artemis program, and other countries such as China also plan to send humans to the moon in the coming years or decades.In the future, humans may venture all the way to Mars. Such a journey would require technologies that do not exist yet—but the same was true when the Apollo program was announced six decades ago.“We choose to go to the moon,” Kennedy told the nation in a 1962 address. “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.”",
"The moon, Earth’s sole natural satellite, is our constant companion. It has circled our planet for billions of years, since before the first sparks of life flickered in the oceans—before Earth was even cool enough to have oceans.But its seemingly tranquil position in modern night skies stems from a remarkably tumultuous past. It formed some 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system was in its infancy and comets, meteors, and asteroids ricocheted throughout. One such collision, between Earth and a Mars-sized orb, likely flung molten rock out into space, some of which coalesced and cooled to form what we now know as the moon.This early formation and close ties with young Earth makes the moon one of the most promising places to explore the birth and development of our solar system and home planet. The moon also preserves many of its ancient features: Unlike Earth, it doesn’t have plate tectonics to continually reface the landscape, nor does it have wind and rain wearing down ancient rocks.Generations of astronomers have studied this small airless world, from its pockmarked surface to its dense iron core. It’s the only other world humans have yet set foot upon—and a prime candidate for future visits. (Explore 50 years of visits to the moon.)There are more than 190 moons orbiting the planets and asteroids in our solar system, and Earth’s moon is the fifth largest of the lot. It spans about 2,160 miles across, nearly a third the width of Earth, orbiting at an average of 30 Earth-widths away. (Learn more about the solar system’s many moons.)A full moon, captured in 2005 by a crew member of the International Space Station, appears to be rolling along atop Earth's deep-blue stratosphere.Every 27.3 days, the moon makes its way around our planet while also completing one turn on its axis. Known as synchronous rotation, this celestial dance means that the same lunar face always peers down at us. Viewed from Earth, the amount of the moon illuminated by the sun appears to wax and wane, creating the familiar cycle from new moon to crescent to full. This sequence is a combined result of the moon’s changing position relative to both the Earth and sun, requiring 29.5 days to complete one full lunar cycle. (Read about the phases of the moon and which month hosts a Sturgeon moon.)Even though the same side of the moon always faces Earth, there’s no true “dark side,” as many mistakenly call our lunar orb’s far side. Even the far side of the moon receives sunlight—we just can’t see it—and the section of the moon illuminated on any given day shifts depending on the moon’s position.During the Apollo missions, astronauts brought back 842 pounds of lunar rock, sand, and dust to Earth, allowing scientists to scrutinize the moon’s surface. From this they’ve learned a wealth of information about the moon’s formation and evolution. Early in its history, vast oceans of magma blanketed the moon, and as that magma slowly cooled and crystallized, the less dense minerals floated to the surface. Much of this ancient lunar crust is made up of the light-colored rock anorthosite, which we see from Earth as the bright sections of the moon. (Learn how what may be Earth’s oldest rock was found—on the moon.)After billions of years, however, that dazzling surface is now rife with dark tracks, speckles, and splotches. Many of these dark zones are vast swaths of lunar basalts, similar to the rocks that make up the Hawaiian islands. Known as maria, which is Latin for seas, these zones were formed when ancient volcanic eruptions of molten rock flooded to the surface. Scientists don’t think these eruptions are ongoing, and most of the lava likely burst free between three and four billion years ago.Some of the small wending dark tracks are also faults, or deep cracks in the surface. But these don’t form due to shifting tectonic plates, like fault lines on the surface of the Earth. Instead, many likely formed as the moon cooled and contracted, and others come from Earth’s deforming gravitational tug on the tiny world. While much of this activity happened long ago, a recent look at Apollo-era earthquakes suggests that not all is relegated to the past, hinting that Luna may not be not geologically dead as some once thought. (Read about the massive blob lurking under the moon’s biggest crater.)One of the most quintessential features of the moon is the array of overlapping craters punched into its surface. Studying these craters, combined with the geological dating of rocks brought back during the Apollo missions, helps scientists not only illuminate the moon and Earth’s history of bombardment but also calibrate a timeline for the ages of other solar system bodies.Like on Earth, beneath the lunar crust lies the mantle, but scientists still aren’t sure of its exact composition. Models and some recent finds suggest the upper zones of the mantle are composed of the minerals pyroxene and olivine. At the moon’s center lies a small iron-rich core, spanning roughly 300 miles across, as revealed by analyses of seismic waves passing through the moon’s interior using Apollo-era seismic records of lunar tremors.Once thought to be a parched landscape, scientists have found an increasing number of signs that the moon is wetter than we once thought. While liquid water can’t persist at its surface, researchers believe that water ice lingers in some of its permanently shadowed zones. Tiny glass beads from ancient volcanic eruptions also suggest that there’s a surprising amount of water locked up in minerals deep inside the orb. Remarkably, water also seems to be released as meteors collide with the moon’s surface—as much as 220 tons of water each year.Such reservoirs would provide a valuable resource for hydration and fuel for future human visitors, or even for long-term residents of proposed lunar bases that could serve as a jumping-off point for exploration deeper into space.The moon’s steady change between new and full provided a rhythm for generations of humans, who eventually crafted calendars marking the moon’s many phases and their effects on Earth’s surface. One of the most obvious lunar influences is seen in Earth’s tides. The moon’s gravitational tug causes one bulge of water to form on the nearest side of our planet and another on the side farthest away. As the Earth rotates, the part of Earth affected by the lunar pull shifts, creating a high tide about every 12 hours at any given spot.The moon also dampens the amount that Earth teeters on its axis, helping to keep our climate more stable. The wobble in our planet’s tilt affects how the sun’s energy is distributed across the Earth and can influence the frosty advance or retreat of ice ages. Without the moon, scientists estimate that our planet’s tilt could have varied by up to 85 degrees, causing wild swings in climate.But each year, the moon’s grip on our planet grows just a smidgen weaker as it drifts about one and a half inches farther into space. This slow expansion in the moon’s orbit is a result of its role in Earth’s tides. Our planet rotates a little bit faster than the moon’s orbit. So the tidal bulge that rises on the side of Earth nearest the moon spins just ahead of the orb. This drags the moon along, slightly speeding up its orbit and inching it away.Never fear, it’s unlikely the moon will fly away altogether. So our little glowing buddy will continue to loop around Earth as we continue our annual venture around the sun for millennia to come. That is, of course, until it’s shredded by our dying sun.",
"National Geographic has always been at the forefront of lunar mapping. As the Apollo program closed in on its goal, cartographers relied on photos from 1966 and 1967 orbiter missions to create the February 1969 hand-­painted map—considered the best reference at the time. Our newest version uses a mosaic of some 15,000 images and detailed height measurements from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has surveyed the entire surface. The moon is peppered with probes and landers, the legacy of human efforts to explore it.Read more about past—and future—travels to the moon in our July cover story “50 years after Apollo 11, a new moon race is on.”",
"Thetis Bay, near the very tip of Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, is about as far south as one can go in the Americas.Few people ever do. “This is but a bad place for Shipping,” Captain James Cook wrote in his journal in 1768, cautioning future visitors to keep clear of the seaweed. But the bay does provide some shelter from the region’s notoriously rough seas and battering winds. On a chilly, overcast day in February 2018, we launched a Zodiac craft from our ship, the Hanse Explorer, and maneuvered it through Thetis toward the shore, careful to avoid the thick blankets of kelp and the sandbanks emerging at low tide.I was there leading a National Geographic Pristine Seas expedition, in collaboration with the Argentine government, the regional government of Tierra del Fuego, and the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea. With me was my old friend and colleague Claudio Campagna, who co-founded the forum in 2004 and has dedicated his life to studying and protecting the marine mammals of Argentina. Our goal was to gather scientific information and produce a film to lay the groundwork for a new protected marine reserve in Argentina’s waters.Thousands of juvenile false southern king crabs (Paralomis granulosa) swarm a giant kelp forest near Cape Horn, Chile. The species is heavily fished in the region, and such large aggregations are extremely rare.Creating such reserves—national parks of the sea—is my life’s work. Over the past decade, our Pristine Seas team has partnered with local allies to help governments protect more than two million square miles of ocean from fishing and other threats. Our expeditions have taken us diving all over the world, from coral reef islands in the vast Pacific to the frozen archipelagoes of the Arctic.The expedition to the tip of Tierra del Fuego was especially important to me—not just for what we might be able to achieve but also because of a personal connection to the place. Back in 1973 Paul Dayton, my friend and scientific mentor, conducted groundbreaking research here. Braving polar winds, hail, and snow, and wearing only old-fashioned wet suits—as opposed to our modern dry suits—Paul and his buddies dived around Thetis Bay and Isla de los Estados (Staten Island) just to the east. They measured and counted giant kelps and the invertebrates living under the kelp forest canopies fringing the shores. Nobody had studied these underwater habitats, and part of our mission was to redo Paul’s surveys. I’ve seen firsthand the dramatic changes in other parts of our oceans caused by overfishing and climate change, the most conspicuous being the bleaching and death of coral reefs and the shrinking of Arctic sea ice during summer. What were we going to find here beneath the surface, 45 years after Paul’s visit?Claudio and I stepped on the beach and immediately realized we were walking on a mass grave. Old sea lion bones crunched underfoot with every step—the legacy of hunters in the first half of the 20th century. Some skulls had holes made by metal picks. There were jaws and teeth from huge old males and little juveniles. Sea lions and fur seals had been taken indiscriminately, mainly for pelts and for blubber to boil for oil.By Paul Dayton’s time, the Argentine government had protected these species by law, but they have yet to recover. According to researchers, local sea lion numbers are a fifth of what they were more than 70 years ago, possibly because of the dramatic decline of reproductive females and the vast footprint of industrial fishing.“In the past, people killed them directly,” Claudio said. “Now we’re depriving them of their food too.” Three days before our visit to Thetis Bay we’d seen a 360-foot-long supertrawler at the port of Ushuaia. Its nets were big enough to hold a dozen Boeing 747s. Such bottom trawlers and long-liners operate at the edge of the continental shelf of Tierra del Fuego, where the deep basin begins.Nearer to shore, the weather is so brutal most of the year that few go through the effort to dive at Thetis Bay and Isla de los Estados, but having arrived in relative calm, we were able to dive around the island for two weeks.The cold, nutrient-rich waters feed giant kelp forests that harbor one of the most magnificent marine ecosystems on the planet. Pillars reach from as deep as 150 feet to the surface, sometimes adding a foot and a half in a day. Giant kelps continue to grow once they reach the surface, creating a canopy through which sunlight filters as if through the stained glass of a cathedral.Shooting out of the surf, a southern sea lion bull nabs a southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) at Isla de los Estados. Southern rockhoppers venture offshore to catch fish, swimming together by the hundreds. There is safety in numbers—for most.Paul had graciously scanned and copied his handwritten notebooks for us; the pages were filled with detailed natural history observations from 1973. We carried them like treasure. Giant kelp forests all look the same from the surface, but underwater it’s a different story.Paul had found that every little bay had its peculiarities, sort of an ecological personality. In one bay the kelps were covered only by one or two species of clams; in another, by little soft corals; and in a third, by baby sea cucumbers with finely branched plumes for capturing food particles in the rich seawater.To our astonishment, the kelps in each bay still harbored the same species. The oceanographic conditions appeared to have remained similar here for the past half century: Climate change had made no permanent mark yet. This seemed a wonderful gift, and I felt a burst of joy.We were amazed as well by the abundance of life. Every square inch of the bottom was occupied by a living organism: white and yellow sponges, pink encrusting algae, lollipop-like sea squirts. Giant kelps bent to the seafloor from the weight of the mussels growing on them. Blue starfish gorged on the mussels, along with snails and hermit crabs. A year before, on the Chilean side of this ocean ecosystem not far from Cape Horn, we’d stumbled upon a massive aggregation of another crab species, called false southern king crabs. Two layers of them covered the bottom while many more climbed the giant kelps and parachuted down on their fellow crustaceans—and on our heads. It was as if we were part of a Japanese science fiction film. Crabzilla!One day we took a break from the diving and ventured to the basin beyond the edge of the continental shelf. The Yaganes Basin is the heart of a massive, connected ocean ecosystem that ranges across the southern tip of Chile and Argentina to Antarctica, in a convergence of Pacific, Atlantic, and Antarctic waters. Our engineer, Brad Henning, had brought along several National Geographic Dropcams, glass (borosilicate) spheres enclosing cinema-grade cameras and lights. They have a weight system that carries the camera to the bottom, then returns it to the surface hours later—perhaps with a trove of never seen before footage of the seafloor.The Dropcams did not disappoint. When Brad showed us a selection of video clips the cameras had captured, our jaws dropped. Toothfish, hake, and other deep-sea fishes flocked to the bait Brad had attached to the Dropcam. At one point a fat red squid approached the camera, then vanished in an explosion of ink. Many of these species are overexploited in the basin. To see them still there means their populations can rebound, if humans let them.A large southern red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) rests on a bed of sea urchins at Isla de los Estados. Sea urchins are voracious kelp feeders, capable of denuding entire forests—but here the forests still thrive. Octopuses eat fish and crabs, dead and alive.After the expedition we changed from wet suit to business suit to lobby Argentine government officials for ocean protection along with our partners at the Forum for Conservation of the Patagonian Sea and Tompkins Conservation. Alex Muñoz, Pristine Seas director for Latin America, presented the results of our expedition to the government, in support of a plan to create the Yaganes marine park. We also premiered our documentary film from the expedition in Buenos Aires, bringing the marine wonders of Yaganes and Tierra del Fuego to Argentine leaders and citizens.In December the Argentine Parliament convened an extraordinary session to consider the proposal. We were all nervous. We knew that the National Park Administration and some key leaders in government supported protection of the area. But under Argentine law, the bill to authorize the park had to be approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate.Krill swarm inside a giant kelp forest at Islas Diego Ramírez, 60 nautical miles southwest of Cape Horn. Krill form the base of an enormous food web, supporting fish, penguins, sea lions, fur seals, whales, and—atop the web—orcas, among the ocean’s most formidable predators.After some tense negotiations, the House voted on December 5. I was astonished. The bill passed on a vote of 196 to zero—as resounding an affirmation for conservation as I’ve ever witnessed in any country. The Senate gave it the final blessing on December 12. Chile had already designated its own fully protected marine park south of Cape Horn a year earlier. Forty years ago Chile and Argentina had come to the brink of war over disputed territorial rights south of Tierra del Fuego. Now the presidents of the two countries would like to declare the area a marine peace park—possibly the largest contiguous transboundary protected oceanic area.“Today is a day of joy for all Argentines,” Claudio told me on the phone, after the park bill was signed into law. But the joy isn’t only for Argentines. Having had the privilege of exploring and documenting these waters, I feel that the ocean has won a little bit back against our relentless quest to empty it of life. Thanks to the leadership of two governments, the integrity of the great ecosystem of the sea at the end of the world will be maintained for years to come.",
"Enric Sala has made it his mission to save wildlife and habitat. In the past 10 years alone, thanks to his efforts and partnerships with governments around the world, an area half the size of Canada has been protected from all manner of human exploitation.The reserves that marine ecologist Sala has helped establish aren’t on land but in the oceans. His Pristine Seas project, sponsored by the National Geographic Society, has been instrumental in getting more than two million square miles set aside—keeping untouched wild areas healthy and giving depleted ones a chance to recover.Sala’s article this month recounts how Pristine Seas lent support to the creation of a protected marine park at the tip of Argentina. It’s next to waters that Chile designated as a park, and Sala believes it’s the largest contiguous transboundary protected ocean area in the world. Yet it’s not nearly enough. “Five percent of the ocean is protected,” he told me during a recent visit. “Science says half the ocean must be protected to make a real difference.”Of all the reserves he’s worked on, I asked Sala, which one does he like the best? “That’s like asking which of your sons or daughters you love the most,” he complained. But, he conceded, “there is one place: the Southern Line Islands, the most pristine archipelago in the Pacific. There, in 2016, we saw the greatest El Niño year ever, and half the corals bleached and died.”His team’s going back this year to see if the area has recovered. If it has, he says, “it will give us hope”—an essential commodity as Sala and his collaborators press on to protect more ocean life.Thank you for reading National Geographic.",
"We see evidence of the kill first: a shockingly broad spread of scarlet, probably the blood of a ringed seal, on snow-covered sea ice. Then the polar bear appears. She’s big, maybe 500 pounds, trailed by a single cub. They’ve just jumped into a lead—a long fissure of open water in the frozen sea. In seconds they’re out of the water again, running across the ice, spooked by the approach of our helicopter. Prolonged running can harm polar bears: Fat and fur insulate them so well they risk overheating. François Létourneau-Cloutier, our 33-year-old Québécois pilot, takes us higher, and the mother and cub slow to an amble.After following them for several minutes, Létourneau-Cloutier sets the helicopter gently onto the ice a few hundred feet away and cuts the engine. The mother rises on her hind legs, assessing our 35-foot-long flying machine with the unruffled gaze of the Arctic’s top predator; the cub remains on all fours behind her. For a few timeless moments we savor the scene—bears against an otherwise empty immensity of snow and ice, countless shallow pools of meltwater reflecting a high summer sun ringed by faint halos of red and blue. Then, with a frenzied whine, the helicopter’s rotor blades break the spell, and we lift off, veering southwest toward our campsite on the northernmost tip of Baffin Island, Canada, about 700 miles north of Hudson Bay.Within a few decades such vistas are unlikely to exist, at least not here, during summer. As the planet heats up, the summer sea ice and all the superbly adapted life it supports—the bears, the seals, the walruses, the whales, the Arctic cod, the crustaceans, the ice algae—may well vanish around Baffin. As we fly over the vast frozen expanse, it almost strains belief to think that we’re witnessing—and with the rest of humanity, helping to cause—its demise. In the 1980s satellite data showed that Arctic sea ice extended on average across nearly three million square miles at the end of summer. Since then more than a million square miles has been lost—an area roughly the size of Alaska, Texas, and California combined.Climate models suggest that by the 2050s, less than 200,000 square miles of perennial sea ice will remain. The good news, such as it is: What’s left will collect in a compact region, not here but farther north, above Greenland and Canada’s Ellesmere Island. That shrunken redoubt will be the last stand for many of the Arctic’s wild things.“The animals that depend on the edge of the sea ice for a living will be congregating there in the summer,” says marine ecologist Enric Sala, leader of the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project. “It will be like one of those watering holes in Africa where everybody shows up.”Sala has come to Baffin with divers and filmmakers to document the icy world that’s doomed here—and to make the case for preserving the “last ice” farther north. Since he started Pristine Seas a decade ago, the project has helped protect more than three million square miles of ocean. But preserving the remnants of Arctic ice, which will require the cooperation of Greenland and Canada, will be its most ambitious undertaking.It’s also the most urgent. “The Arctic is changing faster than anything else,” Sala says, and as the ice goes away, shipping, fishing, and oil and gas development may intrude. If sea ice and its denizens are to be protected, it must happen before exploitation of Arctic resources becomes unstoppable. With the last-ice project, Sala says, “we’re looking 25 years ahead.”In satellite photos, and perhaps in our imaginations, the icescape glazing the top of our world appears static, like a featureless white continent, permanent and immobile. Actually it’s a jostling mass of ice floes that, propelled by winds and currents, drift from one side of the Arctic to the other in journeys lasting years.“People don’t understand the Arctic,” says Stephanie Pfirman, an oceanographer at Barnard College and Columbia University. “They think of it as an ice cap. They think that it’s rigid and that when it melts it’s just melting back on the edges. They don’t think of this dynamic aspect of it.”In 2010 Pfirman was part of a team that identified the most likely location for the Arctic’s last summer sea ice, work that has helped guide the Pristine Seas effort. Comparing a variety of computer models and satellite data, she and her colleagues found that winds and currents conspire to funnel drifting sea ice from all over the Arctic onto the northern edges of Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago—a region of spectacular fjords and more than 36,000 islands, including Ellesmere and Baffin. Year after year, massive ice floes stack up in that relatively calm zone. Some of the ice there is decades old and more than 80 feet thick.Pfirman and her colleagues realized that by mid-century, this frigid haven would hold the Arctic’s only year-round ice. Their discovery was far from obvious. In some earlier climate models, Pfirman says, the Arctic’s ice cover simply retreated evenly along its southern flank as the planet warmed, ultimately settling right around the North Pole. “That makes no sense at all, though,” she says. “There’s no reason for ice to congregate at the North Pole. It’s going to keep moving until it hits something.”Despite the steep decline in store over the next several decades, a long, narrow band of perennial ice will persist late into this century. If we can end our reliance on planet-heating fossil fuels, it could survive even longer—into a time when, just maybe, we’ll figure out how to remove enough carbon from the atmosphere to cool the planet again. “The ice models don’t drop down to zero,” Pfirman says. “Some people say it’s hopeless, because we’re on a trajectory where ice is going to be lost. But if you look at the climate models, it drops down precipitously, and then it has this long tail, which gives us some time to act and potentially mitigate the warming.”The ice that does remain in the Arctic may provide a stable environment, albeit a compact one, for organisms that depend on ice. “For people concerned about habitats, it’s not that you will sometimes have the summer ice off the coast of Siberia and sometimes have the ice in the Beaufort Sea,” Pfirman says. “Because you couldn’t sustain a habitat if that ice was moving all around. It’s actually pretty consistently going to be banked up off the coastlines of Greenland and Canada.”“This is a newcomer,” says Theo Ikummaq, stooping and pointing to a delicate green shoot on the rocky beach near our campsite. Ikummaq, a 60-year-old native of Igloolik, an island off of Baffin, is a guide and adviser for our expedition. It’s a cold and foggy June afternoon; the inlet we’re walking along is still frozen. Clouds have covered the sun for days now. Ikummaq carries a rifle over his shoulder in case we need to scare away polar bears. We’ve already spotted the tracks of one in the sand only a few hundred yards from our camp.The little green shoot, maybe a couple of inches high, has no name in the Inuit dialect spoken in this part of the Arctic. Ikummaq doesn’t recognize it; he knows only that it’s another example of how the land and life are changing here. During our walk we’ve passed what Ikummaq says are new features in the landscape: large circular sinkholes, created by thawing permafrost.Later that day, in the big tent where we have our meals, Ikummaq tells me the names for a few Arctic animals. An aarluk—“kills everything”—is a killer whale; a tingugliktuq—“bad liver, don’t eat”—is a horned lark. But some animals, such as robins, are so new to the Arctic that Ikummaq, at least, doesn’t know names for them.With global warming, plant and animal species from the south have started to move north. It’s a trend that will only accelerate, says Brendan Kelly, a biologist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. As the habitat for Arctic wildlife shrinks, the animals that survive are likely to undergo profound changes. Diverse species will be thrust into closer contact than ever before.“There’s the potential for a massive scrambling of genes in the whole Arctic Ocean,” Kelly says. “We did a survey of marine mammals and came up with 34 species that are capable of hybridizing.” For reasons that scientists don’t yet understand, marine mammals have tended to retain the same number of chromosomes—a key requirement for hybridization—as they diverged into different species and even genera.“So you end up with things that you would otherwise say are different genera, but are in fact able to produce fertile hybrid offspring,” says Kelly. “An example would be harp seals and hooded seals, which we classify as different genera—but we’ve seen them hybridize in the wild. There is some evidence of a hybrid between belugas and narwhals.” Pizzlies—crosses of grizzlies and polar bears—already roam the Arctic. Genetic studies show that polar bears began diverging from grizzly bears within the past 500,000 years. Global warming threatens to reunite the two species.“We could lose polar bears,” Kelly says. “They might be reabsorbed into the grizzly bear genome out of which they came. We’re not just talking about ecological change. We’re talking about evolutionary change—really sped up.”The end result, says Kelly, is likely to be a tremendous, irreversible loss of genetic diversity. But even if that weren’t the case, the Arctic’s wildlife would still be in trouble. “We’re changing the habitat so fast that even if they have the genetic diversity to respond, they may not have the time.” For some of the world’s iconic species, the last-ice region could make the difference between survival and extinction.“Peaceful, isn't it?” Enric Sala is smiling as he joins me on the beach in front of our camp’s double row of two dozen orange tents. We’re looking east across the frozen reaches of Navy Board Inlet toward Bylot Island, several miles away. Covered with mountains and glaciers, a refuge for denning polar bears and hundreds of thousands of nesting birds, it’s larger than the big island of Hawaii. The sun is out, the weather has finally lifted, and there’s barely any wind. After more than a week of waiting, Sala and his team of divers are eager to explore some open water around a couple of small islands off Bylot’s western shore. In a few weeks, algae will be in full bloom, the water will cloud, and underwater filming opportunities will vanish. But now, the sea here is just beginning to blaze with life.“Sunlight is like a lighter for this ecosystem; it’s why we’re here now,” says Manu San Félix, a diver and photographer who has joined us on the beach, wearing his dry suit. Over the next few days, if the weather holds, he, Sala, and other expedition members will record the beauty of what will be lost if we fail to protect the Arctic’s last ice.The harder work, more arduous even than diving in freezing water, will take years: persuading governments to cooperate to save a region that extends across borders. Preserving the last-ice region itself won’t be enough; because ice migrates long distances, its sources eventually will have to be protected as well. Right now, for example, Siberian ice contaminated with nickel and lead from the Russian industrial city of Norilsk—one of the world’s most polluted places—sometimes drifts into the Canadian Arctic. There it poisons the food web as it melts.“It’s a good sign that we are seeing narwhals, belugas, and polar bears,” says San Félix. It means the food chain here is still healthy. We talk about a pod of bowhead whales that were spotted during a helicopter flight the other day and about how their huge heads enable them to smash through two feet of ice. Bowheads can live 200 years or more. (One way their age has been determined is by carbon-dating old harpoon points embedded in their bodies.) The oldest of them now, says San Félix, might have been born when Napoleon was still alive. “Imagine!” he says. “That calf we filmed might be here in 2215!”If we’re lucky, that is, and foresighted enough. Says Sala: “This is not a simple, linear story where we know how it ends.”",
"Like some of its relatives, strawberry land hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) in the Seychelles spend considerable energy "remodeling" their shells, which they are reluctant to leave for any reason—even to mate.Hermit crabs are a common sight scuttling across warm beaches, but many of these charismatic crustaceans wield something surprising and hidden—very large penises, sometimes half the length of their shell-anchored bodies. New research suggests the crabs evolved such outsized organs to help them mate without straying far from home.Some of these hermits expend a lot of energy “remodeling” the inside of their shells, which unlike most crabs they of course cannot grow themselves, says Mark Laidre, a biologist at Dartmouth College and a National Geographic Explorer.These animals can whittle their shells and secrete erosive chemicals, allowing them to create a smooth and expansive interior. These refurbished homes give them space to grow and may even provide room for egg storage—making the shells extremely valuable. They are, in other words, not something that you’d like to leave—even temporarily—which many hermit crabs have to do to mate.But what if you could have a large enough sexual organ to reproduce without exiting your shell, which rivals may steal?While studying land-dwelling hermit crabs at Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, Laidre noticed that the animals’ penises, also known as sexual tubes, varied widely in size. But the species that did the most remodeling—and thus had the most valuable shells—had the largest penises.Laidre’s new study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that hermit crabs evolved bigger sexual organs to avoid becoming homeless.To test his “private parts for private property” hypothesis, Laidre took a closer look at the genitalia of land crabs in the genus Coenobita, but also set of related hermit crabs over a wide range of habitats and lifestyles. Some crabs modify their shells to varying degrees, while others do not. Some were tiny, tidepool residents, and others, like Petrochirus diogenes, are massive deep sea-dwelling animals.This male land crab (Coenobita compressus) has a prominent penis, and it normally carries a valuable, easily stolen shell.Laidre also included the watermelon-sized coconut crab—the world’s largest land-lubbing invertebrate—which doesn’t need a shell home.Upon measuring the penis-to-body-size ratio of more than three hundred museum specimens, Laidre found that the more extensively a given species’ shell was carved, the longer its penis was for its body size. Laidre even ruled out alternative hypotheses that could explain the pattern, like the possibility that penis length went up with body size, or that particular habitat types were responsible.This makes sense because terrestrial hermit crabs’ lives revolve around their protective shells. The cunning creatures are ruthless about spotting and stealing superior shell property from their neighbors.“They get into quite a lot of shell shenanigans, where individuals are constantly at risk of being evicted,” says Laidre, noting that remodeled shells are even more apt to being snatched away, since their smooth interiors are even harder for the crab to grip.Enlarged genitalia are “really a very sensible evolutionary solution to what is one of the most dangerous things [the crabs] can get involved in,” he says.Losing a remodeled shell makes fatal desiccation all but inevitable, and the crabs have become so specialized, they can’t even fit into unimproved shells as a temporary fix. “If these guys lose that shell, within 24 hours, they're doomed."Because of this, Laidre envisions the enlarged penises as an insurance policy for protecting a crucial investment, one that is bolstered by other behaviors that make sex as safe as possible.When mating, the two crabs face their shell openings towards each other and get as close as possible to allow the male to deposit sperm without either crab leaving the shell. (There is not penetration involved.) Laidre notes that the process is fairly speedy in remodeled shell species compared to other crabs, and executed in secretive locations, likely minimizing risk further.This is in stark contrast to coconut crabs, which have one of the smallest penis-to-body-size ratios among crabs in the study. Coconut crabs use remodeled shells as young but become too large to need them before maturity. With no shell to protect as adults, the danger in copulation erodes, as does the need for enlarged genitalia.“I thought this study was extremely clever,” says Justa Heinen-Kay, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in this study. “It is quite remarkable that these animals have actually evolved longer penises in order to stay close to home while copulating.”“It is quite unusual for an object to be involved in the evolution of sexual traits,” Heinen-Kay notes.",
"South American fur seals glide by National Geographic Pristine Seas divers in the waters of Yaganes off the southern coast of Argentina.Two new marine parks that together make up an area the size of Hungary have been created in the South Atlantic Ocean.One is called Yaganes and is located just off the southern tip of Argentina—a spot nicknamed “the end of the world.” The other, Namuncurá-Burdwood Bank II, is in the South Atlantic. Together, they make up 37,000 square miles of marine protected areas (MPAs) teeming with sea creatures, many of which are classified as threatened species.Portions of these new MPAs have remained pristine by default of their remoteness, and the Argentine government’s decision to protect them ensures that the marine ecosystems will stay that way. Conservationists are hoping this move signals a shift toward stronger conservation measures in the country. Not only because the decision designates more protected territory, but also because it comes with a legal framework to enforce the new restrictions.  “It's much more than creating two national parks,” says Sofia Heinonen, president of Fundación Flora y Fauna Argentina, an environmental group that led a campaign in favor of the new marine parks. “This also creates the basis for the next one.”Previously, Argentina's marine parks were managed by the same government department that manages its fisheries, which are open to commercial interests. This left little funding to stop illegal activity in the parks that could undermine bans on extractive activities like fishing there. An earlier Argentine MPA called Namuncurá-Burdwood Bank I, created in 2013, had weak oversight. A legal framework to manage the park wasn’t passed until 2015, and Argentina’s National Parks Administration didn’t gain control until 2017.At the same time, according to local media outlets, fishing pressure has increased immediately south of Argentina in recent years. So in an attempt to protect Argentina’s waters, the National Geographic Society partnered with the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea and local governments to survey the region. The goal was to assess the health of the marine ecosystems known for their impressive biodiversity.“We wrote very comprehensive scientific reports that supported the immense ecological value of this area and the need for protection,” says Alex Muñoz, the leader of the Latin American arm of National Geographic's Pristine Seas program. And earlier this year, Fundación Flora y Fauna Argentina and the National Geographic Society received part of a record $1 billion donation made by the conservation-focused Wyss Foundation to groups working to create natural reserves like marine protected areas and national parks.During National Geographic’s recent exploration of Yaganes and Namuncurá-Burdwood Bank, researchers and photographers maneuvered cameras more than 6,000 feet below the surface. They found underwater mountain ranges and deep-sea canyons home to an impressive array of diversity. Many of the species identified can only be found in this part of the world.So, too, with marine mammals. Yaganes was once a lucrative spot for hunting whales—an activity that severely impacted southern right whale populations. But since this hunting activity ended in Argentina after the country joined the International Whaling Commission in 1960, populations have slowly begun to rebound.With the creation of these two new marine protected areas, 8 percent of Argentina’s waters are now protected, bringing the country closer to its goal of protecting 10 percent of its national waters by 2020.MPAs are a popular tool used by governments to meet the United Nations’ larger goal of protecting 10 percent of the world’s oceans by 2020. By closing regions to activities like fishing, MPAs can allow fish stocks to recover, which then spill out to commercial areas. In a previous interview with National Geographic, former NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco likened MPAs to a shot of vitamin C before the onset of a cold.A March study, partially supported by Pristine Seas, found that many declared protected areas around the globe are not effectively enforced. And even with countries’ self-reported conservation declarations, the U.N. is predicted to fall short of it goal. But countries like Argentina aren’t giving up.“Argentina is catching up on marine conservation,” Muñoz says. “Now it's becoming a world leader in world conservation.”Heinonen says her organization’s future conservation work will involve talks with Chile, a country that also shares close proximity to Antarctica. They hope to create joint protected areas in the South Atlantic Ocean.",
"Conservation groups say protecting forests is one of the most effective ways to combat climate change. Forests, like those in the Amazon rainforests, act as carbon sinks, sucking excess carbon from the atmosphere.Humans are rapidly taming the world's wild places.In the past century, nearly 80 percent of all land has been modified or impacted by human development. As a result, other species have rapidly declined. One study estimates animals are going extinct 1,000 times faster than they would have without human influence.To fight that growing trend, conservation groups are increasingly turning to converting biologically rich lands into conservation plots like national parks and marine protected areas. Today, the Wyss Foundation, a charity focused on protecting wild places, announced they are donating $1 billion to launch the Wyss Campaign for Nature.Hansjörg Wyss says the money will go toward a U.N. goal to protect 30 percent of the Earth by 2030. Wyss is partnering with the National Geographic Society, the Nature Conservancy, and Argentine conservation group Fundacion Flora y Fauna.One of the four initiatives under the campaign will focus on empowering local groups to take up stewardship of their land in their region.Marine protected areas are on the of the most effective ways to protect biodiversity and ensure the health of fisheries.A Nature study published earlier this year showed that indigenous groups, despite only comprising five percent of the global population, manage 38 million square kilometers of land. By empowering these groups, environmentalists say wild areas will be better protected from outside influences like industrial development.President of Fundacion Flora y Fauna Sofia Heinonen says the group is currently in the process of buying land containing Argentinian mountain glaciers that provide drinking water to those living in the region. With the Wyss donation, the group will also train local community leaders and create more eco-tourism opportunities.In addition to purchasing biodiverse wilderness areas to be managed by national parks and conservation groups, the campaign will fund science that supports conservation measures, lead awareness campaigns, and lobby international governmental groups to raise targets.Mark Tercek, CEO of the Nature Conservancy, says these targets will be discussed at the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity “conference of the parties,” or COP, where these groups set targets.In addition to a COP coming up later this month in Egypt, Tercek says groups are already looking toward a 2020 COP, when major new targets for the next decade will be set.“We're behind schedule,” he says of where conservation should be. “Announcing this [Wyss] campaign should help global leaders at the 2020 COP get serious about meeting targets.”In an op-ed published this morning in the New York Times, Wyss touted the “Half-Earth” campaign created by famed biologist E.O. Wilson. The campaign aims to set aside half the planet for conservation, a move the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation says would preserve species and generate ecological benefits.Other initiatives under the new Wyss campaign will focus on creating awareness campaigns and scientific research.Helping people understand why nature is important and having the resources to do so are two of the biggest conservation roadblocks, says chief scientist at the National Geographic Society Jonathan Baillie.Setting aside land for conservation will contribute to fighting climate change, environmental groups concluded earlier this year at a conference in San Francisco. Large, forested regions like the Amazon rain forest act as carbon sinks, sucking carbon out of the atmosphere.Many of the last remaining wild places are in the far northern reaches of the U.S., Canada, and Russia.Wilderness also benefits many species, including human beings.In a new paper published today in Nature, scientists reveal that truly wild ecosystems untouched by humans are rapidly disappearing. Many of these regions are refuges for species close to extinction, says the paper's author, James Watson from the University of Queensland.Watson ultimately calls for a global target to be set for protecting wild regions and the designation of new natural world heritage sites.“The objective is to make sure we don't have mass extinctions and to make sure we have ecological services,” says Baillie referring to benefits nature can provide like keeping air and water clean.Earlier this week, a newly published World Wildlife Fund report argued that wildlife has declined by 60 percent globally in the past 40 years. Habitat loss is one of the biggest drivers of that species decline, in addition to climate change and pollution.By hitting the U.N.'s 2030 goal and ultimately E.O. Wilson's Half-Earth goal, Baillie says conservationists are hoping they can stop that rapid decline.",
"Can protecting forests help save the planet? Environmentalists are hoping the answer is yes.  A group of Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) and community leaders are gathering in San Francisco on September 12 to discuss solutions they hope will mitigate the impacts of climate change.  They're hoping to reach a solution they're calling 30x30. It's a target set specifically to reach goals set forth by the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce carbon emissions, and the organizations attending the summit think sustainably managed forests and land can meet 30 percent of the targeted emissions reduction.  What can forests do to reduce carbon emissions?  Large forests are capable of sucking up large amounts of carbon. Swaths of forest like those found in the Amazon, the largest forested region on the planet, act like a sink to remove emissions from the atmosphere.  Global Forest Watch, which monitors deforestation in real time, estimates that between 2001 and 2017, 800 million acres of tree cover was lost. Much of that was driven by agriculture, logging, and cattle ranching.  The San Francisco summit will focus on solutions that allow these industries to grow but under regulations that enforce sustainability.  Frances Seymour from the World Resources Institute says countries have the capacity to enforce sustainable forest management, but it's political will that stands between their goals and reality.“Brazil is a great example,” Seymour says of a country that has balanced industrial growth and sustainability.From 2004 to 2012, the country, which contains the largest portion of the Amazon rainforest, reduced deforestation by 80 percent.Seymour says it was thanks to a host of factors, like better law enforcement, recognizing indigenous peoples' land rights, and creating more protected areas that helped the country see environmental success. Since 2016, however, Brazilian deforestation has ticked up, which Seymour credits to shifting political will from the nation's federal government.Despite the setback, environmentalists and sustainable industry leaders in neighboring Peru still look to Brazil for inspiration in managing their protected areas.One way the country is trying to scale back deforestation is by offering logging concessions to businesses that pledge to log the forest sustainably. Maderacre is one such concession. It sits in the Madre de Dios region of Peru's southeastern Amazon Basin at the border of Bolivia and Brazil.The state has awarded Maderacre a concession containing 200,000 hectares on which they can harvest timber for 40 years. Unlike a traditional logging company, Maderacre harvests only one tree per two hectares to prevent converting large swaths of forests into razed land. Each year, they harvest trees from just 11,000 hectares of the concession, before moving to a new plot on a rotating annual basis. Of the plots of land that have been used for logging, new trees are then planted.Kroll says most of the timber from Maderacre is sold in Europe, and consumers by wood products thousands of miles away will see Maderacre's goods marked by the Forest Stewardship Council.Nelson Kroll has been working as a forest manager at Maderacre for 16 years and says fuel and labor are the biggest costs of working in the concession. He declined to disclose the concession's annual profit but says the business would be more profitable if they weren't operating sustainably. Trees like the towering shihuahuaco tree, for instance, grow for hundreds of years. Some in Maderacre are homes for endangered species like the harpy eagle.Kroll says one shihuahuaco tree can fetch $16,000 American dollars, a profit Maderacre forgoes when the tree contains important species. But the goal of the concession is not just to make a profit, notes Kroll, but rather to ensure forests can be a lucrative resource in the long term.Not all Peruvian forest concessions have been a success story, and a study published in 2017 found that some may enable illegal logging. By analyzing data from the Peruvian agency that oversees the countries 609 forest concessions, the study authors found that 43 percent had been cancelled or were under investigation for major violations.NGOs in Peru say they need more government funding for law enforcement and monitoring to ensure that sustainable forest management works.Representatives from environmental NGOs who are attending the upcoming San Francisco summit hope that engaging representatives who lead cities, states, and native communities will invigorate a grassroots political movement.It was the World Wildlife Fund who convened a stakeholders who work in different sectors related to forest management. In Peru, the WWF's local branch engaged with everyone from indigenous communities living in voluntary isolation to mayors of growing Amazon cities.According to Seymour, the timing of the summit is politically significant because it comes three years after the Paris Climate Agreement, but a year after the Trump administration submit a formal notice to the UN to withdraw from the agreement.“[The] state and local action is a response to that,” says Seymour.“To meet the 30 percent collective goal, those countries that can, must help to mobilize finance, including from private sector, for forest, food, and lands mitigation actions of developing countries,” says Peter Graham, the managing director of policy and research at Climate Advisers.Nigel Purvis, the former US chief negotiator on climate and now the CEO of Climate Advisers says this action will be everything from reforestation to creating more sustainable agriculture to cutting back on meat consumption.“It's not a one size fits all [approach],” he says.He adds that the 30 percent target was negotiated by the stakeholders attending the summit and that it's consistent with targets set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.To track progress, Climate Advisers is recommending that each stakeholder report their progress under the Paris Agreement’s Nationally Determined Contributions. Only a third of the 165 member countries under the agreement have quantified land sector targets—a lack of action the summit hopes to rectify.Without a U.S. commitment to the Paris Agreement, states like California have tried to compensate with policies like carbon cap and trade programs, but Seymour says, while significant, there’s no substitute for U.S. federal involvement when setting international agreements.Kurt Holle, the country director of WWF Peru, thinks private investment is the best way to create changes quickly and on a large scale. To him, the Peruvian Amazon has the potential to be the “Silicon Valley” of sustainable forest management.“This is a place where we can scale now and scale quickly,” says Purvis. “It has been a tiny part of the political attention and media attention. It's really the forgotten solution.”",
"The countries of Chile and Niue just made a huge splash in the world of ocean conservation.Niue, a tiny South Pacific island nation with a population of roughly 1,600, has turned 40 percent of its exclusive economic zone into a marine park, and Chile added two new marine parks where fishing and all other extractive activities are banned.Together, the three new parks protect some 290,000 square miles of ocean—an area more than twice the size of Germany.The two countries will announce their new marine protected areas (MPAs) at the Our Ocean conference, which runs in Malta on Thursday and Friday. The three reserves are scientifically supported by the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project.The Niue reserve encompasses the island itself, various seamounts and offshore reefs, and Beveridge Reef, an uninhabited, semi-submerged atoll. The move protects 49,000 square miles of ocean—more than 30 square miles for each man, woman, and child living on the island today.The feat is all the more impressive given Niue's size and stubbornly shrinking population. Like the similarly small Cook Islands, which have protected more than 700,000 square miles of ocean, Niue currently lacks representation in the UN. New Zealand represents both countries on the global stage.“It is no small feat for a small-island developing state to make such a tremendous and tangible contribution to ocean conservation,” says Brendon Pasisi, director of the Niue Ocean Wide (NOW) project, a public-private sustainability initiative in Niue.Niue decided to protect these waters amid concerns that its ecosystem and way of life are extremely vulnerable. Coral reefs throughout the central and western Pacific are hurting, as a changing climate brings warmer and more acidic waters. Overfishing has also pummeled open-ocean fish stocks, including wild tuna. The island's reefs are also still recovering from Heta, a Category-5 cyclone that dealt massive damage to Niue in 2004.At the suggestion of Niue's government and National Geographic Emerging Explorer Jessica Cramp, a team composed of Pristine Seas, NOW, and the philanthropic group Oceans 5 explored the island's waters in September 2016.(Visit National Geographic Encounter: Ocean Odyssey, a brand-new immersive experience in Times Square, New York City.)Led by Paul Rose, the 18-day expedition revealed dazzling marine life, including 300 species of fish, the little-known Blainville's beaked whale, and three species of globally endangered sea turtles. These data helped Niue decide which waters to protect.“We found some of the highest densities of reef sharks anywhere on Earth,” says University of Hawaii biologist Alan Friedlander, the chief scientist for Pristine Seas. “Shark populations have declined by more than 90 percent globally, so this new MPA (marine protected area) is an important refugee for these highly threatened species."  "We were amazed by what we found at Beveridge Reef — there were more sharks recorded by my BRUVS [underwater video systems] at Beveridge Reef than had been recorded anywhere in the world to date," adds Cramp, who joined the expedition to catalog Niue's sharks and rays.On the other side of the Pacific, Chile has unveiled two new reserves that protect 240,000 square miles of ocean from fishing and all other extractive activities—a combined area nearly the size of France.“Chile is a fishing country, and most fisheries there are fully exploited or overexploited, but this government has realized that there is no future of fisheries without significant protection,” says National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala, the executive director of Pristine Seas.One of the new reserves protects more than 45,000 square miles of ocean around the Diego Ramírez Islands, a small archipelago that rises from the tempestuous waters off South America's Cape Horn.Its waters host giant kelp forests and a mix of temperate and Antarctic species, including seals, sea lions, and whales. The islands also serve as vital nesting grounds for the rockhopper penguin, the black-browed albatross, and about 80 percent of the world’s population of blue petrels.At 187,000 square miles, the new marine park at Chile's Juan Fernández Islands is the largest of its kind in South America, and nearly all of the area's fish species are unique to the region. What's more, the fishermen who live in the Juan Fernández Islands have long been praised for their well-managed lobster fisheries—a lifestyle that locals hope the nearby marine park will help sustain.“The Juan Fernández fishing community has become a global model for marine conservation,” said Felipe Paredes, a Juan Fernández local leader, in a statement. “This large marine park will provide us shelter and sustenance forever.”Since 2010, Chile has designated more than 400,000 square miles of marine parks where all extractive activities are prohibited, an area bigger than Egypt. And last March, Chile made international headlines by designating some 10 million acres of new national parkland.Today's announcement comes after Chile announced a marine park around Easter Island, a Chilean territory, at the fourth International Marine Protected Areas Congress in September.Called Rapa Nui Rahui, the peanut-shaped, 278,000-square-mile swath of ocean is home to least 142 marine species found nowhere else on Earth. It is roughly as large as Chile itself.“This process has been one of the most extensive that I’m aware of,” says Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, which consulted on the reserve. “There were very long nights with many a cerveza, sitting with gruff fishermen who were very skeptical, [and] we worked on the island for a long time, bringing scientific analysis into the conversation.”Chile and the indigenous Rapa Nui community had been in formal negotiations over the reserve since late 2015; on September 5, the Rapa Nui voted in a referendum to move forward with it.Local leaders emphasize that the reserve will be co-managed by Chile and the Rapa Nui. Unlike the Chilean marine parks at Diego Ramírez and Juan Fernández, much of Rapa Nui Rahui will allow fishing—but only from artisanal Rapa Nui fishermen.Sala of Pristine Seas warns that even local, artisanal fishing within marine reserves like Rapa Nui Rahui can take a toll. He points to a 2017 study he coauthored showing that “no-take” marine reserves that fully ban extractive activities preserve markedly more biomass within marine ecosystems than those with only partial protections.Locals maintain that the designation will protect both Easter Island's waters and the Rapa Nui lifestyle.“Our people live from the ocean and for the ocean,” says Sebastián Yancovic Pakarati, a member of Mesa del Mar, a conservation-focused coalition of Rapa Nui business leaders, fishermen, and local organizations. “… This opportunity that we have now is the best and easiest way to take control of our own territory.”",
"The Sarara Conservancy in northern Kenya, where local pastoralists from 18 different ethnic groups manage their land for both livestock grazing and wild animals—in what some hail as a new model for conservation.This week a United Nations working group responded to a joint statement posted online in December by some of the world’s largest conservation organizations calling for 30 percent of the planet to be managed for nature by 2030—and for half the planet to be protected by 2050. But exactly what counts as “protected”—and how countries can reach those goals—is still up for debate. (direct download)Conservationists say these high levels of protection are necessary to safeguard benefits that humans derive from nature—such as the filtration of drinking water and storage of carbon that would otherwise increase global warming. The areas are also needed to prevent massive loss of species.Humans and their domestic animals are squeezing the rest of life on Earth to the margins. Today, only four percent of the world’s mammals, by weight, are wild. The other 96 percent are our livestock and ourselves. Since 1970, populations of wild mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians have, on average, declined by 60 percent.Habitat loss is widely regarded as the top cause of species extinction around the world and these dramatic population declines are a red flag that many species are on thin ice—but the good news is that there is still time to save most species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species lists 872 species as extinct, but a whopping 26,500 species as threatened with extinction. To save those species, their homes and the other species with which they depend must be protected—and quickly.“We’ve got a really tight clock,” says Brian O’Donnell, director of the Wyss Campaign for Nature, based in Durango, CO, who advocates globally for more conservation areas. “Every year we wait, we put more species in peril.”The call is part of a process of setting global environmental targets organized by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Negotiations on the specifics of the target will continue until a meeting in Beijing in October 2020.The targets will replace and go beyond the “Aichi Biodiversity Targets,” which were set in 2011 and are supposed to be reached by 2020. Among them is a goal of protecting 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas.Those goals are still within reach. As of 2018, 14.9 percent of the Earth’s land surface and 7.3 percent of the world’s oceans are formally protected.Signatories of the 30 percent by 2030 call posted this week include BirdLife International, Conservation International, the National Geographic Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Nature Conservancy, and nine other non-governmental organizations. Most see the 2030 target as a stepping stone on the way to an even more ambitious goal: conserving half of the planet by 2050.Calls to protect half the Earth date back to the 1970s, but the concept has gained momentum in recent years thanks to the 2009 founding of the Nature Needs Half movement and the 2016 publication of eminent naturalist E.O. Wilson’s book Half Earth..“There has been a great convergence of thought in terms of people thinking on a bigger scale,” says Jonathan Baillie, executive vice president and chief scientist at the National Geographic Society, based in Washington D.C. “It is very rare to get all the major conservation organizations to agree to one thing.”Supporters say that having an ambitious and clear target may help the crisis of biodiversity loss get the attention it deserves from governments and private institutions. In recent years, concern over climate change has captured more attention.O’Donnell says that at the latest meeting on the Convention on Biodiversity country’s environment ministers were the highest ranking officials attending, and many of those only stayed for part of the meeting. In contrast, meetings of the Paris Climate Accord are attended by presidents and prime ministers. At the same time, the climate talks receive far more media and public attention. But the issue of saving biodiversity “needs to be elevated among global leaders,” O’Donnell says.Some observers are waiting to hear more details before they support the idea.The call to protect 30 percent of the Earth “alarmed” Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, based in Baguio City, Philippines. Tauli-Corpuz was one of the authors of a 2018 report criticizing conservation organizations for kicking indigenous people off their traditional lands to create protected areas, preventing those previously displaced by parks from reclaiming their lands, or aggressively policing their behavior and harming their livelihoods by prohibiting farming or hunting.Conservationists increasingly acknowledge the rights of indigenous people to their lands, and even point to the fact that land controlled by indigenous people is often much better cared for, from a biodiversity perspective, than land controlled by settlers. Although indigenous people make up less than five percent of the global population, they own or manage about 25 percent of the Earth’s land—much of it far more diverse and sustainably managed than the remaining three quarters. And despite the challenges of poverty and insecure land rights, indigenous people and local communities spend around four billion dollars a year on conservation—a significant chunk of the total global spend of about 21 billion.But Tauli-Corpuz, who is indigenous herself, says ideologies change slowly, and for many the full-time presence of people making a living seems incompatible with conservation. “I think they are still trapped in the idea that people should not be intervening in nature,” she says. “I came from a meeting in Nairobi a few days ago, and almost all the speakers were still speaking about this issue.”She has called for a grievance mechanism to be set up, so that indigenous people can formally complain to the United Nations if they are harmed by conservation projects, but this has not yet been done. Restitution of land and resources taken by earlier conservation projects has by and large not happened yet either, she adds. “Calling for an increase without dealing with the issues raised by indigenous people is going to be problematic,” she says.Those behind the 2030 call say that land managed and inhabited by indigenous people and other local communities will count toward the target. “Protecting biodiversity means protecting indigenous rights,” says O’Donnell. “That is going to be at the center of 30 percent for the planet, rather than in conflict with it.”This critically endangered South China tiger lives at the Suzhou Zoo in China. This is a species that may be gone from the wild now. As of 2015 there were only 100 in captivity.Some areas are managed by local people for both conservation and sustainable use. O’Donnell and Baillie both gave the example of the Northern Rangelands Trust, a consortium of conservancies in Kenya in which local pastoralists from 18 different ethnic groups manage their land for both livestock grazing and wild animal conservation, with the financial and logistical support of NGOs and governmental institutions.The project makes clear that not all of the “protected areas” in the 30 percent target will look like the kind of parks and reserves many Americans are familiar with. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has created a typology of categories of protected areas, ranging from Type Ia, “Strict Nature Reserves,” with limited access for people, to Type IV, “Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources”—which more or less describes many places where indigenous people live today.This, coupled with the superior track record of indigenous people in protecting biodiversity, is why Erle Ellis, an environmental scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County says that as far as he is concerned, “enforcement of indigenous sovereignty should be automatically part of that 30 percent.”Beyond the many flavors of “protected area,” the call includes room for “Other Effective Area Based Conservation Measures.” As the capitalization hints, this is not just a vague phrase, but an increasingly codified category of land management, first sketched out in the 2011 Aichi targets. One report defines it as “a geographically defined space, not recognized as a protected area, which is governed and managed over the long-term in ways that deliver the effective in-situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem services and cultural and spiritual values.”Potential examples include traditional hunting and gathering grounds; natural areas on military bases; areas set aside for scientific research; sacred sites and cemeteries; pastures of native grasslands; or even diverse city parks.According to the groups’ vision statement, the 30 percent that is protected won’t just be the part that is cheapest and easiest to protect, but should be fully representative of the diversity of the planet’s ecosystems. Yet that may be difficult to achieve by 2030, says Ellis.“The big question about getting to 30 percent in a little over ten years is whether the speed is going to sacrifice quality,” he says. “It would be a shame if people tried to get there fast by conserving the land that isn’t really under pressure.”Likewise, he says, conserving land without making sure there is long-term funding to manage it and plans to ensure the stability and prosperity of surrounding communities risks creating “paper parks” that are routinely plundered of resources by those who don’t have a stake in the area or are driven by necessity. “By trying to move too past it is possible that they will create a huge realm of failed conservation,” he warns.So the emerging vision is more complex than the “30 percent by 2030” slogan may suggest. By 2030, leading conservationists say, Earth should dedicate 30 percent of its land and sea to a robustly financed, locally supported, ecologically representative mix of areas managed for the benefit of nature.",
"Oriente Region, EcuadorPushed forward by a chugging long-tail motor, an old dugout canoe carries us down the languorous Conambo River, a tributary of the Amazon, at the western edge of Ecuador’s Oriente region. We spend the day on the river, sometimes baking in the sun, other times getting drenched by cloudbursts of rain.Cobalt-winged parakeets flock to a pool to eat clay in Yasuni National Park.We are followed by a screeching pandemonium of scarlet and green-winged macaws, chased by flocks of prattling parakeets, monitored by stealthy guans, and surveyed by the occasional toucan. A harpy eagle swoops above us, looking for its lunch, most likely a woolly or howler monkey that we have heard chattering and whooping in the canopy.Once in a while, our skipper pulls the boat up along a shady bank to snag some barbudo, a foot-long catfish, for dinner. Every time he lands one—the fish’s long barbels wriggling like giant earthworms—he expertly slaps his catch on the side of the boat, snapping off its spiky dorsal and pectoral fins to avoid getting stabbed by its sharp barbs.In the afternoon, we come ashore to explore a large oxbow lake—a meander that got cut off from the main channel of the river. As we examine the birdlike tapir tracks imprinted in the bank, a large freshwater stingray glides past us through the murky waters. Back in the boat, our guide shares a foot-long, thumb-thick guaba seedpod called “ice-cream beans” for the sweet vanilla flavor of the cotton candy-like white pulp surrounding the large black beans. Sucking on the sweet flesh, I watch a giant blue morpho butterfly flicker in and out of the deep jade shadows of the rain forest.We are in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth—the Napo moist tropical forest in northeastern Ecuador, made famous by Yasuni National Park. According to Kelly Swing, the director of the Tiputini Biodiversity Station, there are about 600 species of birds, 200 species of mammals, 500 species of fish, and 150 species of frogs in the park. “One hectare of Yasuni forest may contain up to 600 species of trees and over 100,000 species of insects,” says Swing. “Microbial diversity is overwhelming.”For Ecuador’s indigenous Sápara people, being able to move around their traditional territory is essential to climate change adaptation.Its estimated a million species, most still undiscovered, live in the New Hampshire-sized Yasuni, making it an icon of biodiversity. By way of comparison, only about 1.5 million species inhabiting our planet have been documented by science.But, we are not in Yasuni. We are about 80 miles south of its boundary, on the traditional territory of the Sápara people or, as they call themselves, children of Aritiaku, the red howler monkey. “Both the Yasuni park and Sápara territory are located at the intersection between the Andean uplands and the Amazonian lowlands, and this transitional zone creates an astounding abundance of distinct life-forms,” explains Swing.“The indigenous peoples of the Amazon have proven to be the best guardians of their traditional territories,” Swing adds. “The fact that the Amazon ecosystems are as rich as they are today is proof of how successful these cultures have been, in living in balance with their environment.”About 200 Sápara live in Ecuador, with approximately the same number across the border in Peru. Together, they are all that remain of a once thriving nation that totaled between 20,000 to 30,000 and comprised more than 200 peaceful tribes, who differed in name, but shared a common tongue. Following the Spanish conquest of the 16th century, the Sápara, like other indigenous groups in the region, were decimated by epidemics of measles, smallpox, and yellow fever, among other European “gifts.” At one point considered extinct, the Sápara were officially recognized by the Ecuadorian government in the 1990s. This included setting aside over 320,000 hectares of the Sápara’s sacred Naku, or rain forest—a mere eight percent of their historical range—as the Traditional Sápara Settlement Area. In 2001, UNESCO recognized the endangered Sápara language as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.”An orange tiger butterfly feeds on flower nectar in the rain forest of Ecuador.Such recognition, however, has done little to acknowledge the Sápara’s role in biodiversity conservation and reduce the growing external threats to their ancestral territory, according to Kevin Koeing, climate and energy director of Amazon Watch, an environmental NGO working with indigenous peoples to protect the Amazon. “The government of Ecuador continues to view peoples as an obstacle to economic growth,” says Koeing. “It is pushing for oil development in the region by auctioning off blocks of the Sápara’s Naku that it considers under-populated and under-utilized wilderness that must be tamed. It is time to flip this dominant narrative and acknowledge the role of the Sápara and other indigenous peoples in doing the most critical thing that could be done under the imminent threat of biodiversity loss and climate change—and that is looking after their sacred Naku.”A glow in the sky over Yasuni from oil wells burning off gas. Such development in the highly biodiverse area is very controversial, and often impacts local people as well.The story of the Sápara is not unique. Around the world, indigenous peoples have been displaced from their traditional territories in the name of ecotourism, like the Maasai in Tanzania, as well as conservation, as were the Sengwer and Ogiek peoples in Kenya. Indigenous peoples have had to abandon their livelihoods and ancestral lands because of large-scale development projects, such as Gibe III dam along Ethiopia’s Omo River; and, more recently, they have become climate refugees, like the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe in Louisiana or the Inupiaq whaling community of Kivalina.But as our collective understanding of the imperiled state of our planet grows—the 6th extinction, escalating climate change, and exceeding planetary boundaries—the global discourse and actions are shifting toward a greater acknowledgement of the role of indigenous peoples and local communities and their traditional territories in biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. Recent research demonstrates that while the world’s 370 million indigenous peoples make up less than five percent of the total human population, they manage or hold tenure over 25 percent of the world’s land surface and support about 80 percent of the global biodiversity.This week, world leaders have an opportunity to tackle these issues head on. The Fourteenth Conference of the Parties (COP14) to the Convention on Biodiversity, held between 17-29 November in Egypt, gives leaders a chance to further assert the role of indigenous peoples. Among other issues, COP14 will assess global progress toward achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. In particular, Aichi Target 11 sets expectations for national governments to reach at least 17 percent of terrestrial and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas to be conserved through protected areas and other conservation measures by 2020. And experts say indigenous stewardship may be a critical way to meet those goals.The evolution in thinking about the role of indigenous peoples as stewards of the Earth is the culmination of a number of trends. For one, the increasing sophistication of spatial analytical tools, such as the Global Platform of Indigenous and Community Lands or LandMark, the Protected Planet database, and the Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas Registry, has enabled a better documentation of the extent, as well as biodiversity and carbon storage values, of indigenous lands.Indigenous rights to self-determination, well-being, traditional knowledge, and a healthy environment—as articulated in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples–—have also been increasingly recognized by national governments and the conservation community. Philanthropic and development organizations are also increasingly supporting indigenous conservation projects, in part because they often see them as a win-win to help people and the planet.In Australia and Namibia, countries with legally binding mechanisms to recognize indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ rights in managing natural resources, the contribution of those groups to conservation is considered equivalent to other types of protected areas.Patrick O’Leary, senior officer of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Outback to Oceans Program, applauds the recent decision by the Australian government to extend its support for Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) and the Indigenous Rangers programs through 2023 and 2021, to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to continue managing existing and creating new IPAs. Established in 1997, the IPA Program has contributed significantly to Australia’s efforts to protect and conserve its biodiversity, notes O’Leary. Currently, 75 IPAs cover approximately 68 million hectares, representing over 45 percent of Australia’s National Reserve System. Moreover, Australia’s IPAs provide many cultural, social, health, and economic benefits to local people, says O’Leary.In Namibia, the recognition of community-based natural resource management under the Nature Conservation Amendment Act of 1996 has resulted in the establishment of 82 conservancies and 32 community forests. Today, conservancies cover about 20 percent of the country’s surface area. Some animal populations have been restored, others are recovering, while living conditions for local people continue to improve.In Canada, the recent federal recognition of the Edéhzhíe Protected Area in the country’s northwest and support for the Indigenous Guardianship Program—in which indigenous communities are empowered to manage their territories according to traditional laws—are recent steps towards the acknowledgment of indigenous stewardship. “These important developments advance national biodiversity conservation goals,” says Eli Enns, co-chair of Canada’s Indigenous Circle of Experts. “This builds on the nearly three decades of indigenous-led efforts to assert their constitutionally protected rights to look after their traditional territories, beginning with the recognition of Gwaii Haanas and Tla-o-qui-aht Tribal Parks in the 1980s.”In Europe, this shift has led to the recognition of the Havukkavaara forest in North Karelia in Finland. For Tero Mustonen, director of the advocacy group Snowchange Cooperative, Havukkavaara is an example of “a new style of community-based conservation that includes culture, history, and people to help sustain traditional lifeways and conserve the last vestiges of the old-growth forests south of the Arctic Circle in Finland.”Despite their rising profile, the precise role of indigenous territories in the Convention on Biological Diversity remains unclear—although that could change after the meeting in Egypt this week. In order to help meet the global biodiversity targets, leaders are arguing that qualifying lands under the convention need to be expanded to include “a geographically defined area, other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained outcomes for the in-situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem services and cultural and spiritual values.”In other words, many leaders hope to clarify that the global biodiversity goals be met not only with traditional protected areas like parks—which have conservation as the primary objective of management—but also with areas that show conservation outcomes, rather than objectives. These latter areas would include indigenous-managed territories, such as the Sápara lands in Ecuador.However, experts warn that recognizing the contributions of indigenous peoples is not as simple as drawing polygons on maps. It means going beyond traditional “fortress conservation,” of walling people away from nature. To work, such partnerships need to value holistic indigenous knowledge systems and ways of life.As Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, states in her report “Cornered by Protected Areas,” it means adopting rights-based approaches to conservation that bring justice for indigenous peoples and local communities, while enabling biodiversity conservation and climate action.“The future of our planet lies in indigenous ways of living on the Earth,” says Jon Waterhouse, Indigenous Peoples Scholar at the Oregon Health and Science University and a National Geographic Education Fellow Emeritus and Explorer. “As a global community, we have lost our way; we forgot what it means to have a relationship with the land.”To find it again, we have great guides, says Waterhouse. “Indigenous peoples have mastered the art of living on the Earth without destroying it. They continue to teach and lead by example, from the restoration of eel grass and salmon by the Samish Nation, to the bison reintroduction by the Kainai Nation of the Blackfoot Confederacy, to the restoration of traditional 800-year old Hawaiian fish ponds. We must heed these lessons and take on this challenging task, if we want our grandchildren to have a future.”",
"Children play in the sand along the shore of the Omo River near the village of Karo, home to one of the region’s more endangered indigenous tribes. The group is entirely dependent on the Omo River, and grows sorghum, maize, beans and peas, to round up a diet of fish from the river.The Lower Omo Valley in southwest Ethiopia is home to more than 200,000 people, living in villages along the shores of the mighty Omo River, which meanders for 500 miles through the central highlands and empties into Lake Turkana on the border with Kenya, the world’s largest desert lake.The region is one of Africa’s last frontiers, unconquered by European colonists, where tribal body-painting and coming-of-age scaring rituals today draw tourists in search of the kind of African experience that has disappeared elsewhere on the continent.And it may be vanishing in the Omo as well. Starting in 2008, construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam on the river upended that life for subsistence farmers, cattle herders, and fishermen, who depended on the Omo’s natural flow to sustain their livelihoods. Now they face a severe shortage of food and government-sponsored modernization that is encroaching on their tribal lands.The dam is 800 feet (240 meters) high and is Africa’s tallest, and its hydroelectric power plant has doubled Ethiopia’s electricity production. Opened in October 2015, the dam also slowed the Omo’s flow and ended the twice-yearly flooding that nourished river-bank agricultural land and cattle pastures with deposits of nutrient-rich alluvial sediment—and diminished the region’s resilience to drought. Cattle herders have been forced to migrant elsewhere to find suitable grazing pastures, and local agriculture has fallen on hard times.Drought in the past two rainy seasons has worsened the hardships. The dam also threatens water levels in Lake Turkana, further harming local fishing grounds.Once the dam was complete, the Ethiopian government leased large swaths of tribal lands to foreign companies to build large, irrigated sugar and cotton plantations. Four sugar-processing plants were scheduled to begin production this year. Some tribes are being resettled.The plantations and factories employ few of the Omo villagers. Most of the workers have come from outside the valley.Fausto Podavini, who lives in Rome, photographed the gallery above over five years, between 2011 and 2016.",
"Clad in a camouflage jacket, the mosquito netting unzipped from his hood, Yuri Khudi squats by the fire inside his large chum. Outside, seven more of the teepee-like tents cluster in a semicircle. Swells of Siberian tundra roll north toward the Arctic Ocean; a reindeer herd grazes on a distant crest. It’s mid-July, and the group of Nenets herders that Yuri leads are about halfway through an annual trek that takes them 400 miles north on the Yamal Peninsula to the Arctic coast—in normal years, that is.“It’s been three years since we have made it all the way to our summer pastures by the Kara Sea,” Yuri says as his wife, Katya, pours him a steaming mug of tea. “Our reindeer were too weak for the long journey.” In the winter of 2013-14, an unusual warm spell brought rain to southern Yamal; the deep freeze that followed encased most of the winter pastures in thick ice. The reindeer, used to digging through snow to find lichen, their main winter food, couldn’t dig through the ice. In this herd and others, tens of thousands starved. Now, in the summer of 2016, the survivors are still recovering.The canvas entrance of the chum flaps open, and a reindeer, antlers down, bursts inside. It pauses in front of the fire, shakes vigorously, and flops down to chew its cud meditatively.“This young cow lost her mom, so we raised her ourselves inside the chum,” explains Yuri, taking a cautious sip of tea. “She doesn’t like mosquitoes. Hopefully next year she’ll have a calf of her own. We’re down to about 3,000 reindeer now, half of our usual herd.”The Nenets have undertaken this annual migration for centuries, and at 800 miles round-trip, it’s one of the longest in the world. Yuri’s group, called Brigade 4, is a relic of a Soviet collective—under Soviet rule the Nenets endured decades of forced collectivization and religious persecution. They survived centuries of Russian rule before that. Through it all, they’ve managed to sustain their language, their animist worldview, and their nomadic traditions.“The Nenets are one of the most resilient indigenous groups in the Arctic,” says Bruce Forbes of the University of Lapland in Finland, a geographer who has studied them for decades.Today, however, that resilience is being tested in new ways. Climate scientists say the kind of “rain on snow” event that diminished the herds three years ago will become more frequent and intense in the Arctic as the climate warms. As I talk to Yuri, the region is suffering another record-hot summer; the thermometer has already hit 94°F. It hasn’t rained for weeks, and it’s hard for reindeer to pull the loaded sleighs across the dry tundra. Before the summer is out, a boy and more than 2,300 reindeer will die from anthrax on southern Yamal, and dozens of people will get sick—a direct result of thawing permafrost, which allowed animal carcasses buried during an outbreak in the 1940s to reemerge, still bearing infectious microbes.Yet climate change isn’t even the greatest threat to the Nenets. Development is. Russia’s quest for new sources of hydrocarbons has encroached on pastures that were already tight for the estimated 255,000 reindeer and the 6,000 nomadic herders that live on Yamal. And it has restricted the essential migration of some of the herds. The Bovanenkovo gas field, the largest on Yamal, sits directly in Brigade 4’s path. The herd must cross the field, with its roads and pipelines, to get to the summer pastures.The Nenets have always lived close to the edge; in their language, Yamal means “edge of the world.” But these days at least some of them seem precariously close to falling off.Eighty-year-old Nina Khudi steps outside the family chum. Covered with reindeer skins in the winter, the teepee-like tent protects the family from blowing snow and biting cold.Perched on the left side of the sleigh, his legs firmly planted on a runner, Nyadma Khudi raps the backs of his reindeer with a tyur—a long pole of polished wood ending in an antler knob. Grunting softly, he urges the four bulls forward through shrub willows and clouds of mosquitoes. Nyadma is Yuri’s elder brother and a former brigade chief. As a sign of respect, his caravan of several sleighs is in the lead as Brigade 4 presses on toward Bovanenkovo.After about an hour, Nyadma suddenly stops. “We’ll break here for a bit, to let everybody catch up,” he says, as he fishes a ringing cell phone out of his capacious, bell-shaped reindeer-skin coat. Other sleighs pull up behind us. The harmony of clicking reindeer hooves soon gives way to the cacophony of dial tones and human chatter as the Nenets enjoy one of the few perks of having a mega-development in their backyard: We’re now within range of Bovanenkovo’s cell phone tower.I step away from the sleighs to stretch my legs. The midnight sun fills the lakes and waterways ahead of us with an amber glow. A distant hum, like that of a jet before takeoff, draws my attention; it’s coming from the gas field, still many miles away.Yamal’s natural gas is the cornerstone of Russia’s energy strategy—the new source that will replace declining fields to the south and east of here—and Bovanenkovo is the cornerstone of Yamal. It’s operated by Gazprom, the state-owned company that produces most of Russia’s natural gas and supplies more than a third of the European Union’s imports. According to Alexey Miller, Gazprom’s CEO, Yamal could produce as much as 13 trillion cubic feet of gas a year by 2030—more than a third of Russia’s projected total. Bovanenkovo alone has confirmed reserves of nearly 173 trillion cubic feet. Linked to the mainland by its own airport and a 350-mile railroad, and to Russia’s gas grid by two 750-mile pipelines, Bovanenkovo is also a launchpad for Gazprom’s further expansion into the Russian Arctic.Global warming is the greatest obstacle to that ambitious agenda. Alexey Osokin is deputy director of Gazprom’s engineering center, which has collected and analyzed 25 years of weather and permafrost data from meteorological stations and gas wells around the Yamal Peninsula. “One cannot argue with the data,” he says. “There is no doubt that the climate is warming.” In summer, thawing permafrost undermines the stability of Gazprom structures. The company has had to install refrigeration units to keep the ground frozen around wellheads and pipelines.Some effects of thawing permafrost are hard to prepare for, Osokin says. In the summer of 2014 a gaping crater, 130 feet wide by 115 feet deep, suddenly formed in the tundra 19 miles southeast of Bovanenkovo. Experts blame an eruption of methane gas that had been trapped under frozen ground. They worry that if a similar eruption were to occur under the gas field itself, it could cause considerable damage. In the summer of 2017 two more eruptions were reported on the peninsula. One occurred near the camp of a herder.Brigade 4 has a deadline: a day and an hour when, by appointment with Gazprom, it is to cross the busiest road through Bovanenkovo. After two days of picking our way through an industrial maze, we finally reach the crossing place. On the concrete road, large trucks roll by every minute. Crossing is treacherous for both reindeer and herders.“This is why we coordinate the road crossings with Gazprom,” says Galina Mataras, director of a nongovernmental organization that represents the Nenets herders. “It’s taken a lot of time and effort to make sure that the crossing is expedient and safe.” At the appointed hour, traffic is stopped and a large swath of white geotextile fabric is unrolled across the road. The fabric eases the movement of sleighs across the concrete slabs.For Gazprom the “white carpet” affair is an annual photo opportunity. A helicopter has flown in from Salekhard to deliver representatives of the company, the herders’ own business enterprise, a couple of NGOs, the regional government, and the local press. As the reindeer caravan begins the crossing, Gazprom and the press document the event. Workers in crisp blue coveralls, with a silver Gazprom logo branded on their backs, line up on both sides of the white carpet to take pictures and get selfies with the herd.“That’s it!” announces Nyadma, after we’ve crossed the road at last. “No more roads or pipelines. We don’t have to rush and break camp every night now. We can take our time fishing.“It wasn’t easy, when Gazprom arrived,” he goes on. In the early years at Bovanenkovo, after construction began in the 1980s, rail lines, pipelines, roads, sandpits, and buildings were popping up everywhere. “We felt trapped, like there was no place for us on our ancestral land,” Nyadma says. “We understand that the country needs natural gas, and once the main construction stopped, we figured a way around this mess. We can cope with it.” He pauses. “As long as they don’t build any more roads or pipelines.”An hour later we stop on a high knoll, and Nyadma peers through his field glasses, scouting the pass ahead. His sons Gosha and Ilya pull up in their sleighs. Now everybody is looking in the same direction through their binoculars, talking agitatedly in Nenets. In the distance a new dirt road scars the tundra.Later we discover a new feeder line parallel to the road; connecting a gas well to a compressor, it cut across our next campsite. Neither the road nor the pipe were here three summers ago, when the brigade last passed through. The Nenets hadn’t been alerted to their construction. They shouldn’t be there, Nyadma says.At the campsite, between the road and the pipeline, I discover the source of the distant hum I heard a few days ago. Just a few hundred yards away now, it’s a crimson ball of fire belching out of a sooty pipe—a gas flare that serves to release excess pressure from the pipeline. In the swirling air around the flames, tundra, water, and sky melt into a mirage of browns, greens, and blues. The hum has become a powerful roar that drowns out most other sounds.And from this vantage point, the notion that the Nenets reindeer herders can coexist in a “balanced” way with oil and gas development—an idea I heard consistently from Gazprom officials, the regional government, NGOs, and the herders themselves—seems an illusion. A new gas processing facility, with its associated roads and pipelines, is scheduled to come on line at Bovanenkovo in the next couple of years. Two new railroad branches are being constructed to connect hubs at Bovanenkovo and Payuta in western Yamal with oil and gas terminals on the east coast. Those railway lines will cut across the migration routes of most of the Nenets herds. Even more troubling for Brigade 4, a new gas field called Kruzenshternskoye is projected to come on line in the early 2020s on the Kara Sea coast. It will encroach on exceptionally rich pastures.As I’m pondering all this, the roaring gas flare abruptly shuts off. The thermals dissipate around the pipe, and the landscape beyond settles back into its familiar shapes and colors. Around me, the next generation of Nenets herders are practicing their lassoing skills on sleighs, dogs, and each other, while the next generation of Nenets mothers feed their dolls in makeshift toy chums. In the silence, the familiar sounds return—the low voices of the herders, the cries of the children and dogs, the clicks of the reindeer hooves. For a moment, everything seems all right again on the edge of the world.",
"A full moon, captured in 2005 by a crew member of the International Space Station, appears to be rolling along atop Earth's deep-blue stratosphere.With volcanoes, frozen oceans, and methane seas, moons are often much more than balls of rock circling a body other than the sun. In fact, the only definitive thing that separates many moons from planets like the Earth and Mars is what they revolve around. Planets circle the sun; moons circle the things that circle the sun—planets, dwarf planets, and other so-called small solar system bodies. Otherwise, moons are diverse and fascinating worlds unto their own.One of four planet-size moons in orbit around the planet Jupiter, Europa has an almost glassy surface of ice that scientists say may cover an ocean that is 31 miles (50 kilometers) deep. Tidal forces between Jupiter and Europa are believed to generate enough heat to keep the ocean liquid. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope also indicate Europa has a tenuous atmosphere of oxygen. The combination of water, a heat source, and an atmosphere raises the possibility that Europa harbors life.The best known moon is the one in orbit around planet Earth. It is Earth's only natural satellite and the only extraterrestrial body that humans have visited. Gravity on the moon is one-sixth of Earth's gravity, allowing astronauts to take giant leaps on its surface. The moon lacks an atmosphere, but spacecraft have found water ice at both poles, deposited from impacting comets.According to a leading theory, a Mars-size body smacked Earth about 4.5 billion years ago and the debris from the collision accumulated to form its moon. But unlike Earth's moon, many moons formed from the same material that glommed together and gave rise to the body they orbit. Other moons are asteroids captured into orbit by a larger body's gravity. Only the dwarf planet Pluto's moon Charon is thought to have formed from a collision like the one that gave rise to Earth's moon.No matter how they form, the moons are many. Only Mercury and Venus are moonless. Earth has one, Mars two. Neptune has 13 and Uranus 27. The gas giant Jupiter has 63 known moons. Saturn has at least 60—and 42 of those have been discovered since 1997. The dwarf planet Pluto has three moons. Eris, another dwarf planet, has one moon. Dozens more moons orbit small solar system bodies.",
"Scientists may have just found the oldest intact Earth rock—on the moon. A study published Thursday in Earth and Planetary Science Letters makes the case that one of the rocks collected by Apollo 14 astronauts in 1971 contains a fragment of Earth's ancient crust, dating back more than 4.011 billion years.It's possible that the fragment formed in a weirdly water-rich pocket of magma deep within the ancient moon. But the study authors think it's likelier that the rock formed within our planet's crust and got jettisoned to the moon by one of the many meteor impacts that bombarded early Earth.If so, the fragment is one of the oldest Earth rocks ever found. The oldest minerals found on Earth come from Australia's Jack Hills and are up to 4.4 billion years old. But those dates have been disputed, and even if the minerals really are that old, they're debris left over from rocks that disintegrated long ago. By contrast, the Apollo 14 fragment is much more fully preserved.“It is technically a 'rock,' whereas the Jack Hills [minerals] are individual, contextless crystals,” lead study author Jeremy Bellucci, a researcher at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, writes in an email.The finding adds to the Apollo missions' decades-long scientific legacy, and it further cements the moon as the solar system's premier archivist. Since the moon is so ancient, airless, and geologically inactive, its surface records the history of impacts in the early solar system—most likely including impact debris sent there from other worlds. It's thought that up to 0.5 percent of the schmutz on the lunar surface first formed on Earth, and bits and pieces of other rocky planets, such as Venus or Mars, probably litter the moon, too.But the Apollo 14 rock, if confirmed to have earthly origins, would be the first of its kind plucked from the moon and in scientific hands.“If that’s true, then this is quite a fascinating finding,” says Cornelia Rasmussen, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the chemistry of Earth's impact craters. “We don't really have a rock record of this time on Earth, which means [the find] gives us a window to a time we can't really study here.”Collected by Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard on February 6, 1971, the rock bearing the suspected piece of Earth—formally named 14321—is one of the largest that the Apollo missions brought back from the moon.Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard took this photograph of the rock known as 14321 minutes before he collected it from the lunar surface.The basketball-size stone weighs almost 20 pounds. It's a type of rock called a breccia, sort of a stony collage pieced together from bits of many different, older rocks. The impact that made Imbrium crater, one of the huge dark splotches on the moon's near side, likely forged this larger rock and flung it to the Apollo 14 landing site.Most of its components, called clasts, are dark in color. But one piece stands out as oddly bright, with a makeup similar to the granites you might find on Earth. To find out where did this outlier bit of 14321 came from, Bellucci's team re-sampled the rock and focused on minerals within it called zircons.“Zircon is an incredibly hardy, robust, sturdy mineral,” says study coauthor David Kring, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute. “So if you are looking for a relic of the most ancient geologic processes, zircon's a very good mineral to begin with.”When the team analyzed these zircons and the surrounding quartz, they found that the oddball clast formed in conditions that would've been really weird on the moon at the time. For one, the zircons formed in far colder, oxygen-rich magmas than the moon typically has.In addition, the clast seems to have formed at pressures you'd only find on the moon more than a hundred miles below its surface. But the impact that geologists think formed 14321 probably dug no more than 45 miles into the lunar ground. If the clast formed so deep, how did it get up to the surface?An arrow marks the light-colored portion, or felsite clast, of 14321 that researchers think formed on Earth.The researchers soon realized that the clast's head-scratching properties make perfect sense if it instead formed on Earth. About 12 miles beneath Earth's surface, magmas experience temperature, pressure, and oxygen levels just like the ones that formed the mystery clast. When Bellucci made a chart that compared Earth's zircons against the lunar ones, the similarities became clear.“It was dead in the middle of the terrestrial field, and then I was like, Whoa ... that's awesome!” Bellucci says. “From there, it snowballed.”Future research on the samples could firm up Bellucci's interpretation. It's also possible that other moon rocks currently in humanity's collection contain flecks of ancient Earth.“I'm sure we'll find additional samples, and I have a sneaky suspicion that this is going to prompt a lot of other people in the community to do likewise,” Kring says.Fresh samples from the moon also would help—and may be coming soon. For instance, China's upcoming Chang'e-5 lunar mission is expected to return samples. But for now, work on the Apollo material is grounded. Though U.S. lawmakers have reportedly reached a deal to fund the U.S. government temporarily, the ongoing shutdown has derailed many scientists' lives—including those of the study authors.As of Thursday evening, Kring says, “my institute is going to be shutting down at the end of tomorrow. We’re not going to be able to do the exciting science that this discovery illustrates.”",
"An illustration shows what Earth may have looked like 3.8 to 4 billion yerars ago, during a theorized rain of space rocks called the Late Heavy Bombardment.Ever since the sun was born around 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system has been a violent place. Like a pinball machine filled to the brim, our cosmic neighborhood was once packed with meteors, comets, and even baby planets crashing into each other, leaving scars in the form of impact craters.Today, we know that space rocks of all shapes and sizes continue their jostling dance. But it’s not clear how the number of impacts has actually changed over time.Now, researchers using data from a NASA moon probe report something startling in the journal Science: 290 million years ago, the rate of impacts on the moon—and thus, Earth—increased dramatically, and that onslaught has possibly not yet died down.This matters, not least because asteroids large enough to make it through the atmosphere can smash into Earth and trigger mass extinctions. One such impact proved to be the coup de grâce for the age of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office keeps watch for any potentially hazardous Earthbound space debris, and it certainly helps their efforts to know what the inner solar system’s impact rates are like. The more of the picture we can uncover, the better we’ll be able to understand what puts our survival at risk.Inconveniently for impact analysts, Earth has active plate tectonics, weathering, and erosion, and these processes smooth over our planet’s record of ancient craters. That means our impact record is heavily biased toward recent events.But the moon is an airless body lacking erosional capabilities and plate tectonics, making it a comparatively untouched geological archive. And since it’s been a constant companion to Earth for most of its lifetime, the moon can be used to fill in the gaps in the planet’s impact history.In effect, the moon is “a time capsule for events that happen in our corner of the solar system. It’s so cool to have all that data,” says study leader Sara Mazrouei, a planetary scientist at the University of Toronto.Accessing that data isn’t always easy, though. For astronomers who can’t make a lunar field trip, they need other methods for determining the ages of craters. So, Mazrouei and her team found a way to map and date the moon’s craters from a billion years ago to the present using NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).To start, the team knew that large craters formed in the past billion years are covered in plenty of rocky debris, but older pits aren’t. That’s because over millions of years, larger rocks are broken apart by micrometeorite impacts, small gaseous outbursts at the surface, and the switching between extremely hot and cold temperatures during the lunar day and night cycle.This gradual change from rocks to lunar dust affects how heat escapes from the craters and their surroundings. Study coauthor Rebecca Ghent, an associate professor of planetary sciences at the University of Toronto, took advantage of this fact.She looked to LRO’s thermal radiometer, named Diviner, which measures the heat being emitted from the moon’s surface. Using already dated craters, she found a “beautiful correlation” between rock cover, their ability to transmit heat, and a crater’s age.With Diviner now able to date craters larger than 6.2 miles across, Mazrouei set to work. Mapping a billion years’ worth of craters on the moon by hand over the next five years, she quips that she had to check her sanity a few times. However, when she showed her preliminary results to Bill Bottke, a planetary scientist and asteroid expert at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, she knew she was onto something.“Some people are sitting on a pot of gold and don’t realize it,” Bottke, another of the study’s coauthors, told her. “And you are sitting on a pot of gold.”Together, the team found that two to three times as many objects have been slamming into the moon starting 290 million years ago, compared to the impact rates in the 710 million years prior.The scientists strongly suspected that the same shift in impact rate must apply to Earth, but they knew finding evidence for it would be tricky. That’s when study coauthor Thomas Gernon, an associate professor of Earth science at the University of Southampton, mentioned kimberlites. Suddenly, everything fell into place.Kimberlites are volcanic, carrot-shaped pipes normally found in the hearts of extremely stable, very ancient continental landmasses. These pipes once launched diamonds up from hellish depths into the shallow crust; nowadays, they are well-mapped and mined for their riches.“Continents are like pincushions pierced by thousands of kimberlites. They are archives of ancient erosion,” Gernon explains. Before 650 million years ago, a colossal series of planetwide glaciations known as Snowball Earth shaved off up to a third of Earth’s crust, including these kimberlites. For now, impact records earlier than that date are largely lost to time.From 650 million years onward, however, it’s clear that they have experienced very little erosion. This means they contain an unbiased cratering record, and it shows that the lunar impact spike 290 million years ago also appears on Earth.Its green surroundings showcase a ruby from Tanzania in its unpolished beauty. Rubies, valued as precious gems, are the mineral corundum in its red form. Perhaps the country best known for its rubies was Myanmar (Burma), but the country's production has greatly decreased. Today rubies are also created synthetically in the lab.The simplest model suggests that “the impact rate increased 290 million years ago and stayed high over that time,” Bottke says. “That, we can say with confidence.”This match between the terrestrial and lunar records “makes a very strong argument for this finding being real,” says Paul Byrne, an assistant professor of planetary geology at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the study.The planet Mercury might help out, too. When the European Space Agency’s BepiColombo spacecraft arrives there in 2025, it’ll be able to use similar instrumentation as LRO’s to map and date the craters on this similarly airless, erosion-free world.“We might be able to see if there’s a similar signature on Mercury, too,” Mazrouei says. “That would be super awesome.”The question, of course, is why is there a spike at all? According to Bottke, almost all the impacts we have on Earth came from objects that escaped the asteroid belt. A large body broke up, perhaps through a collisional event, creating many fragments.Over time, these fragments would be bombarded by sunlight. Per a trick of physics called the Yarkovsky effect, the radiation that’s absorbed then re-emitted gives the debris a tiny bit of a nudge. For smaller asteroids, this can move them in reach of the gravitational tendrils of planets, potentially putting them on a collision path.“It’s sort of like a rising tide,” Bottke explains. “You’ll get a lot of material coming out of the asteroid belt, and eventually you’ll get a peak in the asteroid impact flux on Earth, which will gradually go down over time.”It’s possible that multiple break-ups in the asteroid belt contributed to the overall spike, or it may be due to one really catastrophic event. This is something future modelling work will hopefully nail down.Whatever the cause, this impact flux spike will no doubt continue to intrigue scientists hoping to not only understand Earth’s past, but also to avoid the fate of the dinosaurs.",
"A full moon seems to brush Earth's atmosphere as seen from the International Space Station.The moon is often thought of as a lifeless and inactive place. But a new study reminds us that our pale celestial guardian is more dynamic than it seems from afar. Fresh measurements of its flimsy atmosphere back up the idea that our lunar companion is surrounded by an electric shell, and that shell seems to gather power when Earth shields it from the fury of the sun during a full moon.In effect, when you gaze at a bright full moon shining in the sky, you are probably seeing the lunar orb at its most electric.Worlds with atmospheres tend to have outer layers known as ionospheres. Material that reaches these extraordinary heights bumps up against the vacuum of space, where starlight and cosmic rays attack it, stripping electrons from atoms and creating a thinly spread shell of electrically charged gas, or plasma. (Find out about the water reserves deep inside the moon.)Despite its extremely low gravitational field, the moon has an incredibly thin type of atmosphere known as an exosphere. It’s fuelled by tiny gaseous pulses at the surface powered by radioactive decay, atoms blasted upward by micrometeorite impacts and solar wind, and even lunar dust that’s potentially levitated by electrostatic forces.Back in the 1970s, Soviet Luna probes 19 and 22 circled the moon and brushed up ever so gently against a layer of charged particles high above the silent terrain. It appeared that, much like on Earth, the moon’s fantastically diffuse exosphere was interacting with starlight and giving rise to an ionosphere. It’s ephemeral, but it’s there. (The race back to the moon may be putting historic artifacts at risk.)“There’s a lot we don’t know about it, and it’s fair to say there’s still some controversy,” says Jasper Halekas, lead author of the new study in Geophysical Research Letters and an associate professor of experimental space physics at the University of Iowa.Part of the problem is that the moon’s ionosphere is so weak that it’s barely detectible when it’s smothered by plasma streaming off the sun and Earth. This renders many of its characteristics concealed behind a violent fog, triggering plenty of debate.Hoping to shed some light on the enigma, Halekas and his team turned to two probes drifting in the darkness. They belong to NASA’s Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun—or ARTEMIS—mission.As the name suggests, these probes, placed in unusual orbits near the moon, are helping us understand how the lunar orb is influenced by the sun. The spacecrafts’ instruments can, among other things, peer into the moon’s highly diffuse exosphere. (Here’s how SpaceX plans to send a private tourist to the moon in 2023.)But to get the best look at it, the team waited for a very specific time: during a full moon.A supermoon is popularly defined as a new or full moon that coincides with the lunar orb making an especially close approach to Earth. This supermoon was just 221,824 miles away.At this point, the moon is behind Earth with respect to the sun, and it finds its way into a sort of pocket within the elongated tail of Earth’s magnetic field. This means the moon and the faint husk of the lunar ionosphere are shielded from much of the highly energetic solar wind that constantly streams into deep space.During this critical window, ARTEMIS could track the plasma waves emerging from the sunlight-bombarded lunar dayside and create a much more detailed picture of the moon’s ionosphere. This was the first time such an incredibly precise technique has been used on the moon, and it revealed that the lunar ionosphere is about a million times more tenuous than Earth’s.Weak though it may be, the lunar-derived plasma has appreciably higher density while in this refuge than the density of the plasma surrounding it. This suggests that the moon’s ionosphere becomes more prominent when it’s in Earth’s protection. (Data from a Japanese probe suggests that the lunar surface also becomes more electric during a full moon.)Halekas describes this relative ionospheric peak as “a little source of plasma bubbling and seething around the moon.”Crucially, this means that the lunar plasma can measurably perturb the plasma coming from Earth and the sun, leading to observable changes in electrical currents and the distribution of electrons around the region. It’s possible that there’s even a plasma-based connection between Earth and the moon, and previous research offers some tentative evidence that such a particle exchange exists.But a moon-Earth plasma pathway and what it could mean for both celestial spheres are highly speculative notions for now. Until better space-based instrumentation takes flight, questions shall remain.It’s also hard to say at this stage whether the moon is a preview for other rocky bodies across the cosmos. Asteroids and other moons in our solar system tend to be smaller than “our magnificent moon,” says Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the U.K.’s Natural History Museum in London. This means they would retain even thinner exospheres.In addition, bodies further from the sun would bathe in less starlight compared to our moon, meaning their exospheres wouldn’t ionize as efficiently. Both factors suggest that if these rocky objects do possess ionospheres, they would probably be even weaker than our lunar companion’s electrified veil.Still, Halekas says, the strange lunar ionosphere is fascinating and “a reason not to think of the moon as a big, dead, dull rock in the sky.”",
"At the abandoned campsite, occupied for less than a day, the visitors left much behind: a section of the ship that carried them on this first-of-its-kind voyage and sophisticated tools for measuring seismic rumblings, solar wind, and the precise distance between this spot and home. There are simpler things as well—scoops and scales, canisters and brackets, two pairs of boots. The expendable trash of a successful mission, too heavy to carry home, lies exactly where it was tossed.On the Earth-facing side of the moon 48 years later, undisturbed by wind or water, development or war, Tranquility Base is still tranquil.“It’s like an archaeologist’s dream,” says Beth O’Leary, of New Mexico State University, one of several preservationists who consider this pristine time capsule as deserving of protection as any archaeological site on Earth.The Google Lunar XPrize has offered a four-million-dollar bonus for close-up footage of an Apollo landing site. O’Leary and her colleagues worry that it may entice private companies to land, roll, or hop their robots dangerously close to objects of immeasurable value to posterity.Charles Duke never reached what Apollo 16 dubbed Dot Crater, for his wife, Dorothy, or Cat Crater, an acronym for sons Charles and Tom, but he did leave behind a backyard portrait. Decades of exposure have likely faded the image, but perhaps the signatures on the reverse are still legible, along with the inscription that identifies the group as the family of astronaut Duke from planet Earth.Lisa Westwood, of California State University, Chico, has troubling visions of entrepreneurs learning to navigate lunar drones from almost a quarter million miles away. “If we have a chance to preserve those sites before the damage occurs, we have the obligation to do so.”Westwood, O’Leary, and others, including Milford Wayne Donaldson, now chairman of the federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, have had some success. California and New Mexico have granted historic recognition to the 106 artifacts at the first landing site.The state actions were envisioned as a stepping-stone to the UNESCO World Heritage List, with national recognition as the next logical move. The listings explicitly cover the artifacts, not the territory—or the footprints, which are just moondust clumped around boot-shaped holes. But follow-up attempts to secure National Historic Landmark status have been rebuffed by federal officials, wary that the designation might be interpreted as a claim on the moon itself. The UN’s Outer Space Treaty, which has governed exploration and use of the moon since 1967, forbids any country from claiming sovereignty over it.Space law does recognize NASA as owner of the Apollo mission materials, and in 2011 NASA cited this legal rationale in its Recommendations to Space-Faring Entities—advice on how to visit the moon without damaging what the Apollo missions left behind.Both the XPrize organizers and the teams have expressed support for the safeguards, but mission plans haven’t been finalized, and preservationists also worry about companies that will follow should a moon industry take root.O’Leary, who was invited by NASA to help develop the recommendations, wants stronger protections, and she pushed for a longer view. “They’re really not in the history business,” she says of NASA, but she’s particularly pleased with one aspect of the guidelines. “Instead of calling it equipment or junk,” she notes, “they called them artifacts.” In fact, NASA terms them “irreplaceable historic, scientific and educational artifacts.”They may not, however, be priceless. Anything associated with the first space race can command a tidy sum at auction, with a premium for objects that have flown in space and a giant boost for anything—even a tiny metal pin—that has come back from the moon.Protection, if it comes at all, will likely require sponsorship from multiple nations, including the growing number of countries whose probes have left their own physical traces on the moon.Russia has claim to the Soviet Union’s Luna 2, launched in 1959, which was the first object sent to the moon. It carried two metallic balls meant to explode on impact and scatter tiny hammer-and-sickle-bedecked pennants across the surface.The Soviets later deployed two remote-controlled Lunokhod rovers. In 1993 they sold Lunokhod 2 for $68,500 at a Sotheby’s auction to video game developer Richard Garriott, who considered it a bargain. Garriott is now the only private owner of an object sitting on the moon.Pointing out that the Outer Space Treaty precludes territorial claims by nations only, not individuals, Garriott argues that he may have a private claim on at least the ground underneath the rover, if not the entire 24-mile track that it traversed. He has invited any XPrize team to visit Lunokhod 2 and secure the smaller one-million-dollar prize for visiting a non-Apollo heritage site. He reasons that if he pays the team for photos and the team pays him for the privilege of crossing the land near his rover, this economic exchange could bolster his chances to prevail with a legal claim on the real estate.As for the prospect of an XPrize rover putting a little dent in his rover or in a piece of Apollo hardware, Garriott says, without malice, “Who cares? That’s part of the new story.”",
"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in February 2018.In recent weeks, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been making headlines for flirting with libel lawsuits, getting his car company Tesla investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a tweet, and smoking weed on-air. Now, the provocative tech titan has unveiled the latest endeavor related to his company’s adventures in rocketry.In a Monday press conference at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, Musk announced that Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has purchased the first ticket to lunar orbit aboard the company’s giant rocket, affectionately known as the BFR. The ticket price is undisclosed, but Musk says it would cover a "material percentage" of the estimated $5 billion necessary to build and develop the rocket.Maezawa is a musician, fashion designer, entrepreneur, and art collector who believes that art has the power to bring world peace. That’s why, in a twist, he won’t be going to the moon alone: Maezawa plans to invite between six and eight artists to accompany him on the week-long journey, which SpaceX is tentatively scheduling for 2023.“I want to share these experiences and things with as many people as possible. That is why I choose to go to the moon with artists!” Maezawa says. “There are so many artists with us today that I wish would create amazing works of art for humankind, for children of the next generation. And I wish very much that such artists could go to space, see the moon up close, and the Earth in full view, and create works that reflect their experience.”He cited Beethoven's piano composition Moonlight Sonata, Van Gogh’s painting “Starry Night,” and The Beatle’s tune “Mr. Moonlight” as examples of transcendent art inspired by the moon. He then shared a short animation describing the art project, called Dear Moon, set to Debussy's “Clair de Lune.”It's all a rather wonderful nod to Carl Sagan's novel Contact, in which astronomer Ellie Arroway, upon first experiencing the indescribable beauty of deep space, whispers: "They should have sent a poet."But wait: What’s the BFR? And why do parts of this plan sound so familiar? We’ve got you covered.Like so many items in Musk’s inventory, this rocket has earned itself a somewhat loaded name. The company is going with the mundane Big Falcon Rocket, based on the name of the existing Falcon rockets in the SpaceX fleet—but the exact meaning of the “F” has been negotiable for a while.Whatever you call it, Musk originally envisioned the BFR as the primary transport vehicle for Mars-bound Earthlings. With a first-stage booster that’s roughly 200 feet tall, 30 feet across, and with dozens of Raptor engines beneath it, the BFR would be legitimately quite large. It could send 150 tons into Earth’s orbit and thrust its partner spaceships (capable of carrying a hundred people) toward the smaller, redder planet next door.In other words, it should be more than capable of reaching the moon, or cleaning up space junk, or ferrying people from one side of the planet to the other in about 30 minutes, all of which Musk says he’d like to do.They did. In February 2017, the company said that an anonymous pair of space travelers had purchased tickets to the moon, on a flight that would see them loop around our natural satellite and then return home. It was supposed to happen in 2018, take about a week, and use the company’s Falcon Heavy rocket and Dragon crew capsule. At the time, the Falcon Heavy had yet to fly, although SpaceX has done a successful test launch since then.Nope. Musk later announced that the trip has been delayed pending production of the BFR—and said that as of now, there are no plans to certify the Falcon Heavy for human spaceflight. Meanwhile, the Dragon crew capsule is still being tested, and NASA is projecting a test flight with the first commercial crew in early 2019.After three failed launches, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk scraped together enough funding to launch a fourth version of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket. On September 28, 2008, Musk's gamble paid off when the Falcon 1 became the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to orbit Earth. The rocket is seen here lifting off from the Reagan Test Site in the Marshall Islands.Well, when that first trip was announced, SpaceX kept the identity of the two travelers secret. This time, they have revealed who the passenger is and why that person wants to visit the moon. Aside from that, it’s still a flight around the moon using a rocket that doesn’t yet exist. And in place of the Dragon, the private passenger will be riding aboard the still-in-development Big Falcon Spaceship.SpaceX is projecting the trip will happen sometime in 2023. But given how long it takes them to design, build, test, and fly its rockets and crew capsules, we wouldn’t put our money on it happening any time soon. And for now, Musk and Maezawa are declining to say which artists may be under consideration for joining the billionaire on his journey. The world will have to wait for more details when SpaceX is ready to deliver them.",
"Ice meets rock in the Antarctic Peninsula, in a picture taken by NASA's Operation IceBridge in October 2017. Millions of years ago, the entire planet may have resembled this polar scene during a phase called Snowball Earth.The Grand Canyon is a gigantic geological library, with rocky layers that tell much of the story of Earth’s history. Curiously though, a sizeable layer representing anywhere from 250 million years to 1.2 billion years is missing.Known as the Great Unconformity, this massive temporal gap can be found not just in this famous crevasse, but in places all over the world. In one layer, you have the Cambrian period, which started roughly 540 million years ago and left behind sedimentary rocks packed with the fossils of complex, multicellular life. Directly below, you have fossil-free crystalline basement rock, which formed about a billion or more years ago.So where did all the rock that belongs in between these time periods go? Using multiple lines of evidence, an international team of geoscientists reckons that the thief was Snowball Earth, a hypothesized time when much, if not all, of the planet was covered in ice.According to the team, at intervals within those billion or so years, up to a third of Earth’s crust was sawn off by Snowball Earth’s roaming glaciers and their erosive capabilities. The resulting sediment was dumped into the slush-covered oceans, where it was then sucked into the mantle by subducting tectonic plates. (Here’s what will happen when Earth’s tectonic plates grind to a halt.)Effectively, in many locations, Earth buried the evidence of about a fifth of its geological history, the team argues today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The notion is elegant but provocative, and the authors themselves predict that some geoscientists will express skepticism.“I think, though, we have extraordinary evidence to support that extraordinary claim,” says study leader C. Brenhin Keller, a postdoctoral fellow at the Berkeley Geochronology Center.Although its nuances, triggers, and shutdown mechanisms continue to be debated, the idea that Earth was a giant frigid “snowball” around 700 million years ago is being increasingly accepted by the scientific community. And similar to what we see in Antarctica today, many of Snowball Earth’s glaciers would have been powerful agents of erosion: The overlying pressure of the ice creates wet bases that can move sediment, despite the extremely low temperatures at the surface.Cambrian sandstone rests on much older basement rock called Vishnu schist in a section of Blacktail Canyon in Arizona that shows the Great Unconformity.The Great Unconformity has in turn often been suggested as being an erosional feature, but some geologists balked at the idea of such a massive amount of Earth’s crust being so thoroughly wiped away.Keller, however, found fresh clues hiding in ancient zircons. These resilient minerals lock in the geochemical conditions of their environment when they crystallize, and scientists can pick them apart billions of years later to find out what Earth was once like. (For instance, four-billion-year-old zircons are offering some clues to the origins of life.)In particular, these zircons contain various radioactive isotopes that act as record-keepers. Uranium isotopes allow researchers to find out the crystals’ formation ages with remarkable precision. Others, like hafnium isotopes, reveal what was happening to the crust and mantle, as certain isotopes prefer one geological setting to another.Using a cornucopia of zircons, Keller and his team carefully unspooled the geochemical evolution of Earth’s crust across 4.4 billion years of time. They saw that a colossal geochemical shift took place at the theorized beginning of Snowball Earth’s planetwide glaciations, which is only explicable if plenty of Earth’s crust was being recycled into new magma reservoirs.Oxygen isotopes within these zircons indicated that the crust had gone through low-temperature hydrothermal changes, too. This meant that it was the top of the crust—in contact with water and ice—that was being shaved off and subducted, not the deeper stuff.Altogether, this evidence suggests that a gargantuan erosional event happened at the surface. Although this erosion didn’t apply evenly across the world, it amounts to an average sediment layer 1.9 to 3.1 miles deep being swept away.The geochemical evidence is powerful, but chance discussions at a recent scientific conference made each future coauthor realize that there’s even more to the story.For one thing, “around 600 to 700 million years ago, Earth loses its craters,” notes study coauthor Bill Bottke, a planetary scientist and asteroid expert at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Some ancient craters still exist on stable continental cores named cratons, but they are few and far between. (Recently, a city-size impact crater was found under the ice in Greenland.)The easy explanation for this mystery was also a ginormous erosional event, but until now, evidence for one was hard to come by. Unlike many other worlds, “Earth does a really good job at erasing the tracks of its past,” Bottke says. Fortunately, Keller’s geochemistry made it clear that Snowball Earth provides a natural explanation.Then there’s the huge uptick in sedimentation rates at the start of the Cambrian. All the new sediment required plenty of space to fall into, something that would have only been possible if massive levels of erosion took place beforehand, says coauthor Thomas Gernon, an associate professor of earth science at the University of Southampton.As the researchers point out, one problem with their data is that there is still a multimillion-year time gap between the predicted end of Snowball Earth and the start of the Cambrian. It’s not clear why the formation of new rock layers took so long to start after all that erosion stopped.Although it’s likely down to a number of factors, one possibility is that Snowball Earth’s erosion was so significant that there wasn’t much topography left to erode when all was said and done. The planet simply needed to forge more land first, and that takes time.Understandably, not everything matches up perfectly, but the study’s narrative is “very plausible,” and its arguments are “pretty clever,” says Ian Fairchild, an emeritus professor of geosciences at the University of Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the research.Bottke hopes the team is right, but either way, he’s happy that this paper will add to the debate over a prolific geological mystery.With an elaborate facade towering more than 150 feet above the desert, Petra's mountaintop "Monastery" was most likely a temple built in the first century B.C.“That conversation is what helps drive the science,” he says.If validated, the implications of this story could be enormously significant. After all, this study points out that complex life first emerged when Snowball Earth’s monstrous mealtime came to an end. Glaciers would have carved out fjord-like shallow marine areas, which could have been havens for life as the planet warmed back up. This colossal crustal consumption may have also coincided with major geochemical and environmental changes that were potentially beneficial to biological evolution.In essence, there’s a chance that the diversification of multicellular animals is a direct consequence of ancient glaciers obliterating the planet’s crust.",
"Fossil of a Cambrian "sea monster."The Cambrian period, part of the Paleozoic era, produced the most intense burst of evolution ever known. The Cambrian Explosion saw an incredible diversity of life emerge, including many major animal groups alive today. Among them were the chordates, to which vertebrates (animals with backbones) such as humans belong.What sparked this biological bonanza isn't clear. It may be that oxygen in the atmosphere, thanks to emissions from photosynthesizing cyanobacteria and algae, were at levels needed to fuel the growth of more complex body structures and ways of living. The environment also became more hospitable, with a warming climate and rising sea levels flooding low-lying landmasses to create shallow, marine habitats ideal for spawning new life-forms.Nevertheless, the scale of the Cambrian Explosion is likely exaggerated due to the proliferation of hard-bodied animals that fossilized much more readily than their soft-bodied precursors. These included brachiopods, which lived in shells resembling those of clams or cockles, and animals with jointed, external skeletons known as arthropods—the ancestors of insects, spiders, and crustaceans. These toughened-up creatures represented a crucial innovation: hard bodies offering animals both a defense against enemies and a framework for supporting bigger body sizes.Trilobites, like this perfectly preserved specimen at South Dakota's Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, were among the most successful organisms ever to populate Earth. These familiar marine arthropods first arose about 545 million years ago in the early Cambrian and thrived throughout the world's oceans until they were wiped out in the Permian extinctions about 250 million years ago.The iconic arthropods of the Cambrian were the trilobites, which left a huge number of fossils. Trilobites had flattened, segmented, plated bodies that helped to protect them in seas that were increasingly filled with predators. With many varieties and sizes—they ranged from a millimeter to more than 2 feet (0.6 meters) in length—trilobites proved among the most successful and enduring of all prehistoric animals. More than 17,000 species are known to have survived until the mega-extinction that ended the Permian period 251 million years ago.A predator of the Cambrian was the giant, shrimplike Anomalocaris, which trapped its prey in fearsome mouthparts lined with hooks. Even stranger was the five-eyed Opabinia, which caught its victims using a flexible clawed arm attached to its head. These animals hunted along the seabed, where colonies of archaic sponges grew on organic, mineral structures formed by the activity of cyanobacteria. The sponges added to these reef habitats by building supporting skeletons from calcium carbonate, which they collected from the water.The earliest known primitive chordate is Pikaia gracilens, a wormlike creature that swam in middle Cambrian seas. Fossils found in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia show traces of a notochord (a rodlike primitive backbone), a significant step in the evolution of vertebrates.Cambrian sediments found in Canada, Greenland, and China have yielded rarely fossilized soft-bodied creatures such as marine worms buried during undersea mud avalanches. Representing the oldest known backboned animals with living relatives, the fossils showed that our vertebrate ancestors entered the evolutionary story some 50 million years earlier than previously thought.The end of the Cambrian saw a series of mass extinctions during which many shell-dwelling brachiopods and other animals went extinct. The trilobites also suffered heavy losses.",
"Seen in pastel artwork based on the view from a NASA IceBridge flight, Greenland's Hiawatha Glacier holds a startling new secret—and raises new questions about Earth's recent past. ("Hiawatha Basin, Greenland," soft pastel on paper, 2017.)Today, an international team of scientists describes what they say is a huge new impact crater that lies under northwestern Greenland’s Hiawatha Glacier. If confirmed, it would be the first impact crater on Earth discovered under ice, the team reports in the journal Science Advances. At an estimated 19 miles wide, it is larger than Washington, D.C., and would rank among the top 25 known craters in the world.“Until 2015, no one had paid much attention to this part of the planet,” says study coauthor Joseph MacGregor, a glaciologist with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. But that year, scientists began flying over the area with highly sensitive scanning instruments, such as lasers and radar, through NASA’s Operation IceBridge.Like all IceBridge data, the scans were made public, and a group of Danish glaciologists noticed something interesting when they reviewed the material: A large, bowl-shaped depression was clearly visible in the bedrock under the ice.“Could that be an impact crater? they asked,” MacGregor says. “They all laughed. But then they said, Maybe it is.”As they looked closer, someone on the team also pointed out that a large meteorite in the collection at the Natural History Museum of Denmark—near where they parked their bicycles every day—had come from that same region of Greenland.“We asked ourselves, could the two be linked?” says lead author Kurt Kjær, a glacial geologist and curator at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and the University of Copenhagen.To find out more, the Danish scientists reached out to MacGregor, who is the chief scientist for the IceBridge project. To get more high-resolution scans of the Hiawatha Glacier, the team also enlisted the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, which provided them with additional surveying flights in May 2016 carrying newer, more sensitive instruments. They also sent a ground team in July 2016 to map surrounding structures on the surface and collect samples of sediments that had drained out from under the glacier.With the precise radar data, the team was able to more completely work out the shape of the proposed crater. The walls of the circular rim are roughly 1,050 feet above the floor of the crater, they found. The team also identified an uplifted area 164 to 230 feet high in the center of the crater, which Kjær says is an expected feature and is the result of the force of the strike.In the sediment samples, the researchers found grains of what's known as shocked quartz—a rare form of the ubiquitous mineral that has been deformed in a characteristic way by very high-energy events, such as in a large impact. Some of the grains also showed a brown color known as toasting, again a sign of intense energy release. Other minerals showed signs of shock metamorphism, to the point of turning into glass.Based on the size of the crater, the team estimates that the asteroid would have been around 0.75 miles across and would have weighed 11 to 12 billion tons as it entered the atmosphere. And based on their mineral analysis, they believe it was an iron-rich space rock—the same type of rock as the meteorite fragment in the museum, although more tests would need to be done to establish a firm link, Kjær notes.Now that he knows the circular depression is there, Kjær adds that he can even see its outline on the surface of the ice.Comet C/2001 Q4, also known as NEAT, emits a blue-and-purple glow as it moves through the cosmos in May 2004. Its coma, or head, and a portion of its tail are visible in this shot, as are myriad stars. This image was taken by telescope from Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.MacGregor agrees: “I have a coffee mug with a three-inch map of Greenland on it. I can see the Hiawatha Glacier on there. So this really was hiding in plain sight.”But impact crater expert Ludovic Ferriere of the Natural History Museum in Vienna, who was not associated with the study, is skeptical of these conclusions.“I can say what they are presenting as shock quartz is definitely shock quartz,” says Ferriere, who is also a National Geographic Explorer. But he cautions that he would like to see a larger sample size of sediments tested, as he isn’t sure that the quartz taken from under the glacier necessarily came from the presumed impact crater.Kjær counters that they have many more samples still to sort through, grain by grain. And based on their radar mapping of the drainage system under the glacier, “where could the material come from if it didn’t come from inside the glacier?”Hiawatha Glacier has long been known but little studied, until recently.Ferriere also says that the uplift the team reports for such a large impact crater is too small for what should be expected. Either it isn’t what they suspect, or the uplift feature has been heavily eroded. Kjær responded that the impact through the ice sheet can explain the more muted central uplift, as well as the debris and sloping sediments they observed with radar.Both Kjær and Ferriere agree that the next steps likely include additional analysis of the existing samples, including the possibility of radioisotope dating, as well as collecting more material from the site. Ideally, the scientists say it would be best to drill through the glacier—which is nearly 0.6 miles thick over the crater—and into the rock below. A heavy drilling operation in such a remote area would be challenging and expensive, but not without precedent.“I think they have something here, but they make strong conclusions based on very preliminary data and a lot of gaps,” Ferriere says. “With drilling, they might find something very different.” As it stands, Ferriere argues, their discovery of the shock quartz “is like if you arrive on the scene of a murder and you find one poor guy there; he’s not necessarily the murderer.”The scientists also don’t currently have enough information to assign an age to the proposed impact crater, but based on their analysis, they have suggested bookends for the date of the event. Given the structure of the rock and ice that can be “read” with radar, the team believes that the glacier was in place at the time of the strike, and that the impact punched a hole in the ice and resulted in a significant amount of melting and refreezing. That would suggest that the impact happened sometime before the end of the Pleistocene epoch around 11,700 years ago.“It’s likely quite young, geologically speaking,” MacGregor says. “It’s likely less than three million years old and possibly as young as 12,000 to 15,000 years old.”If the discovery holds, the Hiawatha Crater could therefore be a tantalizing new piece of evidence for a very controversial idea. Called the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, the notion is that some kind of large impact occurred in northern North America about 10,900 to 12,900 years ago, during the Younger Dryas Ice Age. This impact, the idea goes, caused massive wildfires across much of the continent that in turn led to the extinction of many of the large Ice Age mammals, like mammoths and mastodons, as well as the human Clovis culture.One big problem with this hypothesis has long been the lack of a suitably large impact crater. If it's real and the dates match up, the Hiawatha Crater could be a plausible explanation, MacGregor says: “It’s a very speculative idea, but if this does turn out to be [the link], it would have had an outsize impact on human history.”“We do not discuss it in the paper, but I think it is a possibility,” Kjær adds. “This may generate a lot of discussion, and we need to find out. We won’t know until we have a proper date.”",

"Our small, grey satellite may be more active than long assumed, according to data from Apollo-era instruments placed on the moon.When building a remote outpost, it’s usually a good idea to stay away from active fault lines. Yet for people planning human habitation on the moon, it hasn't always been clear whether our tiny natural satellite is a geologically dead world. After all, you need internal heat for tectonic activity, and small rocky worlds like the moon are thought to cool much more rapidly than larger ones like Earth.But now, fresh analysis of Apollo-era data suggests that the moon is actually more tectonically active than previously presumed.In a study out today in Nature Geoscience, researchers may have finally pinpointed the epicenters of mysterious moonquakes recorded by Apollo-era seismometers, and the tremors seem to originate from cliff-like features called fault scarps.“The whole idea that a 4.6-billion-year-old rocky body like the moon has managed to stay hot enough in the interior and produce this network of faults just flies in the face of conventional wisdom,” says study coauthor Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.This summer will mark 50 years since the remarkable achievements of Apollo 11. Back during the space race, the United States was more focused on getting its astronauts to the lunar surface and back before the Soviets than on what to do with their moonwalkers while they were there.“They were like, Oh crap, we need to come up with some stuff,” says coauthor Renee Weber, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.That “stuff” ended up being science, such as collecting a wealth of geological data, including rocky samples brought back to Earth. And on four of the Apollo missions, astronauts placed seismometers at their landing sites, which recorded thousands of deep quakes over the eight years that they remained functional.Seismicity on the moon relies on quite different underlying mechanisms than what’s happening on our own world, Weber says. Most of the moon’s activity comes from gravitational forces that Earth exerts on its small gray satellite, essentially the converse of how the moon pulls on our oceans to cause the regular rise and fall of the tides. Without water, the lunar surface instead gets deformed, stretching from a spherical shape into a more oblong one and back again.Enormous day-to-night temperature shifts, which can exceed 500 degrees Fahrenheit, also drive some lunar seismic activity. A few of the detected quakes were even humanmade, created when mission control ordered expendable spaceship parts to crash into the moon to calibrate the seismometers.But 28 of the recorded events seemed to originate in the upper few miles of the lunar crust. These events were as powerful as magnitude 5.5 earthquakes on our planet, and they have defied explanation for more than 40 years.Since 2009, Watters has been using images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map thousands of scarps all around the moon. Based on how fresh the lunar material around them looked, he could tell that they had formed relatively recently, perhaps less than 50 million years ago, “which is young geologically, but not young, young,” he says.Still, Watters suspected that the scarps might be the sites responsible for the shallow moonquakes, but he needed further evidence. With four seismometers that produced relatively low-quality data, the Apollo instruments could only triangulate the tremors to within around a hundred miles.This seismic shakemap created from NASA images shows the expected motion for a shallow "moonquake" on a thrust fault associated with the Mandel’shtam scarp on the lunar surface.So the researchers used an algorithm normally employed to determine the location of quakes on Earth when seismometer networks are sparse, creating a grid of putative origin points for the lunar quakes. Of the 28 recorded events, eight might have occurred within around 18 miles of a scarp, and six of those happened when the moon was at its farthest point from Earth, just when tidal stresses on the lunar surface should peak. (Find out how advanced seismic networks revealed that California gets an earthquake roughly every three minutes.)To check whether the correlation might just be due to random chance, the team simulated 10,000 seismic events to see how often they might produce a pattern like this. They found that there were roughly one-percent odds that all these factors could line up in this way. For Watters, this suggests that the scarps are the most likely epicenters of the moonquakes.“That means, for all intents and purposes, the moon is tectonically active,” he says. “To me, that’s an amazing result.”Yet the uncertainties in the results mean that other researchers aren’t considering this a done deal just yet.“They use a lot of statistical arguments, and I think they do good science, but I wouldn’t say it’s definitely there,” says Ceri Nunn, who works on lunar seismology at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Still, given the non-ideal quality of the original data, she thinks the team seems to have pinned down the locations for the epicenters as well as possible for now.Weber and others are gearing up to propose a mission that would place a new network of state-of-the-art seismometers on the moon, perhaps with one touching down on or near a scarp.And in the meanwhile, given the renewed interest in lunar exploration from countries and private companies around the world, the findings provide a good map for places that upcoming landers might like to avoid.",
"In 1964, artists Pierre Mion and Davis Meltzer were working in a private room illustrating NASA’s plans for Apollo 11, the mission that ultimately placed the first humans on the moon in 1969.“We were looking at the actual plans of the spacecraft, and that was classified information.” Mion remembers. “We were literally locked in that room.”As an Apollo spacecraft slams into Earth's atmosphere, the three astronauts in this cutaway painting, kept safe by the capsule's heat shield, look through viewing ports and see glowing ablation vapors in the wake of their ship.Their illustrations of several moon missions—and some predictions for next steps in lunar living—ultimately appeared in National Geographic and other magazines throughout the Apollo era, offering eager readers a glimpse at off-world exploration based on the best science available at the time. (Here’s what NASA is planning now to send humans back to the moon.)“Knowing what the future would look like may have sapped from spaceflight some of its romance,” Matthew Hersch, science historian at Harvard University, says in an email. “But the knowledge that real spaceships would fly to the moon made up for it in public excitement.”A painting of the lunar module Eagle flying above the moon’s surface, which appeared in the March 1964 issue of National Geographic, includes a lunar landscape that doesn’t look much different from those in the satellite images we see today. In the early 1960s, however, the idea of crater-worn lunar terrain was at the cutting edge of planetary geology.Some scientists at the time thought that the moon would have harsh, jagged mountains without rain and wind to erode the surface. Others worried that moon dust would be so loose that anything that landed there would sink into it completely.Mion’s illustration is so accurate because he worked closely with astrogeologist Eugene Shoemaker, whose study of the moon’s craters showed that our natural satellite is covered in just a thin layer of fine dust, called regolith.“If he worked with Shoemaker, he couldn’t have been working with anybody better at that time,” says Tom Watters, senior scientist with the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. “[Shoemaker] did some of the most seminal work in planetary science.”This illustration shows the Apollo 11 lunar module's ascent stage lifting off from the moon, leaving behind the descent stage, a laser reflector, a TV camera, the astronauts’ backpacks, and an American flag. “I still have [this] painting, and it’s one of my favorites,” Mion says.Watters is currently a co-investigator with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, or LROC, which orbits the moon and takes high-resolution photographs of the surface. The camera can distinguish objects on the moon as small as three feet wide, including some of the remains of Apollo landing sites and the footprint paths the astronauts left behind.Watters compared LROC images of the Apollo 11 landing site with a December 1969 painting Mion made of the Lunar Module lifting off, an imagined view based in part on photographs taken by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as they walked on the moon.“That’s a pretty good depiction,” Watters remarked. “That’s not a bad job at all.”The illustrators also brought this attention to detail and scientific accuracy to their more predictive works.A close look at Meltzer’s 1969 illustration of a moon colony reveals a cafeteria, a hydroponic farm, and a ping-pong game. According to the original caption, “a small observatory studies the heavens, undimmed by Earth’s atmosphere.” In the distance, a “commuter rocket” is poised to return to Earth. (Also check out Carl Sagan’s 1967 predictions for what life on Mars might look like.)Most importantly, the base is situated almost entirely underground to protect the inhabitants from radiation, extreme temperatures, and other dangers they would face on the moon’s airless surface. For instance, between 2009 and 2016, LROC spotted over 200 new impact craters on the moon measuring up to 140 feet across.“Drawing on the most advanced thinking of experts, artist Davis Meltzer portrays a lunar outpost that might be possible in a generation,” reads the caption for this painting published in the February 1969 issue of National Geographic. One concept depicted here is mining moon rocks for water, which “not only fills the station’s swimming pool, but also yields oxygen for breathing and hydrogen for fuel.”“This one impressed me not so much in terms of the accuracy of the terrain, but the thinking about how you would build a habitat on the moon,” says Watters. “You would not want to have a habitat on the moon sitting on the surface and get hit by something that could create a ten-meter crater.” (Moon rocks collected during the Apollo missions are also revealing a surprising amount of water deep inside the moon.)While imaging the lunar surface, the LROC team also identified locations that might work well for moon bases. Watters says a top candidate would be a lava tunnel, a large cavern left behind after an ancient lunar lava flow. By building a base in a lava tunnel, future settlers could avoid the lengthy process of excavating a construction site underground.A cover illustration shows "a daring Gemini astronaut floating weightless, a thistledown in the vastness of space."When Meltzer’s moon base illustration was published, a lunar colony seemed like a straightforward next step in space exploration. Arthur C. Clarke’s 1968 The Promise of Space was quoted alongside Meltzer’s illustration: “It is strange to think that in a few more years, any amateur astronomer with a good telescope will be able to see the lights of the first expeditions, shining where no stars could ever be, within the arms of the crescent moon.”But so far, no country has accomplished that feat. After the first U.S. astronauts reached the moon in 1969, Hersch says, “changing priorities, economic difficulties, and the Vietnam War sapped funding for follow-up programs.” The last astronaut to stand on the moon, Eugene Cernan, left the lunar surface in December 1972.Still, as NASA makes progress with commercial spaceflight partnerships and its next rocket powerful enough to carry humans into deep space, the Space Launch System, these colorful visions are a reminder of humanity’s potential and an inspiration to keep reaching for the stars.",
"Astronaut Dave Scott pokes his head out of the Apollo 9 command module while it orbits Earth.With one small link and one giant leap in photo quality, a space enthusiast  has rocketed to Internet renown, creating a Flickr account full of high-definition, unprocessed photos from the Apollo moon missions.The more than 10,000 photos in the collection have been in the public domain for decades, but NASA has never made high-definition scans of the images accessible in one place online. That’s where Kipp Teague comes in. Teague is a private citizen and lifelong follower of NASA who runs the Project Apollo Archive, a website devoted to all things moon mission.In 2004 and 2005, Teague acquired several DVDs of photo scans from NASA’s Johnson Space Center, as he and his friend Eric Jones worked to spice up Jones’s own hobby history project—the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal—with extra images.Jones and Teague regularly published photos from Teague’s cache but they cropped, color-corrected, and compressed them, to the chagrin of some readers.After years of requests for the original high-resolution scans, Teague hit “kind of a tipping point” and began uploading his stash.Teague’s Flickr page supplements—and improves upon—other attempts to digitally archive the Apollo mission photos. NASA’s Human Spaceflight website, for instance, displays many of them, as does the Lunar and Planetary Institute’s Apollo Image Atlas, but navigating the sites just for the photos can be tedious. What’s more, seeing all of the images at once on Flickr gives the collection a more familiar, unguarded feel, like looking through the snapshots of a friend’s road trip.Seeing the photos en masse also underscores how difficult it can be to find the iconic, beautiful needle in a photographic haystack. Currently, there are over 11,000 pictures in Teague’s archive; National Geographic photo editor Mallory Benedict found 18 she thought would work for this gallery. And that’s a fairly typical culling at National Geographic. “Sometimes, we get thousands [of photos], and we’ll end up with five,” Benedict says.Teague, who works full-time as an IT administrator at Lynchburg College in Lynchburg, Virginia, has been surprised by the large and overwhelmingly positive reaction to his uploads. “It’s astonishing,” he says. “Clearly, there’s a good interest to see this material.”“I could not leave this world with this stuff sitting on my shelf,” he adds.Here are our favorites from the collection.

"A joint NASA and Navy recovery team recently spent a week aboard the USS Anchorage testing procedures and ground-support equipment for the Orion spacecraft, NASA's next capsule for sending humans into space.NASA has been subjecting its Orion space capsule to a battery of tests designed to tell whether the spacecraft is ready to ferry humans into orbit and beyond. So far, the capsule seems to be on track—in a series of maneuvers this week, a joint team of NASA and U.S. Navy specialists successfully recovered the spaceship from the sea off the coast of San Diego, simulating what would happen when a deep-space mission splashed back to Earth.If all goes to plan, Orion will become NASA’s flagship technology for launching astronauts to orbit and even to deep space, including to the lunar surface and maybe Mars. Here’s what’s at stake with Orion, and what still needs to be done before it can blast off.Yes, but not on NASA spacecraft. The space shuttle program ended in 2011, and the remaining shuttles are now on display in museums around the country. Since then, American astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station on Russian rockets, and NASA has sent supplies to the ISS via SpaceX and Orbital ATK launches.Until Orion becomes available, NASA astronauts have no other way to get to low-Earth orbit and beyond. Commercial space companies like SpaceX and Boeing are developing their own crew capsules capable of reaching the ISS. But when it comes to sending people to the moon or deeper into space, it's not clear yet who will be first to the launch pad.Orion is the part that holds the astronauts and research equipment, like a bigger and much improved version of the Apollo capsules. It will be combined with the Space Launch System, a new rocket that is under development and being tested at the same time. Although it has been criticized for excessive costs and delays, the SLS continues to move forward. When ready, it will be more powerful than its competitors, including SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, which is due to take its maiden voyage in the coming weeks.Orion is designed with a heat shield that can withstand temperatures up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it reenters the atmosphere. Once the capsule slows from 25,000 miles an hour to “only” 300 miles an hour on its descent, it will deploy parachutes to slow it down even more and splash down as gently as possible off the coast of San Diego, where naval ships will be waiting for it. Navy divers will set up a floating platform around the crew module bobbing in the water so that they can first recover the astronauts.“The crew might feel wobbly,” after their time in space and reentry, says Charles Lundquist, Orion deputy program manager. The recovery team will then attach a winch to Orion and pull it onto the ship’s well deck so the capsule can be reused.This week, NASA has been testing the processes for recovering Orion with the U.S.S. Anchorage, using a mock-up capsule that has about the same size, shape, weight, and center of gravity of the real thing. They’re also testing ground-support equipment, the heat shield, parachute systems, and all the electronics and software. All the components need to come together for Orion’s first big mission.Astronaut Stephen G. Bowen evokes the memories of Apollo 1 and the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia as he emphasizes “how critical it is that we get this right.” Safety is foremost on NASA scientists’ and engineers’ minds as they try to minimize the risks of space travel.Once it detaches from the SLS and has the right trajectory, Orion will fly past the moon and return to Earth over a three-week period. Exploration Mission 1, as it’s called, is slated to launch in December 2019, but that date could get pushed back into the following year.The first mission will be uncrewed, but subsequent ones will be more ambitious. NASA currently plans to use Orion to help astronauts build a new space station beyond Earth’s atmosphere, dubbed Deep Space Gateway. Such a station would enable more research on the moon as well as allowing ships to be assembled in space for even more distant missions.That’s the plan for now, but it probably wouldn’t happen until the mid-2030s. NASA’s long-term “Journey to Mars” depends on the success of a bunch of missions between now and then, starting with this Orion demonstration. (SpaceX also wants to go to Mars, but there are lots of reasons why humans aren’t there yet.)Unlike the Apollo program, which focused entirely on getting humans on the moon, NASA is trying to make Orion versatile enough to handle a wide range of missions. It would be capable of lunar missions, satisfying Trump’s objectives—for the most part. Trump wanted NASA to send astronauts on Orion’s maiden voyage around the moon, but the agency decided that the additional costs, time, and risks outweighed the benefits.Since there won’t be astronauts on board, they’ll instead use the first mission to test the limits of the spacecraft. They’ll also ensure that the communication systems work like they’re supposed to, since some processes will be piloted from the ground.Assuming the tests continue to go well, NASA plans to put the real Orion’s components together at Kennedy Space Center in Florida by the end of this year, and then they’ll ship the whole thing to the Plum Brook Facility in Ohio, where they’ll subject it to final tests that simulate the vacuum and frigid temperature of space. Then they’ll send it back to Florida to prepare for launch.",
"There's even more water on the moon than we previously thought, according to new analysis of tiny glass beads left over from ancient volcanic eruptions.The naturally occurring beads were collected in the 1970s as part of the Apollo 15 and 17 missions, which landed near zones of volcanic activity. The beads formed when magma bursting onto the surface crystallized in such a way that water became trapped inside.However, scientists couldn’t be sure if the Apollo samples are unique or if other volcanic flows on the moon are filled with water-bearing glass. (Find out how flying oceans of magma help demystify the moon's creation.)In a new study published today in Nature Geoscience, scientists reexamined the Apollo samples and used more recent satellite data to look for signs of water-bearing beads elsewhere on the moon. They found that the volcanic deposits are indeed widespread, which suggests that the material inside the moon is wetter than previously thought.“The fact that they see this feature associated with the glasses tells us that there was indeed quite a bit of water in the interior of the moon when these volcanic eruptions were occurring,” says Anthony Colaprete, a NASA scientist who reviewed the paper.Here’s what we now know about water on the moon.Scientists used to think the moon was completely devoid of water, but recent studies have proven that false.Yes, but only very recently. Scientists used to think the entire moon was bone-dry. But in 2008, researchers examined those glass beads from the Apollo samples and found the first known trace amounts of water.From that point on, lunar water discoveries started gushing. In 2009, NASA crashed a rocket and a satellite into a crater on the moon’s south pole, in the hopes of picking up additional watery evidence. The crashes gave off signatures associated with water ice and hydroxyl—a highly reactive molecule associated with water.And in 2010, scientists looked closer at other collected moon rocks and found more signatures of water in a mineral called apatite. That’s when geologists began suspecting that the moon holds hidden reservoirs locked in its rocks. If you were to take all of the water in the moon’s interior, it would create a one-yard-deep ocean covering the entire surface, geologist Francis McCubbin estimated at the time.While we’ve mapped a good amount of the moon’s surface water, we don’t know for sure what the interior of the moon is like, in part because we have very few samples of volcanic rocks belched up from the lunar mantle.For their study, Ralph Milliken of Brown University and Shuai Li at the University of Hawaii wanted to find out more about the amount of water inside the moon. (See rare pictures of the moon captured by Apollo astronauts.) The study is one of the first to try and answer this question using satellite mapping of volcanic debris called pyroclastic flows.Unfortunately, while this study suggests water is indeed more abundant inside the moon, it’s hard to know for sure how much exists.Studies from 2011 revealed that the volcanic beads contained similar amounts of water as volcanic basalts on Earth. And deep within our planet, there is probably more water than all of the surface oceans, lakes, and rivers combined.This map shows where the volcanic glass deposits are located on the surface of the moon.This new finding could mean that at least part of the moon’s mantle might have as much water as Earth’s. (Read more about how Saturn's largest moon could have the components needed for life.)Even though the glass beads contain only 0.05 percent water, the sheer amount of them presents a tantalizing opportunity for future moonwalkers. Water ice in deeply shadowed polar craters would be much harder to reach than the water-bearing volcanic rocks spread across the moon. That means lunar visitors could one day extract this water rather than having to bring their own supplies.“This is actually very useful,” says Colaprete. “We can actually now have a better handle on these deposits as a potential lunar resource going forward and can be compared to future studies of polar resources.”Follow Hannah Lang on Twitter.",
"The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off from launchpad 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on February 6.Kennedy Space Center, FloridaAn extraordinary ballet was danced through the skies over central Florida on Tuesday, as SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket passed its first test launch with (mostly) flying colors.With its highly anticipated first flight behind it, the Falcon Heavy is now the world's most powerful operational rocket by a factor of two, capable of lifting 140,000 pounds of cargo into low-Earth orbit. Only the Saturn V rocket that sent humans to the moon has lifted so much, so far."I'm still trying to absorb everything that happened. It seemed surreal to me," SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post-launch press briefing on Tuesday. "I had this image of an explosion on the pad, a wheel bouncing down the road, and the [SpaceX] logo landing somewhere—but fortunately, that didn't happen."On the morning of the flight, excitement at NASA's Kennedy Space Center was palpable. Five hours before launch, more than a mile of traffic snaked out of the visitor complex's entrance, backing up past the brand-new factory of SpaceX competitor Blue Origin.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Falcon Heavy's 27 Merlin rocket engines staggered to life with a triumphant roar that could be heard for miles. The rocket lifted off from NASA's launchpad 39A—the point of departure for the Apollo moon missions and the space shuttle fleet—and began its ascent, carrying with it a modified Tesla Roadster blaring David Bowie's “Space Oddity.”In eight short minutes, Falcon Heavy's side boosters separated from the main stack, pirouetted in mid-air, and returned to land, as if the launch were being rewound.The center section continued upward until it jettisoned the rocket's upper stage, and then it turned around to land on SpaceX's drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, which was bobbing along in the Atlantic Ocean. In the launch's immediate aftermath, it was unclear whether the center core stuck its landing.Minutes after The Verge broke the news, Musk confirmed that the Falcon Heavy's center core missed its target drone ship, as many had feared. Musk attributed it to low levels of triethylborane—a hot-burning propellant that essentially acts as rocket engines' starter fluid—in the center booster. Not all of that booster's engines reignited during its descent, making it come down far faster than expected.  "Apparently, it hit the water at 300 miles an hour," said Musk, who added that the collision took out two of the drone ship's engines.The missed landing, however, didn't disrupt an otherwise by-the-book launch. The Falcon Heavy's upper stage cleanly separated from the center booster, carrying the Roadster and its dummy-astronaut passenger aloft. Now, the vehicle is spending a foreboding five hours in the Van Allen belt, a swath of high-energy solar particles trapped by Earth's magnetic field.The punishing radiation doesn't seem to have damaged the upper stage. At 10:46 p.m. ET, Musk confirmed in a statement on Twitter that the upper stage engine fired with enough power to kick the Tesla beyond the confines of Earth's gravity.True to Bowie, the car is now floating in a most peculiar way: It's tracking on an elliptical orbit around the sun that will take it from Earth's orbit to the asteroid belt and back again.SpaceX says that the Roadster could stably float out there for millions of years. And for a short while, at least, earthlings will get to ride along, thanks to three cameras mounted on the Roadster."It's a normal car in space—I like the absurdity of that," said Musk. "It's still tripping me out."As National Geographic reported on Monday, the Falcon Heavy is poised to serve as a potent symbol for private enterprise's rush into space—which SpaceX has shaken up by emphasizing reusability.Most rockets are designed with multiple parts, or stages, that help get the main compartment carrying the payload—the satellites and crew capsules—into space. The stages usually break away and fall back to Earth when they are spent. In many cases, those stages cannot be safely reused.But since 2008, SpaceX has set a number of spaceflight firsts with its Falcon 9 rocket, including successfully recovering and reusing some of its rocket stages, which helps bring down the costs of space travel. SpaceX's competitors charge more than three times the price of SpaceX for launching payloads half as massive as those possible with the Falcon Heavy. (Read more about what the SpaceX success means.)“It's been a total shot across the bow,” said John Logsdon, a space-policy expert at George Washington University, in an interview on Sunday.After three failed launches, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk scraped together enough funding to launch a fourth version of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket. On September 28, 2008, Musk's gamble paid off when the Falcon 1 became the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to orbit Earth. The rocket is seen here lifting off from the Reagan Test Site in the Marshall Islands.Now that Falcon Heavy seems to work, SpaceX will likely move ahead with its existing manifest, which includes the Saudi satellite Arabsat 6a and the U.S. Air Force's STP-2, a variety pack of satellites that includes a hyper-accurate atomic clock designed for deep space and a network of satellites that will monitor Earth's atmosphere.“If we're successful in this, it is game over,” Musk said in a press briefing on Monday. “It'd be like ... if one aircraft company had reusable aircraft and all the other aircraft companies were single-use, you parachuted out at your destination, and your plane randomly crashed somewhere.”In some ways, though, the Falcon Heavy is an odd fit for the current rocketry market. SpaceX has effectively undercut the satellite market for Falcon Heavy by constantly upgrading its current workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, and squeezing more performance out of it.It's also unlikely that Falcon Heavy will launch humans off of Earth; Musk says that the Falcon Heavy probably won't go through the arduous certification process that crew-carrying rockets must endure. Instead, SpaceX will leapfrog straight to its Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, a gargantuan spaceship and 31-engine booster that would fulfill Musk's vision of interplanetary humans.Here's how the SpaceX Falcon Heavy stacks up against some of the other heavy-lift launch vehicles that have successfully carried cargo and, in some cases, crew into orbit (click to enlarge).It may sound ambitious, but Musk says that the BFR may be right around the corner. To the collective shock of reporters on the scene, Musk said in the Falcon Heavy post-launch briefing that he'd like to see SpaceX begin testing the BFR spaceship in short vertical hops next year. What's more, he says that SpaceX is aiming to land BFR cargo missions on Mars by 2022.However, Musk himself admits that this hyper-aggressive timeline is “aspirational.” Consider, too, that the Falcon Heavy was beset by years of redesigns and delays.In the meantime, it's possible that the Falcon Heavy will serve a greater role in scientific launches, sending smallish instruments to elsewhere in the solar system with astounding speed. As the Trump administration's National Space Council grapples with the future of human space exploration, it's also possible that Falcon Heavy will feature prominently in NASA's plans to return humans to the moon, or send them even farther."It can launch things straight to Pluto and beyond. It can launch satellites—it can do anything," Musk said.“If I were a missions designer, as I was way back when, and I got the Falcon Heavy in my toolkit, I'd immediately start running launch scenarios—how much tonnage can I get in orbit around the moon?” says G. Scott Hubbard, a Stanford University aeronautics expert and former head of the NASA Ames Research Center. “That would immediately become part of your planning.”But the path forward for Falcon Heavy is hardly smooth. To land high-priority, must-work launches, any rocket worth its salt must be demonstrated as reliable. A single launch shows that there are no fatal design flaws, but more launches are needed to prove the vehicle's long-term viability.“It doesn't matter how much money you save if you lose your payload, because the government doesn't insure it—it can't insure it,” says Casey Dreier, the space policy director of the Planetary Society. “Reliability is going to be the key factor.”What's more, SpaceX is hardly alone. As The Verge's Loren Grush noted in May, SpaceX and its competitors are barreling toward developing ever-more capable rockets, some of which may overlap with NASA's in-progress Space Launch System megarocket.No matter which rocket wins hearts and contracts, Musk and others in the space community remain resolute that these kinds of advances in spaceflight represent big ideas that can fundamentally change the human experience.“Why are we doing this? It's to do two things: It’s to advance human presence in any form beyond Earth [and] being able to send spacecraft, telescopes, people further out beyond low-Earth orbit,” says Dreier. “We're building a capability to challenge ourselves to explore and understand the cosmos, which is actually a really beautiful thing that we do as a species.”Musk would add a third component to the pursuit: "I want a space race," he said. "Races are exciting."",
"This image, created with data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, shows the pockmarked surface of the moon's far side. The South Pole-Aitken basin, shown here in shades of blue, is the oldest and largest known impact basin in the solar system, spanning some 1,550 miles.Researchers have discovered something massive lurking underneath the far side of the moon: a mysterious blob with the mass akin to a pile of metal five times the size of the Big Island of Hawaii.The structure, described in a recent study published in Geophysical Research Letters, sits at least 180 miles beneath the South Pole-Aitken basin—a colossal crater punched into the lunar landscape billions of years ago, when the moon's initially molten surface had cooled just enough for impacts to leave a lasting mark.The team discovered the anomalous blob by combining data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory, or GRAIL, mission with topography from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. This data helped them refine past calculations for the thickness of the crater's crust and the density of the mantle, revealing the odd underground excess of mass.The blob is likely related to the crater's formation, and it may be the remnants of an ancient impactor's metal core, says study coauthor Peter James of Baylor University. While the excess mass isn't immediately obvious from the surface, it does seem to be having quite an effect, dragging down the lunar landscape in a curious ovoid depression that sits more than half a mile lower than the surrounding crater floor, a feature known as the central depression.“That’s a huge result,” says Daniel Moriarty, a lunar geologist with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. “It really gives us a hint of what’s going on in the lunar interior.”This false-color image shows the topography on the far side of the moon, with highs in warm colors and lows in cool colors. A dashed circle indicates the zone of excess mass under the South Pole-Aitken basin.In the past, the South Pole-Aitken crater has garnered plenty of interest both for its surface composition and its size. (Learn more about strange rocks found in the South Pole-Aitken basin that may have come from deep inside the moon.)“It’s the biggest preserved crater that we know of in the solar system,” James says. The discovery of the odd mass only adds to the intrigue, especially since the crater and the nearby lunar south pole are potential targets for multiple future missions to the moon.Scientists are already raring to study the mass. Such an effort could help unravel the history behind the monumental impact that created the crater—and fill in crucial details in our understanding of how our lunar companion and other celestial bodies grow over time.“As an impact modeler, it’s very exciting,” says Brandon Johnson, a planetary scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the new study. “I can’t wait to possibly get started working on this.”The GRAIL mission's duo of spacecraft—dubbed Ebb and Flow—launched in 2011 and orbited the moon for nearly a year, precisely charting variations in the lunar gravitational field. Using this data, the GRAIL team constructed the highest-resolution gravity map of our lunar companion yet.The data give a loose picture of what's happening both on the surface and underground. The more mass there is, like higher topography or denser rocks, the stronger the gravity. These maps highlight a striking difference between most of the moon's large craters and the South Pole-Aitken basin.Other large craters have what are known as mascons, short for mass concentrations. Discovered in 1968 by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, mascons show up in gravity maps as bullseyes—a central circle of strong gravity surrounded by a ring of weak gravity and then another ring of stronger gravity. The phenomenon is a consequence of the way low-density crust and high-density mantle adjust after an impact.But the South Pole-Aitken basin doesn't have such a pattern. So to figure out what was going on under the surface, the scientists turned to calculations, creating a model using new assumptions about the forces at play that more accurately reflects the natural system. The result revealed the large zone of dense material that sits within the moon's upper mantle.The team suggests two possibilities to explain the subsurface mass. First, it could be remnants of dense oxides that formed in the final stages of cooling back when the moon was covered in ancient magma oceans. But the researchers don't have a mechanism to precisely explain the formation of such a layer specifically under the basin.“Why would it be there, of all places?” James asks.Instead, the mass could come from an ancient impactor, the team argues. The space rock that formed the moon's giant basin was likely large enough to have separated into different layers when it first formed, so that like many of today's planets, it sported a dense, metallic core and rocky outer layers.On the fateful day of its collision, the energy of the impact carved a deep bowl-shaped crater on the moon, with the impactor's metallic core smashed up inside. But the original hole didn't last, and the divot on the moon partially refilled with molten rock. Within it lingered the melty traces of the ancient impactor's core.“That's what I would bet on,” James says.“It’s really convincing that there’s something there,” Johnson says, agreeing that a core relic is a likely explanation. “The whole time I was reading [the study], I was thinking about all the different ways we can follow up and try to better understand what is causing this mass anomaly that they've found."In addition to spotting the mysterious blob, the new study retraced the boundary of the basin's inner rim, revealing that scientists previously underestimated the crater's size, a potentially important find as NASA and others prepare to send missions to the basin and the nearby lunar south pole. The last researchers to map out these limits used data from the Clementine mission, which had a gap near the basin's southern extent. The latest work, however, used more complete data from LRO and GRAIL, which revealed that the crater is roughly 40 miles larger than once thought.Overall, the work deepens the curiosity already surrounding the South Pole-Aitken basin.“It's just so mysterious,” says Sara Mazrouei of Western University's Center for Planetary Science and Exploration, who was not involved in the work. And by improving our understanding of this structure, scientists hope to better understand the formation of bodies throughout our celestial family.“Every planet in our solar system was formed by little things smacking into each other and eventually forming bigger things,” Moriarty says.On Earth, the perpetual churn of plate tectonics has been steadily erasing the planet's ancient surface and its record of early impacts. But the moon, still sporting a surface that's billions of years old, serves as an incredible record of what happened when our solar system was merely an infant—including the dramatic events that formed one of the largest known impact basins in our cosmic neighborhood. (Find out why scientists now think the moon may still have some tectonic activity.)“There’s so much we don’t understand about the exact process that formed it,” Moriarty says about the South Pole-Aitken basin. “This is a huge, huge, huge area of current research.”",
"This image from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter centers on the South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest impact basin on the moon and one of the largest in the solar system. The distance from its depths to the tops of the highest surrounding peaks is nearly 10 miles.Kicking off the new year with a bang, China made history in early January by landing the first-ever spacecraft on the far side of the moon. Now, results from that mission suggest another bombshell: the first signs of lunar mantle material available for scientific study.Yutu-2, the rover partner to the Chang’e-4 lander, used reflected radiation to analyze the minerals within its landing site inside the moon’s Von Kármán crater. In doing so, it spotted layers rich in two mineral types that aren’t a match for typical lunar crust. The study authors argue that it is likely these mineral patches represent upper mantle material, according to work appearing today in the journal Nature.If confirmed, mantle rock from the moon would give researchers a game-changing look at our celestial companion’s inner workings, perhaps helping to solve long-standing mysteries about the moon’s formation and evolution. (Find out why geologists now think the moon may be more tectonically active than previously realized.)“If this really is a bit of the mantle, then that is so cool,” says Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum in London.What we know about the moon, from how it came to be to how it’s behaving today, is often due to the samples brought back by the Apollo missions, which all landed on the moon’s near side. These rocks are invaluable, but they only tell a tiny part of the story, since they are all lunar surface material from a very small section of the moon. The moon’s mantle, a solid layer beneath the crust that was once hotter and more toothpaste-like, remains far more mysterious, and scientists have been yearning for samples of it for decades.A genuine lunar mantle sample would represent a “critical piece of the jigsaw” found at long last, Russell says. Some researchers, however, have expressed uncertainty about how conclusive the study’s claim is at this stage.“This is an exciting step forward,” says Clive Neal, an expert in lunar geology at the University of Notre Dame, but alternative explanations need to be explored further before he considers it a slam dunk.The Chang’e-4 mission is unquestionably unprecedented. All prior successful lunar landings, by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, landed on the moon’s near side, partly because of logistical problems landing on the far side.China is now the first and only country with a rover exploring the far side. Its landing spot in Von Kármán crater is in the middle of the colossal South Pole-Aitken basin, a 1,550-mile-wide ancient crater that is among the largest impact structures in the solar system. That makes it a plausible place to hunt for lunar mantle, which is one of the reasons why the China National Space Administration was keen to land there. (Find out why multiple space agencies are racing to explore the moon’s south pole.)“Numerical models of the impact event indicate it should have blasted through the lunar crust to excavate mantle material located below,” says Bill Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute.“If you’re going to find mantle material anywhere, the South Pole-Aitken basin is the best place to go,” Russell adds.A picture taken from orbit shows craters around the Chang'e-4 landing site near the lunar south pole.Scientists suspect that the moon was covered in a magma ocean during its very early days. As it progressively cooled and solidified, denser minerals remained in the ocean’s depths while less dense minerals floated to the surface. This meant the geochemical compositions of the eventual mantle and crust layers turned out to be distinct from each other.Driving around Von Kármán, the Yutu-2 rover found material that, according to its spectrometer, looked to contain at least two minerals: low-calcium pyroxene and olivine. These would be a good match for what models predict the moon’s upper mantle would contain.The researchers suspect that when the entire basin formed, it scattered mantle material all across the lunar surface. Later on, a less powerful impact formed the smaller Finsen crater, and the team speculates that this event jettisoned previously excavated mantle material into the nearby Von Kármán crater.If the sample is truly mantle material, its composition won’t solely record the moon’s magmatic and thermal evolution, says lead study author Chunlai Li from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Some of Earth’s early history is locked up in the lunar underworld, too. (Also find out about a moon rock that may be the oldest known piece of Earth.)The most widely accepted theory is that moon was born when a massive protoplanet slammed into young Earth, sending plenty of terrestrial building blocks into orbit around it. Earth has destroyed much of its oldest geological history through plate tectonics, but there is every chance that echoes of it have been chronicled within the underbelly of the far less self-destructive moon.The team cannot say for sure that the spectrometer is unequivocally seeing mantle material. Study coauthor Bin Liu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says that the mission will need to gather much more spectral data to help validate these early interpretations.Bottke favors the idea that the material is the exposed early mantle, but he agrees that other possibilities cannot be ruled out yet. One alternative explanation, he says, is that the material is the solidified melt from the impact that created the basin in the first place. Or it could be a feature of the solidified lava that is known to exist within the crater, Neal says.Daniel Moriarty, a lunar geologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, is also cautious. Japan’s spectrometer-armed Kaguya orbiter spied volcanic glass within Von Kármán crater and other craters nearby, he notes. To a spectrometer, olivine and volcanic glass can look quite similar, which means that Yutu-2 could have found volcanic glass, not mantle minerals.There also isn’t much evidence for olivine within Finsen crater, the supposed source of the mantle material seen in Von Kármán crater, he says. He suspects that a fresher crater in the middle of Von Kármán is the far more likely source of the features Yutu-2 is looking at.Both Neal and Russell say that this study demonstrates why it’s important to fund more missions that will return lunar samples to Earth, where they can be analyzed thoroughly in a lab. Fortunately, China is already on the case. It’s upcoming Chang’e-5 mission will send near-side lunar samples back to terra firma, and its Chang’e-6 mission aims to do the same with samples from the lunar south pole.Until that happens, scientists will probably not agree on whether Chang’e-4 has really found mantle material. What they do agree on, however, is that the new study is nothing less than a pioneering feat.“Although I’m fairly skeptical of some of their interpretations of their measurements, I think the fact that they even made these measurements is an incredible achievement,” Moriarty says. “That's really done a lot to advance lunar science and exploration.”",
"This artist's impression from the China National Space Administration (CNSA) depicts China's Chang'e-4 lunar probe. The spacecraft is the first ever to land on the moon's far side.On the evening of January 2, a Chinese lander named for an ancient moon goddess touched down on the lunar far side, where no human or robot has ever ventured before. China's Chang'e-4 mission launched toward the moon on December 7 and entered orbit around our cosmic companion on December 12. Now, the spacecraft has alighted onto the lunar surface.Leading up to the historic touchdown, details on Chang'e-4's landing were few and far between. CNSA is notoriously secretive; the last update offered was on December 30, when officials stated that the spacecraft had entered its final pre-landing orbit. Around the world, scientists and enthusiasts huddled in online forums and on Twitter before the landing, trading whispers as they read the latest from well-sourced journalists, Weibo accounts, and amateur astronomers tracking Chang'e-4's orbit.Once confirmation came that Chang'e-4 touched down, though, uncertainty gave way to joy."It's really a historic time, and I am very very excited!" Long Xiao, a planetary geoscientist at the China University of Geosciences, wrote in an email to National Geographic just after he received word of the landing. "With the successful landing and taking pictures by both the lander and rover soon, I am looking forward to see the real face of the far side!""I personally feel very excited and proud of the successful landing of Chang'e-4, as this is not only a really impressive accomplishment, but also has many scientific potentials," added Le Qiao, a lunar geologist at Shandong University, Weihai.Want to know more about the mission, its scientific goals, and its global significance? We've got you covered.The Chang'e-4 probe is the latest mission sent to the moon by CNSA, the Chinese space agency. The first two lunar missions were orbiters, and the third was a lander-rover combo that successfully landed on the near side of the moon in 2013. Chang'e-4 consists of a lander and a rover, as well as a relay satellite, and its goal is to set down gently on the lunar far side. (See stunning pictures from the Chang'e-3 mission.)“It's the first of its kind,” says Notre Dame planetary scientist Clive Neal, an expert on the moon's geology. “Chang'e-4 represents the first time that any nation has attempted to put down a soft lander on the far side of the moon, to then deploy a rover to explore.”"The retuned data should provide us valuable information to disclose the secrets of our moon, from the never-touched side!" Xiao wrote. "My fingers are crossed!"The moon has orbited Earth for more than 4.5 billion years, and over that time, Earth's gravitational tug has forced the moon's rotation speed to sync up with its orbit. As a result, the moon both rotates on its axis and orbits Earth once every 28 days. That means the same side of the moon always faces Earth, and the far side is the half we can't see from the planet's surface.You may have heard the far side referred to as the “dark side” of the moon, but that's a misnomer. As the moon orbits Earth, precisely half of it is bathed in sunlight at all times. During a new moon, the lunar near side is plunged into darkness, but the far side is fully lit. In fact, the moon's far side is lighter in color since it lacks the near side's darker basins, which create the patterns that we see as human faces, rabbits, or toads.It's difficult to maintain communication with Earth during a far-side landing, because the moon itself blocks radio contact. When Apollo astronauts orbited to the moon's far side, they were totally cut off from the rest of humankind.This image from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter centers on the South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest impact basin on the moon and one of the largest in the solar system. The distance from its depths to the tops of the highest surrounding peaks is nearly 10 miles.The Chang'e-4 mission has gotten around this problem with a relay satellite. In May 2018, CNSA launched a satellite called Queqiao into orbit around L2, a neutral point beyond the moon where the gravity of Earth and the moon cancel out the centripetal force of an object stationed there, effectively allowing it to park in place. Since Queqiao always has good sight lines to both Earth and the lunar far side, it will bridge the gap between mission control and the Chang'e-4 lander.That said, adding a relay means radio signals must cross a greater distance, which in turn lengthens the round-trip communications delay. This means that any far-side lander or rover, including Chang'e-4, must be able to select its landing site and avoid hazards on its own.CNSA targeted the Von Kármán crater within the moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, a low-lying feature more than 1,500 miles across that covers nearly a quarter of the moon's surface. The basin is thought to have formed from a huge impact, so studying it should reveal details on the moon's crust and interior.“It's basically the biggest hole in the solar system,” Neal says.Scientists on the Chang'e-4 team are interested in ancient craters within the basin, such as Von Kármán, so they can study the craters' compositions and ages. These craters record the various rates of impacts that the moon, and thus Earth, endured over their history. How many objects rained down on Earth in our planet's youth? What did these objects bring, and when did they arrive? What does this history mean for the origins of life? Chang'e-4 could help us find out.Many of the instruments aboard Chang'e-4 are replicas of ones that flew on Chang'e-3, the mission's predecessor. These hand-me-downs include several cameras, including the one that Chang'e-3 used to take awe-inspiring panoramas of the lunar surface. Chang'e-4 also comes equipped with radar that can penetrate the moon's surface.Unlike Chang'e-3, Chang'e-4 is carrying a "lunar biosphere" experiment containing plant seeds and silkworm eggs, as well as a low-frequency radio spectrometer that will let researchers study the sun's high-energy atmosphere from afar. This instrument has an extra trick: By pairing it with an instrument on board Queqiao, Chinese researchers can use the two as a radio telescope. The moon's far side is ideal for radio astronomy, since the moon blocks noise from Earth's ionosphere and human radio transmissions."This will allow us for the first time to do radio observation at low frequencies that are not possible from Earth, from close to the moon and on the moon," wrote Radboud University astronomer Marc Klein Wolt, the project lead for Queqiao's radio instrument, in an email. "This will pave the way for a future large radio facility on the moon to study the very early universe in the period before the first stars where formed."Not all of Chang'e-4's instruments are Chinese. The mission's scientists teamed up with German researchers to install a particle detector on the lander, and Swedish researchers put an ion detector on the rover. The radio-telescope instrument on Queqiao is a joint Dutch-Chinese effort.Even if NASA and CNSA wanted to, it'd be very difficult for the U.S. space agency to work with China legally. A rule nicknamed the Wolf amendment forbids NASA from working with any Chinese entity unless the project is explicitly authorized by Congress or certified by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.The rule's proponents argue that it helps U.S. national security, since CNSA has ties to China's military, and space technologies can be used for both peace and war. However, many scientists in the U.S. have derided the rule as needlessly restrictive, especially since China can already launch humans into space, service its own space stations, and send scientific probes such as Chang'e-4.“Maybe this Wolf amendment doesn’t have any teeth, except to prohibit cooperation that would be of benefit to all,” Neal says. “You have to have international collaboration.”There are models for countries cooperating in space even when tensions persist back on Earth. During the Cold War, the U.S. worked with the U.S.S.R. for projects such as the Apollo-Soyuz mission. Some observers, such as Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins, even advocated for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to embark on a joint Mars mission. (Read Collins's plan in the November 1988 issue of National Geographic magazine.)China has big plans for its lunar exploration program. Its next mission, Chang'e-5, will attempt to land on the moon's surface and return samples to Earth. If China is successful, it would be just the third country to send stuff back from the moon, and the second country to do so with robots. While details are slim, Chinese researchers outlining the country's post-2020 moon plans have also discussed sending humans to the moon and building a base there.They're not alone. The European Space Agency has announced its goal of building a “moon village.” ISRO, the Indian space agency, will soon launch its Chandrayaan-2 probe to the moon's south pole. And NASA is working with private companies to send more scientific payloads to the moon while outlining bold—if vague—ambitions to place a “gateway” space station near the moon in the 2020s.“If at some point we can marshal the world's resources to do these things, we're going to be a lot better off,” says Kurt Klaus, the commercial lead for the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group, which supports NASA's moon missions. “But how far away we are from that, I don't know.”",
"Apollo 17 mission Commander Eugene Cernan checks out the lunar roving vehicle (LRV) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site in December 1972. LRVs, also called moon buggies, are electric vehicles designed to expand astronauts' range of exploration on the low-gravity surface of the moon. The east end of the moon's South Massif rises in the background at right.For as long as humans have gazed skyward, the moon has been a focus of fascination. We could always see our cosmic partner’s mottled, cratered face by eye. Later, telescopes sharpened our views of its bumps, ridges, and relict lava seas. Finally, in the mid-20th century, humans visited Earth’s moon and saw its surface up close.Since then, a volley of spacecraft have studied our nearest celestial neighbor, swooping low over its dusty plains and surveying its curious far side. Now, after six decades of exploration, we are once again aiming to send humans to the lunar surface.The earliest forays into lunar exploration were a product of the ongoing Cold War, when the U.S. and Soviet Union sent uncrewed spacecraft to orbit and land on the moon.The Soviets scored an early victory in January 1959, when Luna 1, a small Soviet sphere bristling with antennas, became the first spacecraft to escape Earth’s gravity and ultimately fly within about 4,000 miles of the moon’s surface. (Read more about early spaceflight.)Later in 1959, Luna 2 became the first spacecraft to make contact with the moon's surface when it crashed in the Mare Imbrium basin near the Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus craters. That same year, a third Luna mission captured the first, blurry images of the far side of the moon—where the rugged highland terrain is markedly different from the smoother basins on the side closest to Earth.Then, the U.S. got in the game with nine NASA Ranger spacecraft that launched between 1961 and 1965, and gave scientists the first close-up views of the moon’s surface. The Ranger missions were daring one-offs, with spacecraft engineered to streak toward the moon and capture as many images as possible before crashing onto its surface. By 1965, images from all the Ranger missions, particularly Ranger 9, had revealed greater detail about the moon’s rough terrain and the potential challenges of finding a smooth landing site for humans.In 1966, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 9 became the first vehicle to land safely on the lunar surface. Stocked with scientific and communications equipment, the small spacecraft photographed a ground-level lunar panorama. Later that year, Luna 10 launched, becoming the first spacecraft to successfully orbit the moon.NASA also landed a spacecraft on the moon’s surface that year with the first of its Surveyor space probes, which carried cameras to explore the moon's surface and soil samplers to analyze lunar rock and dirt. Over the two years that followed, NASA launched five Lunar Orbiter missions that were designed to circle the moon and chart its surface in preparation for the ultimate goal: landing astronauts on the surface. These orbiters photographed about 99 percent of the moon's surface, revealing potential landing sites and paving the way for a giant leap forward in space exploration.(See a map of all lunar landings.)At the time, NASA was racing to fulfill a presidential promise: In 1961, President John F. Kennedy committed the United States to landing a person on the moon before the decade was complete. The Apollo program, by far the most expensive spaceflight endeavor in history, kicked off that year, and by the time it ended in 1972, nine missions and 24 astronauts had orbited or landed on the moon.Perhaps the most famous of those, Apollo 11, marked the first time humans had stepped on another world.On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquility in the lunar lander Eagle, while astronaut Michael Collins orbited the moon in the command module Columbia. Armstrong, who pressed the first bootprints into the moon’s surface, famously said, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” The pair stayed on the moon’s surface for 21 hours and 36 minutes before rendezvousing with Collins and heading back to Earth. (Exploring the legacy of Apollo 11 at the dawn of a new era of space travel.)Each mission after Apollo 11 set new milestones in space travel and lunar exploration. Four months after the first humans reached the moon, Apollo 12 touched down, achieving a much more precise landing on the moon.Apollo 13 narrowly avoided a near-disaster when on-board oxygen tanks exploded in April 1970, forcing the crew to abort a planned moon landing. All three survived.During the third lunar landing, in January 1971, Apollo 14, commander Alan Shepard set a new record for the farthest distance traveled on the moon: 9,000 feet. He even lobbed a few golf balls into a nearby crater with a makeshift 6-iron.Apollo 15, launched in July 1971, was the first of three missions capable of a longer stay on the moon. In the course of three days spent on the lunar surface, achievements included collecting hundreds of pounds of lunar samples and traveling more than 17 miles in the first piloted moon buggy. (The Soviet Union had sent a remotely controlled rover to the moon, Lunokhod 1, in 1970.)Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 in 1972 were the two most recent crewed missions to the moon, and Russia’s Luna-24 crewless spacecraft in 1976 was the last to land until the following century. Samples collected during these lunar explorations produced huge amounts of knowledge about the geology and formation of the Earth’s moon. (See a timeline of the space race and its modern-day version in private spaceflight.)After the dramatic accomplishments of the 1960s and 1970s, the major space agencies turned their attention elsewhere for several decades. So far, only 12 humans—all Americans and all men—have set foot on the moon.It wasn’t until 1994 that the moon came back into focus for the United States, with a joint mission between NASA and the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. The Clementine spacecraft mapped the moon's surface in wavelengths other than visible light, from ultraviolet to infrared. Hiding in the more than 1.8 million digital photos it captured were hints of ice in some of the moon’s craters.In 1999, the Lunar Prospector orbited the moon, confirming Clementine’s discovery of ice at the lunar poles, a resource that could be crucial for any long-term lunar settlement. The mission's end was spectacular: Prospector slammed into the moon, intending to create a plume that could be studied for evidence of water ice but none was observed. (Ten years later, NASA’s LCROSS spacecraft repeated this experiment and found evidence for water in a shadowed region near the moon’s south pole.)Since 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken high-resolution maps of the lunar surface. Between 2011 and 2012, it was joined in orbit by NASA’s twin GRAIL probes—named Ebb and Flow—which mapped the moon’s gravitational field before intentionally crashing into a region near the lunar north pole.NASA isn’t the only space agency with a surging interest in the moon. Within the last two decades, lunar exploration has gone truly international—and even commercial.In 2007, Japan launched its first lunar orbiter, SELENE. China launched its first lunar spacecraft the same year, and India followed suit in 2008. By 2013, China became the third country to successfully land on the lunar surface, when its Chang’e-3 spacecraft deployed the Yutu rover.More milestones—both for better and worse—were achieved in 2019. In January, another Chinese lander, Yutu-2, made history by becoming the first rover to touch down on the lunar farside. Meanwhile, India’s second lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-2, unsuccessfully deployed a small lander, Vikram, on the lunar surface that year. (India’s space agency hopes to try again in 2021.) And in April 2019 Israel aimed for the moon with the launch of its Beresheet spacecraft. Unfortunately, even though the spacecraft achieved lunar orbit, it crashed during its attempt to land.Unlike other spacecraft that came before it, Beresheet was built largely with private funding, heralding a new era of lunar exploration in which private companies are hoping to take the reins from governments.NASA, for one, is partnering with commercial spaceflight companies to develop both robotic and crewed landers for lunar exploration; among those companies are SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Astrobotic. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin have announced the goal of establishing a lunar base near the south pole where people could work and live. SpaceX is developing a spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts to the moon and Mars, and is also developing a plan to bring tourists to lunar orbit. (The future of spaceflight—from orbital vacations to humans on Mars.)And not to be overshadowed by the commercial sector, NASA is planning its own ambitious return to the moon. The agency’s Artemis program, a sister to the venerable Apollo project, aims to put the first woman—and the next man—on the moon by 2024. The backbone of Artemis is NASA’s Orion space capsule, currently in development, although the agency is also partnering with private companies to achieve its goal.If Artemis goes well, then the near future might also see NASA and partners developing a space station in lunar orbit that could serve as a gateway to destinations on the moon’s surface—and beyond.",
"China launched its first lunar probe on Dec. 2, making it only the third nation, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to soft-land on the moon.A dry spell lasting 37 years for “soft” lunar landings ended on Saturday, December 14, with the arrival of China’s lunar rover.Launched December 1, the Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, rover will take pictures, probe the lunar surface, and install two telescopes on the moon.With a successful rocket-assisted soft landing, the 220-pound (100-kilogram) rover will also make China only the third nation, besides the U.S.A. and Russia, to stage a slow landing of a spacecraft on the moon. (See also: “China Shoots for the Moon.”)The last such lunar landing took place with Russia’s Luna 24 mission in 1976, which returned moon rocks to Earth. Apollo 17 in 1972, the most recent manned mission to the moon, was the final U.S. soft lunar landing.Why haven’t Russian or U.S. landers returned to the moon, and why the long wait for this latest lander?“The short answer is that there was no compelling scientific reason to go back to the moon,” says space policy expert John Logsdon, author of John F. Kennedy and His Race to the Moon. “And probably still isn’t.”NASA’s Apollo missions after all returned 842 hundred pounds (382 kilograms) of moon rocks to Earth, some of them still unexamined. They answered questions about the age of the moon, now thought to have arisen from an early collision between the Earth and a Mars-size object roughly 4.5 billion years ago.Those missions also pointed to the moon as an expensive and dangerous place to send people, particularly after the near-fatal Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which spooked U.S. President Richard Nixon, who was already looking for ways to rein in space agency spending after his 1972 re-election, according to Logsdon.China’s Lunar Goals“Firstly, the moon is remote from us, and there is no clear short-term benefit for human beings,” says space scientist Yongchun Zheng of the National Astronomical Observatories in Beijing, by email.But for China, he says, “the lunar exploration program is driven by its science goals. That is, to understand the history and prospect the future of the Moon, the Earth, and our solar system.”In a 2008 report in the Planetary and Space Science journal, Zheng and colleagues also noted that “lunar exploration may promote the innovation and development of series of basic and applied science” for China.“The implementation of China’s Lunar Exploration Program can drive forward the popularization, improve accomplishment of national science, and attract and encourage the youth to fall in love with science and seek after exploration and innovation,” they wrote.On a more down-to-earth level, “China’s space program provides several key benefits to the nation,” space policy analyst Patrick Besha wrote in a 2010 Space Policy report on China’s lunar program. Primarily, he wrote, “it expands the high-technology sector and helps to integrate key military and technology industries.”Legend of Chang'e Flying to the MoonIn Chinese legend, Chang'e was a beautiful woman who swallowed an elixir of immortality and found herself becoming lighter and lighter.“She flew up in spite of herself, drifting and floating in the air, until she reached the palace of the moon,” according to the Planetary and Space Science report. “Once on the moon, Chang'e became a three-legged toad, as punishment,” it notes.Despite the unhappy ending, the legend of the moon goddess still serves as inspiration for China, according to the report.China’s rover landing is the culmination of a lunar program initiated more than a decade ago, which has seen two previous spacecraft successfully enter lunar orbit, one in 2007 and one in 2010.Over the past decade, China’s space program has also launched “taikonauts” to an orbiting space lab, re-creating space technology steps undertaken by the U.S. and Russian space agencies four decades ago.“The logical culmination of these efforts would be a well-deliberated attempt to land people on the moon at some point,” says former NASA official Scott Pace of the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.The New Moon RaceChina’s lunar rover comes after a decade of renewed attention paid to the moon by the world’s space agencies. The arrival of the U.S. Air Force/NASA Clementine mission to the moon in 1994 sparked much of the recent interest in the lunar surface after it reported signs of water frozen there in a radar experiment.In 2010, NASA’s LCROSS mission showed by means of two “hard” landings—deliberate impacts of the spacecraft and a companion rocket that threw up a plume of dust—that the moon hid frozen water deep in the permanently  shaded craters on its south pole.The finding has figured in debates over the next step for the U.S. manned space program, with a U.S.-Canadian moon rover called RESOLVE considered as a lunar water prospector for future missions. Some space entrepreneurs, such as Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace, have called for awarding mineral rights to spur moon colonies. (See also: “Moon Mining Rush Ahead.”)There are also more than a dozen private teams competing for the $40 million Google Lunar XPRIZE, which will be awarded for landing a rover and driving it “above, below, or on the Lunar surface” some 1,640 feet (500 meters) by 2015.China’s Jade Rabbit rover looks set to beat the Lunar XPRIZE teams, at least, with its landing.“The moon is a challenging goal for rising space powers and private-sector players but a reachable goal, so it’s the logical next step beyond low Earth orbit," Pace says.“Orbiting the moon is much easier than executing a soft landing, much less controlling a rover on the surface,” he adds, which goes a long way toward explaining why we have had to wait so long for this latest lunar rover.Follow Dan Vergano on Twitter and Google+.",
"Moments before crashing on the moon's surface, SpaceIL's Beresheet lander took this picture of its descent. If successful, the Israeli spacecraft would have been the world's first privately funded lunar lander.On April 11, an Israeli lander named after the Hebrew word for “Genesis” attempted to mark a new beginning for space exploration by becoming the first privately funded spacecraft to touch down on the moon. Built by the Israeli nonprofit SpaceIL, the Beresheet lander tried to softly land within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the moon's northern near side—but as it made its descent, the spacecraft's main engine failed. Engineers reset the spacecraft but lost communications, and the 330-pound lander ultimately crashed.On April 12, SpaceIL released preliminary data from the last few moments of the mission, which show that despite resetting Beresheet, the spacecraft was descending at more than 300 miles an hour while it was less than 500 feet from touchdown, leading to “the inevitable collision with the lunar surface.”“We didn’t make it, but we definitely tried, and I think the achievement of getting to where we got is pretty tremendous,” Morris Kahn, SpaceIL's primary funder and president, said during a livestream of the attempt. “I think we can be proud ... you win some, you lose some.”A successful touchdown would have made Israel the fourth country to pull off a soft lunar landing, and SpaceIL would have become the first entity primarily funded by private donors to land a spacecraft on another world. The lander was carrying two scientific instruments and a digital time capsule that included a “lunar library.”Despite the hard landing, the mission is a milestone: Beresheet is the closest a private entity has come so far to landing on the lunar surface. And on April 4, the spacecraft successfully entered orbit around the moon—making Israel just the seventh country ever to accomplish that feat.“Compared to not doing the mission at all, it [is] still an advancement, because it proves that they got that far,” says Phil Metzger, a planetary scientist at the University of Central Florida. “You can say they hit the moon, they didn't get hopelessly lost among the stars—that's amazing! That means they did 99 percent of their mission.”Beresheet's landing attempt now concludes more than eight years of work. SpaceIL got its start in late 2010, when three students—Yariv Bash, Kfir Damari, and Yonatan Winetraub—met one night for drinks at a bar outside of Tel Aviv and convinced themselves they could build a moon-bound spacecraft. They promptly entered the Google Lunar XPrize, a global contest founded in 2007 that pledged $20 million to the first private entity to land a spacecraft on the moon. (Find out more about the Google Lunar XPrize in National Geographic magazine.)“It’s been quite crazy, I never thought it would be this big,” Bash says. “I've been getting pictures of kids getting dressed up like astronauts—it's really exciting to see how it unfolded.”Want to know more about the mission, its origins, and its significance? We've got you covered.On April 4, 2019, Beresheet entered orbit around the moon, taking this picture of the moon's far side from an altitude of 292 miles.From more than 225,000 miles away, Earth appears as just a bright dot in the background in this image taken by Beresheet.Initially, the SpaceIL team dreamed of landing a spacecraft on the moon by the end of 2012, with a lander weighing no more than a few pounds. But when briefed on the nonprofit's plans, the Israel Space Agency and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), the country's primary defense contractor, cautioned SpaceIL that its plans were only half-baked.“Most of them thought we were a joke for the first few years,” Bash says.Instead of turning their backs on the fledgling group, however, Israel's more experienced space entities chipped in. IAI agreed to build the spacecraft, and the Israel Space Agency agreed to provide technical support and $2 million. In the meantime, SpaceIL raised the vast majority of its $90 to $100-million budget from private donations. Much of the funding came from SpaceIL's Kahn, an Israeli-South African software entrepreneur, and the Adelson Family Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit founded by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.SpaceIL ended up becoming one of the Google Lunar XPrize's finalists, and in 2015, it became the first competitor to book its flight to space. “That was really fun to see: to see a business being built around this, in space, in Israel, inspiring the public and the next generation of kids,” says Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, a vice president at the XPrize Foundation and the former director of the Google Lunar XPrize.But like many of the prize's competitors, SpaceIL confronted budget shortfalls and technical delays. After extending the deadline several times, Google and the XPrize Foundation ended the Lunar XPrize in March 2018 without crowning a winner.Despite the contest's end, SpaceIL persevered. On February 22, 2019, the spacecraft launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, riding alongside an Indonesian communications satellite. SpaceIL hitched a ride with the help of Spaceflight Industries, which brokered the nonprofit's piggybacking. In the weeks since launch, Beresheet traveled more than four million miles, completing a series of three widening orbits around Earth that took it ever closer to the moon.At SpaceIL’s facility near Tel Aviv, a thermal vacuum chamber creates the same intense heat the lander will encounter during the moon’s daytime, which is equivalent to continuous sunlight for 14 Earth days.“This is a paradigm shift that's kind of hard to appreciate ... This is the first privately funded, voluntarily funded lunar mission, and it's the first mission that's really kind of doing something different,” says Ryan Olcott, the Spaceflight Industries mission manager who worked with SpaceIL.Even with the Lunar XPrize off the table, the nonprofit will receive another recognition: a $1-million “Moonshot Award” from the XPrize Foundation to celebrate former competitor's perseverance. In a statement posted on Twitter, XPrize founder Peter Diamandis confirmed that this award would be given to SpaceIL despite the crash.“It goes back to being proud of all the work that SpaceIL has done,” says Gonzales-Mowrer on creating the Moonshot Award. “We want to celebrate the achievements, and the fact that they're daring to dream.”Now that SpaceIL has made its landing attempt, the organization is set to “self destruct”; the nonprofit's existence had been centered on Beresheet alone. Bash says that the group will decide on its long-term plans in the coming weeks. In the meantime, IAI has teamed up with the German firm OHB to offer the European Space Agency rides for its moon-bound instruments.While SpaceIL is the first private entity to get this far with a moon landing, it certainly won't be the last, and those that follow will have a far more commercial bent. As interest grows in moving industry—maybe even people—off world, many new companies, including some former Lunar XPrize competitors, are angling to become the pillars of a new lunar economy.“It's ridiculously hard, but it's getting more reasonable to aspire to,” says Bob Richards, CEO of Moon Express, a former finalist in the Google Lunar XPrize. “It'll be transformational. I see the democratization of access to the moon and deep space happening now, in the same way that CubeSats have democratized access to low-Earth orbit.”NASA is helping fan the industry's flames, just as it did when it offered contracts to private companies to send supplies, and eventually astronauts, to the International Space Station. In April 2018, it announced the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, offering contracts to private companies to take NASA scientific instruments to the moon. In November 2018, NASA approved nine bidders, including former Lunar XPrize competitors Moon Express and Astrobotic, to compete for the agency's contracts. Barbara Cohen, a planetary scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, says that the program will provide a welcome return to the lunar surface for U.S. science after a four-decade absence.After three failed launches, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk scraped together enough funding to launch a fourth version of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket. On September 28, 2008, Musk's gamble paid off when the Falcon 1 became the first privately developed liquid-fuel rocket to orbit Earth. The rocket is seen here lifting off from the Reagan Test Site in the Marshall Islands.“Orbital measurements are awesome, we're really happy with our orbital campaign, not just with LRO [the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter] but with GRAIL and LADEE and ARTEMIS, and a whole suite of spacecraft—but we have a lot of unanswered questions that we need lunar access to address,” she says.In the coming months, India is expected to launch its Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, which aims to be the first ever to land near the moon's south pole. And on the heels of Chang'e-4, the first spacecraft to land successfully on the moon's far side, China is making plans for its Chang'e-5 mission, which, if successful, would be the first mission since Apollo 17 to return samples from the lunar surface. At the same time, the Trump Administration is trying to rally support for a 2024 human mission to the moon, even as other space agencies sketch out plans for their own crewed lunar missions.“Nations are seeing space as an area in which national prowess can be demonstrated,” says Joanne Gabrynowicz, an emerita professor at the University of Mississippi and an expert on space law.As space becomes more international, will the cosmos become a free-for-all? Going back to the 1960s, spacefaring nations signed onto a series of treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, that set some ground rules, such as banning nuclear weapons. Language in the treaty says that countries are responsible for the space activities of their companies and citizens—but the specifics of such supervision are left to each country to implement.Still, amid all the questions raised by this latest leap for the future of spaceflight, Bash is simply reflecting on how the group he founded made history—and nearly touched down on our close cosmic companion.“It's one of those once-in-a-lifetime adventures,” he says.",
"Welcome to the 21st-century space race, one that could potentially lead to 10-minute space vacations, orbiting space hotels, and humans on Mars. Now, instead of warring superpowers battling for dominance in orbit, private companies are competing to make space travel easier and more affordable. This year, SpaceX achieved a major milestone—launching humans to the International Space Station (ISS) from the United States—but additional goalposts are on the star-studded horizon.Private spaceflight is not a new concept. In the United States, commercial companies played a role in the aerospace industry right from the start: Since the 1960s, NASA has relied on private contractors to build spacecraft for every major human spaceflight program, starting with Project Mercury and continuing until the present.Today, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is expanding on the agency’s relationship with private companies. Through it, NASA is relying on SpaceX and Boeing to build spacecraft capable of carrying humans into orbit. Once those vehicles are built, both companies retain ownership and control of the craft, and NASA can send astronauts into space for a fraction of the cost of a seat on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft.SpaceX, which established a new paradigm by developing reusable rockets, has been running regular cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station since 2012. And in May 2020, the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the ISS, becoming the first crewed mission to launch from the United States in nearly a decade. The mission, called Demo-2, is scheduled to return to Earth in August. Boeing is currently developing its Starliner spacecraft and hopes to begin carrying astronauts to the ISS in 2021.Other companies, such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, are specializing in sub-orbital space tourism. Test launch video from inside the cabin of Blue Origin’s New Shepard shows off breathtaking views of our planet and a relatively calm journey for its first passenger, a test dummy cleverly dubbed “Mannequin Skywalker.” Virgin Galactic is running test flights on its sub-orbital spaceplane, which will offer paying customers roughly six minutes of weightlessness during its journey through Earth’s atmosphere.With these and other spacecraft in the pipeline, countless dreams of zero-gravity somersaults could soon become a reality—at least for passengers able to pay the hefty sums for the experience.Apollo 1 astronauts "Gus" Grissom (left), Edward White, and Roger Chaffee pose in front of the Saturn 1 launch vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. On the morning of January 27, 1967, the crew was sitting atop the launch pad for a pre-launch test when a fire broke out in their capsule, killing all three astronauts. The investigation into the fatal accident led to major design changes for future launch vehicles.Moon missions are essential to the exploration of more distant worlds. After a long hiatus from the lunar neighborhood, NASA is again setting its sights on Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor with an ambitious plan to place a space station in lunar orbit sometime in the next decade. Sooner, though, the agency’s Artemis program, a sister to the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, is aiming to put the first woman (and the next man) on the lunar surface by 2024.Extended lunar stays build the experience and expertise needed for the long-term space missions required to visit other planets. As well, the moon may also be used as a forward base of operations from which humans learn how to replenish essential supplies, such as rocket fuel and oxygen, by creating them from local material.Such skills are crucial for the future expansion of human presence into deeper space, which demands more independence from Earth-based resources. And although humans have visited the moon before, the cratered sphere still harbors its own scientific mysteries to be explored—including the presence and extent of water ice near the moon's south pole, which is one of the top target destinations for space exploration.NASA is also enlisting the private sector to help it reach the moon. It has awarded three contracts to private companies working on developing human-rated lunar landers—including both Blue Origin and SpaceX. But the backbone of the Artemis program relies on a brand new, state-of-the-art spacecraft called Orion.Aeronaut John Steiner inflates his hot air balloon at Erie, Pennsylvania, as seen in the oldest known photograph of an aircraft, a quarter-plate ambrotype taken in June 1857.Get more aeronautics photos and facts in the National Geographic book National Air and Space Museum: An Autobiography >>Currently being built and tested, Orion—like Crew Dragon and Starliner—is a space capsule similar to the spacecraft of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, as well as Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. But the Orion capsule is larger and can accommodate a four-person crew. And even though it has a somewhat retro design, the capsule concept is considered to be safer and more reliable than NASA’s space shuttle—a revolutionary vehicle for its time, but one that couldn’t fly beyond Earth’s orbit and suffered catastrophic failures.Capsules, on the other hand, offer launch-abort capabilities that can protect astronauts in case of a rocket malfunction. And, their weight and design mean they can also travel beyond Earth’s immediate neighborhood, potentially ferrying humans to the moon, Mars, and beyond.By moving into orbit with its Commercial Crew Program and partnering with private companies to reach the lunar surface, NASA hopes to change the economics of spaceflight by increasing competition and driving down costs. If space travel truly does become cheaper and more accessible, it’s possible that private citizens will routinely visit space and gaze upon our blue, watery home world—either from space capsules, space stations, or even space hotels like the inflatable habitats Bigelow Aerospace intends to build.The United States isn’t the only country with its eyes on the sky. Russia regularly launches humans to the International Space Station aboard its Soyuz spacecraft. China is planning a large, multi-module space station capable of housing three taikonauts, and has already launched two orbiting test vehicles—Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2, both of which safely burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere after several years in space.Now, more than a dozen countries have the ability to launch rockets into Earth orbit. A half-dozen space agencies have designed spacecraft that shed the shackles of Earth’s gravity and traveled to the moon or Mars. And if all goes well, the United Arab Emirates will join that list in the summer of 2020 when its Hope spacecraft heads to the red planet. While there are no plans yet to send humans to Mars, these missions—and the discoveries that will come out of them—may help pave the way.",
"A previously used SpaceX booster takes off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on March 30 in the world's first successful flight of a reused rocket.One rocket (first stage), gently used. Minimal mileage, moderate lift capacity, best used for delivery of goods to Earth-orbit. 100% success rate! Price ~$62 million, OBO given pre-flown condition (though we prefer to think of this as “flight proven”).In a milestone for the private spaceflight company, SpaceX today successfully launched a reused Falcon 9 rocket booster into space—the same first stage that carried a bouncy house into space last year.The rocket booster had previously stuck a spectacular landing on a drone ship floating off the Florida coast, playfully named “Of Course I Still Love You.”That reused booster stuck its landing again on Thursday, and on the same drone ship no less, after blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This time, the rocket wasn’t carrying an inflatable space pod, but was instead delivering a communications satellite to orbit for a company called SES.The rocket’s vertical touchdown marks the ninth successful SpaceX landing in 14 tries, six of which have been on ships floating offshore.Last April, SpaceX launched an inflatable habitat to the International Space Station—and then successfully turned the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket around, flew it back to Earth, and parked it on a drone ship floating 185 miles off the U.S. East Coast.“The rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship, or tipping over, so we’re really excited about that,” said SpaceX founder Elon Musk at a press conference after the landing.After launching from Cape Canaveral, the SpaceX rocket boosted its payload-carrying Dragon capsule toward low-Earth orbit, then turned around and headed for home about 4.5 minutes after launch. As it approached the drone ship, the Falcon 9 righted itself, slowed down, and landed perfectly.“The 1st stage of the Falcon 9 just landed on our ‘Of Course I Still Love You’ droneship. Dragon in good orbit,” Space X tweeted, in what must be the most understated announcement of the successful landing to cross our feed.To space and back, in less than nine minutes? Hello, future.In 2015, the company successfully set a rocket back down on the ground, but landing at sea is much trickier than landing on … land … because the ocean is a moving beast. Previous attempts failed when earlier rockets toppled over and experienced a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” (i.e., they exploded).Musk said that before that April launch, company members were placing the odds of success at 2:1. “We thought it was more likely than not that this mission would work, but still probably have a 1/3 chance of failure,” Musk said. “It’s still quite tricky to land on a ship … it’s quite a tiny target.”The name of the game here is making spaceflight cheaper by developing reusable rockets that can ferry people and cargo into orbit, instead of spending millions of dollars building new launch rockets. Blue Origin, a company owned by Jeff Bezos, is also working on reusable rocket systems, and has successfully landed its New Shepard rocket on the ground multiple times.Musk and his team hope that once reusable rockets become more than a mere curiosity, they’ll help reduce the often prohibitive costs of space travel, which is crucial for Musk’s ambitious plan to populate Mars within a few decades.His next goals include two successful launches of the same booster within 24 hours.",
"Beth Moses (center) floats in microgravity on board a Virgin Galactic flight on February 22.Late last week, commercial spaceflight company Virgin Galactic sent three people to space and back, including Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor. It was the first time that Moses, an aerospace engineer who has previously worked at NASA, had visited space—and the flight makes her the first woman to fly this high on a commercial spacecraft.Now, Moses’s job is to prepare Virgin Galactic’s customers for what could be the experience of a lifetime: A journey above the atmosphere and into microgravity, where the sky is dark and Earth’s horizon is curved. Tickets are selling for US $250,000 each, and so far, 600 people from 58 countries are waiting for their turn to ride.Everyone who signs up must pass a basic medical exam, but unlike NASA’s highly selective astronaut program, there is no “right stuff” that commercial fliers must possess—just a lot of cash, a bit of fearlessness, and a sense of adventure.The company isn’t quite ready to begin commercial operations yet, as there are more test flights to be completed, but Moses says it feels like that day is “tantalizingly close.” She talked with us about preparing future astronauts for flight and what she hopes will change when space (however you define it) becomes more widely accessible.Virgin Galactic's craft, SpaceShipTwo, reached an altitude of just over 55 miles on February 22.According to the U.S. Air Force definition of the boundary, the three passengers on this latest flight reached space.My role is to prepare any astronaut that flies in our customer cabin for their space flight, and to make sure that they’re ready for it and enjoy it in whatever ways they most want to enjoy it.My main aim is to make sure that folks arrive in space without any element of concern or surprise—you know what to expect, you’re prepared for it. I don’t want someone to arrive in space and spend the first bit of their time wondering what those noises were, or wondering which way is North on the Earth, or wondering if what they’re seeing outside the window is normal or if the flight is going the way it should. I just want people to arrive in space having the time of their lives and being able to savor whatever it is that they want to get out of it.To that end, the training is a three-day program, nominally, and the first day is about you—your suit, your gear, communication, getting you ready, including some preparation for g-forces. The second day is about the cabin, your fellow fliers, where the views are, and you sort of meld into a crew of passengers. And then the third day is sort of cementing it, rehearsing it, and understanding the broader operation.The fourth day is spaceflight.That’s an excellent question, and it’s one that I’ve been asking all of our astronauts as I meet them. There are some people who astutely say, Well I don’t know, I’d like you to help prepare me for what I should get out of it and what’s not to miss.But then there are others who have definite ideas ... there are folks who are looking forward to the rocket ride and boost, folks who cannot wait for weightlessness, there are people who have very personal, introspective ambitions. For some people, this is the ambition of a lifetime, for some people it borders on spiritual, and then there are those—a good, solid majority—who are just dying for the view.It was magnificent. It was indescribable. It’s an amazing, amazing, sort of mildly intense, wonderful experience. Our customers are very, very lucky individuals. I was flying as a professional member of the flight crew, I had jobs to do the whole flight, but even in that environment, I found it incredibly magical.Of course I’d love to go again, but I’d also like to send everyone I know and every human to space. Our aim is to open space broadly, open space to change the world and in all honesty, even though I loved it, I want to make sure that as many people fly as possible.It absolutely is. I look at pictures from space totally differently now, because pictures don’t do it complete justice. I definitely was aware that Earth was a precious and beautiful thing, far below me, and you’re definitely aware of the majesty of the planet.Virgin Galactic reaches space by first sending the SpaceShipTwo vehicle into the air attached to a carrier plane, called White Knight Two. The spacecraft then detaches and fires its rocket engine to complete the climb.I feel really fortunate to have flown on the exact day that I flew, because the southwestern United States was perfectly clear of clouds, beautifully sparkling with snow-capped mountains, beautifully lush and green from recent weather. That’s the thing that stands out to me in terms of the view: It was so sharp from space, I can’t even describe it.It’s so black. It’s so deeply black, it’s blacker than any black I’ve seen. Forget vantablack [the darkest material yet made]. It’s so deeply black that it makes the Earth so sharp and bright.We will have to look into how to do that. Projectiles don’t go with spacecraft, and liquids don’t go with avionics, but, never say never!",
"An illustration shows the New Glenn rocket, Blue Origin's orbital vehicle.Blue Origin—the private spaceflight company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos—announced today that it intends to send its new Blue Moon lander to the lunar south pole. During an invitation-only event in Washington, D.C., Bezos revealed that the company is targeting Shackleton crater, a 13-mile-wide splotch parked at the moon's south pole that is rich in water ice and surrounded by patches of near-perpetual sunlight.Rumors of Blue Origin's lunar designs took off on April 26, when the company issued a cryptic tweet giving today's date, paired with an image of explorer Ernest Shackleton’s ship the Endurance, part of his troubled 1914 journey across Antarctica.But the company had quietly been laying a groundwork for months. Since last fall, Blue Origin has advertised jobs in lunar lander design, filed a request to trademark the term “Blue Moon”, and announced that it is co-sponsoring a moon race along the lines of the former Google Lunar Xprize. The company even features the moon in its coat of arms.“It’s time for America to return to the moon—this time to stay,” Bretton Alexander, Blue Origin’s director of business development and strategy, testified to Congress in 2017. “Shackleton crater, and other locations like it, offer a realistic proving ground for testing of critical deep space exploration technologies in close proximity to Earth.”With this announcement, Blue Origin joins a fleet of space agencies and other private groups with their sights set on the lunar south pole. But why this region in particular, and what does the race mean for potential human missions? We’ve got you covered.For starters, the south pole is marred by one of the largest known impact craters in the solar system. Called the South Pole-Aitken Basin, it’s a mammoth blemish that scientists would love to get a better look at.The mosaic image from the Lunar Reconnaissance Oribter shows the dark depths of shadowed craters on the moon's south pole.Thought to be ancient, the basin spans 1,600 miles and is roughly eight miles deep. It contains numerous smaller (but still relatively large) craters, such as Apollo, Schrödinger, Shackleton, and Von Kármán, a crater on the lunar far side where China’s Chang’e-4 spacecraft set down in January.“There’s been a lot of interest in going to the south pole of the moon,” says Noah Petro of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. “We just haven’t had the opportunity to do it.”Aside from the value of examining that giant basin up-close, the south pole boasts several crucial resources for those intending to establish a more permanent presence on the moon. Chief among them are water, in the form of ice, and sunlight, for solar power.“Ultimately, the moon will provide a proving ground to test our technologies and resources that will take us to Mars and beyond, including building a sustainable, reusable architecture,” says Sarah Noble, lead lunar scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.For a long time, scientists suspected that the moon held onto some water, perhaps as a consequence of early volcanism or impactors from the outer solar system. But it wasn’t until relatively recently that they began to pinpoint just how much water might be there—and where to find it.In 2009, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, went into orbit around the moon’s poles; the spacecraft then slammed its spent rocket booster into Cabeus crater, near the south pole. The impact slung debris into space, which the spacecraft descended through and studied before also hitting the moon (“I like to call it lithobraking—a hard landing,” Petro says).In that busted up moonstuff, LCROSS found water. That, says Brown University’s Ariel Deutsch, is perhaps the strongest direct evidence for the presence of water on or near the moon’s surface, although of course, the spacecraft could only study one lunar region.But Deutsch, who studies the distribution of ices on planetary surfaces, also points to more recent data as strong evidence for water on the moon, this time collected using a NASA instrument aboard the Indian Space Research Organization’s moon-orbiting Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft.A model of Chandrayaan-1 sits on display during a press conference at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on October 22, 2008, after the successful launch of the actual spacecraft, India's first lunar probe.Announced last year, those observations reveal the presence of exposed water ice on the moon’s surface. Its distribution and depth are not well understood, but the ice appears to be sparsely scattered throughout the walls and floors of permanently shadowed regions at both lunar poles.At the south pole, most of those icy deposits are inside the dark recesses of craters, including Shackleton, where the temperature never rises above -250 degrees Fahrenheit. The University of Hawaii’s Shuai Li, who spearheaded the report, says the ice is most likely mixed in with surface soils, rather than being solid slabs you could skate on, and that there could be between 10 thousand and a hundred million tons of it at the south pole alone.“We do not know how deep the deposits are,” Li says. “We need rovers or landers to be there to do the in situ detections, to tell the ice layer thickness, their origins, their ages, and their more accurate abundance.”Water is, of course, essential for human life as we know it, and extracting moon water is astronomically simpler and cheaper than hauling the stuff over from Earth. So, reliably supplying a moon base with life-supporting liquid would be among the first steps in establishing any kind of lingering lunar presence.Secondly, water can be used to make rocket fuel. Doing that would mean setting up the necessary equipment to cleave the two hydrogen atoms from each water molecule’s oxygen atom—both of which, when separated, are fuel components.But not all south polar destinations are created equal, and it’s possible Shackleton crater isn’t even the greatest. Li suggests that Sverdrup, Haworth, Shoemaker, and Faustini craters might have the most abundant ice deposits, a conclusion that is mirrored by work from Arizona State University’s Mark Robinson, who runs the camera aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.Recently, Robinson and his colleagues decided to rank some of the south polar craters in terms of their richness in potential resources, including water ice. The crew took a look at volatiles, compounds that easily transform into vapors or gases, and compiled data on the distribution of those volatiles across the south pole. They ranked various craters in terms of size and potential resources, and emerged with a clear winner: Shoemaker crater, followed by Haworth and Faustini.“But of course we need to get down and get some regolith under our fingernails!” Robinson says, referring to the top layers of lunar soil. “Shackleton is certainly a pretty good place to prospect. But it is inherently smaller than Shoemaker, so chances are Shoemaker could hold more ice.”The lunar south pole also boasts some of the rare places on the moon’s surface that are almost perpetually bathed in sunlight. Although recent data confirmed that true “peaks of eternal light” don’t exist even at the lunar poles, the massive lowland basin at the south pole does host some thin crests, peaks, and crater rims that see sunlight for as many as 200 lunar days at a time.Parachutes bring Blue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule to a safe landing after an uncrewed test flight in July 2018.“This has a variety of positive impacts on exploration architectures, including a benign thermal environment, and the ability to leverage solar power systems to facilitate surface presence,” says Sam Lawrence, lead scientist for lunar exploration at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. “All in all, the polar environment makes surviving the lunar night a very tractable engineering problem.”Rather conveniently, a few of these areas are right next door to the permanently shadowed craters—including near Shackleton—meaning that humans looking to set up a moon base might want to seek this somewhat paradoxic mixture of eternal light and dark.Harvesting the available resources, though, raises some questions.If Blue Origin does land near the lunar south pole, could the company legally begin to mine the moon’s resources? Yes. But would it—or could it—actually own those lunar resources? Maybe.In 1967, beset by rising tensions during the height of the space race, countries across the globe agreed on a set of rules governing the exploration and use of space. Just over a hundred countries, including the United States and the former U.S.S.R., have now signed the Outer Space Treaty, which says that space is to be free for exploration and use by all, but only for peaceful purposes.As well, the treaty prohibits any nation from appropriating celestial territory “by means of use or occupation, or by any other means”—meaning that no patch of the moon (or Mars, or anywhere off Earth), can be considered sovereign property, ever.So, Blue Origin can send a lander to the lunar surface, and it can even begin to extract water ice—there is nothing under U.S. law prohibiting the company from doing that. But the rules are less clear when it comes to determining whether Blue Origin would own the resources it extracts.“The U.S. view has been that private ownership of ‘real estate,’ either on or below the surface of the moon, is not permitted. However, the U.S. interpreted the treaty to permit ownership of the natural resources after they’ve been extracted,” says Georgetown Law School’s Steve Mirmina, an expert in space law. “Sometimes people make an analogy to the Law of the Seas—no one can own the high seas, but if you go and you take fish out of the high seas, you can own those fish, you can eat them, you can sell them.”Furthermore, the United States passed a law in 2015 allowing private citizens to own, sell, and transfer any non-living resources they extract from outer space and celestial bodies, ostensibly to set up the legal and economic machinery for asteroid mining, which has not yet come to fruition.But not everyone agrees with the United States’ viewpoint, specifically because the Outer Space Treaty prohibits national appropriation of space.“Parties to the treaty have an obligation to flow down the treaty provisions to their citizens,” Mirmina says, laying out the counterargument. “So if national appropriation is forbidden, which means the U.S. can’t appropriate outer space, then how could the U.S. allow its citizens to appropriate outer space? How could the citizens of the country do something that the country itself couldn’t do?”In other words, it’s the rule of nemo dat quod non habet—"you cannot give what you do not own”—meaning that if the U.S. is not allowed to own outer space, then the country should not be able to give its citizens that right.As Blue Origin and others hasten humanity’s return to the moon, these are the kinds of questions that are going to bedevil the space law community, says Michelle Hanlon of the University of Mississippi, another expert in space law.“I’m all for exploration and utilization, and if you are a Jeff Bezos-type and you are going to invest billions of dollars in it, then I think you ought to be able to mine it,” she says. “But it needs some sort of management, and that’s what we’re struggling with now.”",
"Blue Origin's New Shepherd rocket clears its launch tower during a test flight in January.Nearly 50 years after Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins completed the first human voyage to set foot on another world, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his spaceflight company Blue Origin have announced a new vision: going back to the moon, this time to stay.At an invitation-only presentation today at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Bezos argued that to sustainably offer humankind the chance for growth, heavy industry has to move off the surface of Earth and rely on resources from the rest of the solar system, such as the minerals and water ice in the lunar south pole's Shackleton crater. (Here's why many space agencies and private groups are looking to visit the moon's south pole.)“We get to preserve this unique gem of a planet ... There is no Plan B,” Bezos says. “We have to save this planet, and we shouldn't give up a future for our grandchildren's grandchildren of dynamism and growth. We can have both.”In the short-term, Bezos says companies need to build the necessary space infrastructure, so Blue Origin is working on a robotic lunar lander called Blue Moon—as he revealed onstage, dropping a black curtain to reveal a full-size mockup of the lander.According to Bezos, Blue Moon is propelled by liquid hydrogen and can precisely land up to 6.5 metric tons of cargo on the moon's surface in its largest configuration. A naval-inspired cargo system will let the lander deliver up to four rovers at once. The company has already signed deals with groups including MIT, the German aerospace firm OHB, and Airbus to develop the project.Bezos and Blue Origin have not specified when Blue Moon will first take flight. Its launch vehicle, the company's New Glenn rocket, is slated for its first flights in 2021. But Bezos says that the lander's extended version could help take astronauts back to the moon by 2024, which is NASA's current stand goal.“I love this; this is the right thing to do,” Bezos says. “We can help meet that time line, but only because we started three years ago.”The company is hardly the only group bent on exploring—or exploiting—the lunar surface. Here are some of the biggest players looking to make their own moon shot in the coming years.NASA made history with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar landings, and it is now working toward a return to the lunar surface. In late 2018, the agency approved nine businesses to bid on contracts for sending NASA instruments to the moon. NASA is also leading global calls for a deep-space outpost in lunar orbit called the Gateway. At the same time, the Trump Administration is advocating for a crewed landing near the lunar south pole by the end of 2024, a plan that faces a steep uphill climb amid budgetary concerns.The China National Space Administration (CNSA) is more than a decade into its ambitious Lunar Exploration Program, a phased strategy of putting robots—and eventually humans—on the moon's surface. In 2018, its Chang'e-4 lander became the first spacecraft to land successfully on the lunar far side. Its next mission, Chang'e-5, aims to become the first in more than 40 years to return samples from the moon. And on April 24, CNSA head Zhang Kejian announced that China would build a scientific research station on the moon's south pole in the next 10 years.The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched its first deep-space mission, Chandrayaan-1, toward the moon in October 2008. The lunar orbiter provided crucial evidence of water's presence in lunar minerals. Now, ISRO is aiming to launch its Chandrayaan-2 mission—an orbiter combined with a lander and rover—in July 2019, with a scheduled landing attempt on September 6. If successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the first mission to softly land in the moon's highest latitudes.Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and its Soviet predecessors were the first to land softly on the lunar surface in 1966, but the country hasn't been back to the moon since 1976. Despite budget woes and a recent track record of delays and cancellations, Roscosmos is talking a big lunar game. The agency has several robotic landers planned for the 2020s. And in January, agency head Dmitry Rogozin announced Russia's intent to build a new “superheavy” rocket named Yenisei by 2028. The proposed rocket is so large, it is probably being designed with the moon in mind.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been to the moon twice: in 1990, with its Hiten probe, and in 2007, with the Kaguya (SELENE) lunar orbiter. Launching no earlier than 2020, its SLIM mission aims to test new landing technologies and touch down within just 330 feet of its intended target, an as-yet undetermined spot near one of the moon's poles. The agency is also considering a “Resource Prospector” mission to a lunar pole that would launch in the 2020s.The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) is gearing up for its first lunar mission, the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO). The satellite will carry several instruments, including a highly sensitive “ShadowCam” built by NASA. SpaceX is slated to launch the orbiter no earlier than the end of 2020.In 2016, European Space Agency director general Jan Woerner publicly endorsed the concept of a “Moon Village”: a diverse global group of lunar explorers, public and private, that agree to coordination mechanisms and common standards. ESA and other partners in the International Space Station, including the Canadian Space Agency, Roscosmos, and JAXA, have declared their support for the lunar Gateway concept being championed by NASA. And by the end of 2019, ESA probably will have a finalized plan for future robotic lunar missions.The private space company has long set its sights on Mars, but the moon is also on its to-do list. No earlier than 2023, The dearMoon project—founded and funded by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa—says it will place an international group of artists aboard SpaceX's Starship rocket and send them on a six-day lunar flyby.Former Google Lunar XPrize finalists and other startups are making moves in the moon's direction, too. In February 2019, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Beresheet, the near-successful lunar lander built by the Israeli nonprofit SpaceIL, which is now preparing to build Beresheet 2.0. The private U.S. company Moon Express is targeting the lunar south pole's well-lit "peaks of eternal light" for its landing sites. And German startup PTScientists—which has teamed up with Audi and Vodafone to build lunar landers and rovers—announced on May 8 that it has entered a long-term agreement with European aerospace firm ArianeGroup, which builds the Ariane rockets frequently used by the European Space Agency. The firms' pact has ESA's blessing.",
"A bright white point of light on the left edge of the moon shows the moment a meteor hit during a "blood moon" eclipse. NASA data now suggest that such impacts release a surprising amount of water from the lunar surface.The moon’s magnificent desolation is far wetter than scientists imagined. A NASA spacecraft sent to study lunar dust and atmosphere also picked up signs of water being released from the moon as meteors collide with its surface. This unprecedented detection, reported today in the journal Nature Geoscience, shows that tiny impacts release up to 220 tons of water a year—much more than should be on the surface based on previously known delivery systems.“There was so much that the instrument on the spacecraft acted like a sponge, soaking up the water that was moving through the atmosphere,” says study leader Mehdi Benna, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “When we turned the instrument on, what we found was extremely exciting.”The discovery offers fresh clues to our understanding of how the moon formed in the first place, and it provides tantalizing targets for future human missions, which could one day use the moon’s watery bounty for both hydration and propulsion.“We always think of the moon as a very peaceful and desolate place,” Benna says. “And now with this data, we see that the moon is actually very active and responsive.”We’ve long known that there is some amount of water on the moon, most of it locked up as ice in permanently shadowed craters or hidden deep below the surface. Water can be delivered to the moon in two ways. Hydrogen from the solar wind can mix with oxygen on the surface and make a chemical relative called hydroxyl, which in turn interacts with lunar rocks to create hydrated minerals. Comets and asteroids can also deposit water on the moon when they slam into it.But the new data, collected by a retired NASA spacecraft called LADEE, revealed something unexpected. While LADEE was in orbit around the moon, it witnessed meteor showers, the same way we do here on Earth. At certain times of the year, our planetary system crosses into the orbits of comets, some of which are strewn with debris. Most of these cometary leftovers burn up in our atmosphere, sparking the annual sky shows we call the Geminids, the Perseids, the Leonids, and more. On the airless moon, though, these meteor showers bombard the surface. (See a meteor hitting the moon during the recent blood moon eclipse.)“Every stream is millions of particles, like a rain of small impactors,” Benna says. “We saw 29 known streams of meteors, and each stream is related to a comet.”As these little particles collided with the surface, they kicked up the top layer of fine soil, or regolith, revealing much more water than the team expected to find below the first few centimeters.“This loss of water can’t be compensated for by the solar wind hydrogen implantation or by the water that comes with micrometeorites themselves,” Benna says. “So there must be more water in the soil of the moon that can’t be replenished by those two known sources. The only way to explain that is to have an ancient reservoir of water that's been basically depleted over geological time.”Benna and his team estimate that the moon has a fairly even amount of water just a few centimeters below the surface. This means the moon holds more water than could have been delivered to it over its lifetime by solar wind or comets, which speaks to a problem planetary scientists have been trying to solve for decades.A fresh 40-foot impact crater and its dark ejecta are seen on the lunar surface in an image taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.During the early days of our solar system’s formation, giant masses of young planets crashed into each other, flinging debris out into space. All the material that created Earth and the moon swirled around each other in a cosmic ballet. As a result, the moon and Earth share some history, but it’s been hard to explain why the moon seemed to have so little water in relation to Earth’s reserves. While the exact connections are unsure, the amount of water could be linked to the moon’s early volcanic history or the exchange of material between the moon and Earth in the earliest days of the solar system.“This is an important paper because it's measuring the release of water in the present day,” says Carle Pieters, a planetary scientist at Brown University who was not involved with the study. “They have started the discussion about asking, Well, what happens here? Is the water young? Is it old? Is it related to a surface process or is it an ancient reservoir? They're the right questions to ask.”The team's data can now inform scientists working on theories for the moon's origin story and how it might have obtained so much water. In addition, as NASA prepares to send humans back to the moon, whole missions will be dedicated to mapping lunar water and figuring out how the moon may supply future crews with the resources they need to survive.“This is so exciting because they are catching all of this in progress—watching the water move in the exosphere before it either lands back on the surface or is lost to space,” Pieters says. “This is a really important piece of the story.”",
"A dot of white light, seen here at left, marks the spot where a meteor hit the moon during a total lunar eclipse on January 20.On Sunday, January 20, viewers across the Western Hemisphere were treated to the rusty hues of the decade's last “blood moon” eclipse. But as people across the planet watched the moon glow crimson, some lucky observers caught an unexpected delight: the flash of a space rock striking the lunar orb.“It's a rare alignment of infrequent events,” says Justin Cowart, a Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University in New York. “A [meteoroid] about this size hits the moon about once a week or so,” he says. But if this event is confirmed, it may be the first time such an impact has been recorded during a lunar eclipse.An eagle-eyed viewer on Reddit spotted the potential impact during the eclipse and reached out to the r/space community to see if others could weigh in. The news spread quickly on social media, as people from across the path of totality posted their images and video of this tiny flicker of light.Many scientists initially approached the claims with appropriate skepticism. After spotting the buzz on Twitter, “I was wondering if it was maybe a local effect, or maybe something with the camera,” says planetary scientist Sara Mazrouei of the University of Toronto.Flashes of light from an impact are faint and short lived, making them easy to confuse with an errant pixel. But image after image showed the same thing: At 4:41 UT, when totality was just beginning, a tiny speck of light glinted south of the crater Byrgius, a nearly 55-mile-wide pockmark in the western part of the moon.“They all seem to see the same bright pixel,” Mazrouei says. This confluence points strongly toward the flash of light actually being an impact.“This is something that people all around the world didn't know that they were going to sign up for” says Noah Petro, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.Backyard astronomers and starstruck citizen scientists weren't the only ones watching. Jose Maria Madiedo, an astrophysicist at the University of Huelva in Spain, is co-director of the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System, MIDAS for short. He had been working overtime to get eight of the project's telescopes trained on the moon during the eclipse to watch for just such an event.The MIDAS team usually scours the moon in search of faint flashes, the telltale signs of an impact, to learn about the array of space rocks that bombard our lunar companion. But most of these events are too dim to spot when the moon is full. The team does the bulk of their observing in the five days before and after a new moon. An eclipse, however, dulls the full moon's usually vibrant glow, providing one more rare opportunity to spot the tiny flashes of light.A close-up of the darkened face of the "blood moon" shows the flash from the meteor impact.So far, they hadn't successfully spotted an impact during an eclipse, but Madiedo didn't lose hope: “Something inside of me told me that this time would be the time.” And sure enough, his efforts paid off.“I had a very nice reward,” he says.Scientists say the next steps are gathering up the many observations to study the event in full detail, and hopefully capturing an image of the moon's new crater.“The Earth and the moon are in such close proximity that observing the impacts on the moon can help us learn a lot more about the frequency of impacts on Earth,” explains Mazrouei, who recently authored a study detailing an ancient spike in large meteor bombardment on the moon, and thus on our planet.Though Earth's atmosphere protects us from many of the smaller space rocks zooming through the solar system, incoming meteors can still affect the array of satellites zipping around the planet that are vital to keeping navigation, telecommunications, weather forecasting, and more humming along on the surface.And seeing the aftermath of smaller impacts on airless worlds like the moon can help scientists learn about the effects of larger strikes on all kinds of worlds—including our own, Madiedo says.“By knowing what happens with smaller impacts, you could know what could happen with larger impacts without really studying a large impact on Earth.”Finding the new crater on the already pockmarked surface of the moon will take some work, though. The spacecraft vital to this process is NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Launched in 2009, the orbiter took up residence around our moon to study its surface in stunning detail. So far, it has recorded hundreds of changes to the lunar landscape, including more than two dozen new impact craters.LRO even has history finding craters after initial reports of an impact flash. On March 17, 2013 researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center reported sighting a similar faint flicker of light on the moon. By comparing images of the moon's surface from LRO's trio of cameras before and after the event, scientists traced the debris streaks from the impact back to its associated crater.For this latest event, the team responsible for LRO's cameras is not specifically targeting the crater in their sweeps over the moon. The orbiter essentially captures a random sampling of the moon's surface so scientists can calculate the average number of impacts over time, explains Petro, who is a project scientist for LRO. Specifically targeting the new crater would interfere with their statistical sampling.Still, researchers can work to narrow down the new crater's location—and tease out more details about the impact itself—and then scour LRO data to see whether it passes over the right lunar section. Madiedo and his team are working to estimate the impact's energy and mass to assist in calculations of the crater's likely size and position. His initial estimates suggest that the space rock was about the size of a football, and that it left a crater between 23 and 33 feet across.Stony Brook's Cowart is also trying to narrow down where the space rock struck using images from amateur astronomer Christian Fröschlin. He estimates that the crater lies around 29.47 south, 67.77 west. But accuracy is tricky; each pixel in the image represents an area about 2.5 miles across.“So if I'm off by one pixel, then if we target that location, we can just totally miss the crater,” he says.Regardless of whether the craft eventually captures the new crater, the series of events underscores the vital but often overlooked role social media can play in gathering data about natural phenomena, Petro says.“I said going into the eclipse that this is really cool,” he adds. “This observation just reinforces how bloody cool it is.”",
"A planetary fragment orbits a white dwarf star in an illustration of the newfound system.In 1995, a cosmic question was answered when a ground-based telescope picked up on a faint, wobbly signal coming from hundreds of light-years away. The telescope had detected the first exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star, a breakthrough discovery proving that, yes, there are planets beyond our solar system—and hinting at the potential for many more.Astrophysicists have since confirmed nearly 4,000 exoplanets orbiting stars across the Milky Way galaxy. Like our sun, these stars are typically in the so-called main sequence phase of their lives, a period that lasts billions of years and during which the stars burn healthy, hot, and bright.But now, a group of researchers has zeroed in on a planetary body closely orbiting a white dwarf—a burned-out star that is on death’s door. Described this week in the journal Science, the findings are among the first of their kind, and they offer a glimpse at what Earth’s fate could be when our sun begins to die.Led by University of Warwick astrophysicist Christopher Manser, the team discovered the rocky object using a method called spectroscopy, which involves collecting and analyzing the different wavelengths of light coming from the gas disk surrounding the white dwarf. This is the first time this method has been used to identify a planetary body orbiting a white dwarf.Using the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain, the team observed the "color of light emitted by calcium in the disc, and we collected a spectrum every two to three minutes,” Manser says in an email. This technique allowed the team to detect subtle color changes in the disk as it moved closer and further away from Earth. This kind of color shift is called a Doppler wobble, similar to the audible Doppler effect that makes a police siren seem to change pitch as the car races by."For our detection, this change in color was used to identify the presence of a planetesimal orbiting in the disc on a period of two hours," Manser says. The team categorizes the object as a planetesimal, because of its relatively small size.A big part of the reason scientists study exoplanets is to learn more about the evolution of our own solar system. If this planetesimal was once Earth-like, as Manser believes, the outcome is bleak. (Read about the search for exoplanets outside the Milky Way.)As the planetesimal’s star began running out of fuel and expanding—as most sun-like stars do when they reach the ends of their lives—the intense gravity would have ripped apart any closely orbiting planets, reducing them to their rocky cores and generating disks of debris. Manser suspects Earth will face a similar fate.“When the sun will eventually run out of fuel and expand in about five billion years, it’s going to engulf Mercury, Venus, and most likely Earth,” he says. “But Mars and the other bodies like Jupiter, Saturn, the asteroid belt, and so on, they should survive the entire process, although they’ll be on a slightly larger orbit, because some will lose mass and the sun will eventually be a white dwarf.”However, there may be a bright side, says astrophysics professor Lisa Kaltnegger, who is also the director at Cornell University’s Carl Sagan Institute and was not involved with Manser's research. If planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs were to collide, she says, they could eventually coalesce to form new, stable planets. Her studies of this possibility suggest these reconstructed worlds could even be habitable.“After the white dwarf cools down further, we have shown that such a planet could maintain balmy conditions for billions of years,” she writes in an email. For instance, while the dramatic conditions of this new planet's birth would likley deprive it of surface water at first, the life-giving liquid could be re-delivered by impacts with water-carrying comets, so that "instead of a hot dry zombie planet, you could get a planet where life could potentially start all over again," she says.“This paper puts the first puzzle piece in place to determine how planets could form around young white dwarfs from planetesimals.”For now, Manser hopes to apply the spectroscopy method to other star systems where gas disks are present. They may contain more planetesimals that will help fill in our understanding of planetary life cycles, he says, “and we want to hunt for those next.”",
"In her office on the 17th floor of MIT’s Building 54, Sara Seager is about as close to space as you can get in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From her window, she can see across the Charles River to downtown Boston in one direction and past Fenway Park in the other. Inside, her view extends to the Milky Way and beyond.Seager, 47, is an astrophysicist. Her specialty is exoplanets, namely all the planets in the universe except the ones you already know about revolving around our sun. On a blackboard, she has sketched an equation she thought up to estimate the chances of detecting life on such a planet. Beneath another blackboard filled with more equations is a clutter of memorabilia, including a vial containing some glossy black shards.“It’s a rock that we melted.”Seager speaks in brisk, uninflected phrases, and she has penetrating hazel eyes that hold on to whomever she is talking to. She explains that there are planets known as hot super-Earths whizzing about so close to their stars that a year lasts less than a day. “These planets are so hot, they probably have giant lava lakes,” she says. Hence, the melted rock.“We wanted to test the brightness of lava.”When Seager entered graduate school in the mid-1990s, we didn’t know about planets that circle their stars in hours or others that take almost a million years. We didn’t know about planets that revolve around two stars, or rogue planets that don’t orbit any star but just wander about in space. In fact, we didn’t know for sure that any planets at all existed beyond our solar system, and a lot of the assumptions we made about planet-ness have turned out to be wrong. The very first exoplanet found—51 Pegasi b, discovered in 1995—was itself a surprise: A giant planet crammed up against its star, winging around it in just four days.“51 Peg should have let everyone know it was going to be a crazy ride,” Seager says. “That planet shouldn’t be there.”Today we have confirmed about 4,000 exoplanets. The majority were discovered by the Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009. Kepler’s mission was to see how many planets it could find orbiting some 150,000 stars in one tiny patch of sky—about as much as you can cover with your hand with your arm outstretched. But its ultimate purpose was to resolve a much more freighted question: Are places where life might evolve common in the universe or vanishingly rare, leaving us effectively without hope of ever knowing whether another living world exists?Kepler’s answer was unequivocal. There are more planets than there are stars, and at least a quarter are Earth-size planets in their star’s so-called habitable zone, where conditions are neither too hot nor too cold for life. With a minimum of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, that means there are at least 25 billion places where life could conceivably take hold in our galaxy alone—and our galaxy is one among trillions.It’s no wonder that Kepler, which ran out of fuel last October, is regarded almost with reverence by astronomers. (“Kepler was the greatest step forward in the Copernican revolution since Copernicus,” University of California, Berkeley astrophysicist Andrew Siemion told me.) It’s changed the way we approach one of the great mysteries of existence. The question is no longer, is there life beyond Earth? It’s a pretty sure bet there is. The question now is, how do we find it?The revelation that the galaxy is teeming with planets has reenergized the search for life. A surge in private funding has created a much more nimble, risk-friendly research agenda. NASA too is intensifying its efforts in astrobiology. Most of the research is focused on finding signs of any sort of life on other worlds. But the prospect of new targets, new money, and ever increasing computational power has also galvanized the decades-long search for intelligent aliens.To Seager, a MacArthur “genius award” winner, participating on the Kepler team was one more step toward a lifelong goal: to find an Earth-like planet orbiting a sunlike star. Her current focus is the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an MIT-led NASA space telescope launched last year. Like Kepler, TESS looks for a slight dimming in the luminosity of a star when a planet passes—transits—in front of it. TESS is scanning nearly the whole sky, with the goal of identifying about 50 exoplanets with rocky surfaces like Earth’s that could be investigated by more powerful telescopes coming on line, beginning with the James Webb Space Telescope, which NASA hopes to launch in 2021.On her “vision table,” which runs along one wall of her office, Seager has collected some objects that express “where I am now and where I’m going, so I can remind myself why I’m working so hard.” Among them are some polished stone orbs representing a red dwarf star and its covey of planets, and a model of ASTERIA, a low-cost planet-finding satellite she developed.“I haven’t gotten around to putting this up,” Seager says, unrolling a poster that’s a fitting expression of where her career began. It’s a chart showing the spectral signatures of the elements, like colored bar codes. Every chemical compound absorbs a unique set of wavelengths of light. (We see leaves as green, for instance, because chlorophyll is a light-hungry molecule that absorbs red and blue, so the only light reflected is green.) While still in her 20s, Seager came up with the idea that compounds in a transiting planet’s upper atmosphere might leave their spectral fingerprints in starlight passing through. Theoretically, if there are gases in a planet’s atmosphere from living creatures, we could see the evidence in the light that reaches us.“It’s going to be really hard,” she tells me. “Think of a rocky planet’s atmosphere as the skin of an onion, and the whole thing is in front of, like, an IMAX screen.”There’s an outside chance a rocky planet orbits a star close enough for the Webb telescope to capture sufficient light to investigate it for signs of life. But most scientists, including Seager, think we’ll need to wait for the next generation of space telescopes. Covering most of the wall over her vision table is a panel of micro-thin black plastic shaped like the petal of a giant flower. It’s a reminder of where she’s going: a space mission, still in development, that she believes can lead her to another living Earth.From an early age, Olivier Guyon has had a problem with sleep: namely, that it’s supposed to happen at night, when it’s so much better to be awake. Guyon grew up in France, in the countryside of Champagne. When he was 11, his parents bought him a small telescope, which he says they later regretted. He spent many nights peering into it, only to fall asleep the next day in class. When he outgrew that telescope, he built a bigger one. But while he could magnify his view of heavenly objects, Guyon could do nothing to enlarge the number of hours in the night. Something had to give, so one day when he was a teenager, he decided to do away with sleep almost entirely. At first he felt great, but after a week or so, he became seriously ill. Recalling it now, he still shudders.At 43 years old, Guyon today has a very big telescope to work with. The Subaru observatory, along with 12 others, sits atop the summit of Mauna Kea, on Hawaii’s Big Island. The Subaru’s 8.2-meter (27 feet) reflector is among the largest single-piece mirrors in the world. (Operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, the telescope has no affiliation with the car company—Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster.) At 13,796 feet above sea level, Mauna Kea affords one of the highest, clearest views of the universe, yet it’s only an hour and a half drive from Guyon’s home in Hilo. The proximity allows him to make frequent trips to test and improve the instrument he built and attached to the telescope, often working through the night. He carries around a thermos of espresso, and for a while he took to spiking it with shots of liquid caffeine, until a friend pointed out that his daily intake was more than half the lethal dose.“We can spend a couple weeks up here, and we start to forget about life on Earth,” he tells me. “First you forget the day of the week. Then you start forgetting to call your family.”Like Seager, Guyon is a MacArthur winner. His particular genius is in the mastery of light: how to massage and manipulate it to catch a glimpse of things that even the Subaru’s huge mirror would be blind to without Guyon’s legerdemain.“The big question is whether there is biological activity up there,” he says, pointing at the sky. “If yes, what is it like? Are there continents? Oceans and clouds? All these questions can be answered, if you can extract the light of a planet from the light of its star.”In other words, if you can see the planet. Trying to separate the light of a rocky, Earth-size planet from that of its star is like squinting hard enough to make out a fruit fly hovering inches in front of a floodlight. It doesn’t seem possible, and with today’s telescopes, it isn’t. But Guyon has his sights set on what the next generation of ground-based telescopes might be able to do, if they can be fashioned to squint very, very hard.That is precisely what his instrument is designed to do. The apparatus is called—brace yourself—the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO, pronounced “skex-a-o”). Guyon wanted me to see it in action, but a power outage had shut down the Subaru. Instead he offers to give me a tour of the 141-foot dome enclosing the telescope. There is 40 percent less oxygen here than at sea level. Visitors have the option of strapping on some bottled oxygen, but he decides that I don’t need any, and off we go.“I was giving a tour the other day to some scientists, and all of a sudden, one of them fainted!” he says, with a mixture of surprise and regret. “I should have known she was not doing well. She had gotten very quiet.” I clutch the railings and make sure to keep asking questions.Ground telescopes like the Subaru are much more powerful light-gatherers than space telescopes like the Hubble, chiefly because nobody has yet figured out how to squeeze a 27-foot mirror into a rocket and blast it into space. But ground telescopes have a serious drawback: They sit under miles of our atmosphere. Fluctuations in the air’s temperature cause light to bend erratically—think of a twinkling star, or the wavy air above an asphalt road in the summertime.The first task of the SCExAO is to iron out those wrinkles. This is accomplished by directing the light from a star onto a shape-shifting mirror, smaller than a quarter, activated by 2,000 tiny motors. Using information from a camera, the motors deform the mirror 3,000 times a second to precisely counter the atmospheric aberrations, and voilà, a beam of starlight can be viewed that is as close as possible to what it was before our atmosphere messed it up. Next comes the squinting part. To Guyon, a star’s luminosity is “a boiling blob of light that we’re trying to get rid of.” His instrument includes an intricate system of apertures, mirrors, and masks called a coronagraph, which allows only the light reflected off the planet to slip through.There’s a great deal more to the apparatus; staring at a schematic of the device is enough to cause vertigo, even at sea level. But the eventual result, once the next-gen telescopes are built, will be a visible dot of light that is actually a rocky planet. Shunt this image to a spectrometer, a device that can parse light into its wavelengths, and you can start dusting it for those fingerprints of life, called biosignatures.There’s one biosignature that Seager, Guyon, and just about everyone else agree would be as near a slam dunk for life as scientific caution allows. We already have a planet to prove it. On Earth, plants and certain bacteria produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. Oxygen is a flagrantly promiscuous molecule—it’ll react and bond with just about everything on a planet’s surface. So if we can find evidence of it accumulating in an atmosphere, it will raise some eyebrows. Even more telling would be a biosignature composed of oxygen and other compounds related to life on Earth. Most convincing of all would be to find oxygen along with methane, because those two gases from living organisms destroy each other. Finding them both would mean there must be constant replenishment.It would be grossly geocentric, however, to limit the search for extraterrestrial life to oxygen and methane. Life could take forms other than photosynthesizing plants, and indeed even here on Earth, anaerobic life existed for billions of years before oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. As long as some basic requirements are met—energy, nutrients, and a liquid medium—life could evolve in ways that would produce any number of different gases. The key is finding gases in excess of what should be there.There are other sorts of biosignatures we can look for too. The chlorophyll in vegetation reflects near-infrared light—the so-called red edge, invisible to human eyes but easily observable with infrared telescopes. Find it in a planet’s biosignature, and you may well have found an extraterrestrial forest. But the vegetation on other planets might absorb different wavelengths of light—there could be planets with Black Forests that are truly black, or planets where roses are red, and so is everything else.And why stick to plants? Lisa Kaltenegger, who directs the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University, and her colleagues have published the spectral characteristics of 137 microorganisms, including ones in extreme Earth environments that, on another planet, might be the norm. It’s no wonder the next generation of telescopes is so eagerly anticipated.“For the first time, we’ll be able to collect enough light,” says Kaltenegger. “We’ll be able to figure things out.”The first and most powerful of the next-gen ground telescopes, the European Southern Observatory’s eponymous Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) in the Atacama Desert of Chile, is scheduled to start operation in 2024. The light-gathering capacity of its 39-meter (128 feet) mirror will exceed all existing Subaru-size telescopes combined. Outfitted with a souped-up version of Guyon’s instrument, the ELT will be fully capable of imaging rocky planets in the habitable zone of red dwarf stars, the most common stars in the galaxy. They are smaller and dimmer than our sun, a yellow dwarf, so their habitable zones are closer to the star. The nearer a planet is to its star, the more light it reflects.Alas, the habitable zone of a red dwarf star is not the coziest place in the galaxy. Red dwarfs are highly energetic, frequently hurtling flares out into space as they progress through what Seager calls a period of “very long, bad, teenage behavior.” There might be ways an atmosphere could evolve that would protect nascent life from being fried by these solar tantrums. But planets around red dwarfs are also likely to be “tidally locked”—always presenting one side to the star, in the same way our moon shows only one face to the Earth. This would render half the planet too hot for life, the other half too cold. The midline, though, might be temperate enough for life.As it happens, there’s a rocky planet, called Proxima Centauri b, orbiting in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf that’s the nearest star to our own, about 4.2 light-years, or 25 trillion miles, away. “It’s a terribly exciting target,” Guyon says. But he agrees with Seager that the best chance of finding life will be on an Earth-like planet orbiting a sunlike star. The ELT and its ilk will be fantastic at gathering light, but even those behemoth ground telescopes won’t be able to separate the light of a planet from that of a star 10 billion times brighter.That’s going to take a little more time and even more exotic—one might even say dreamlike—technology. Remember that flower petal–shaped panel on Seager’s wall? It’s a piece of a space instrument called Starshade. Its design consists of 28 panels arranged around a center hub like a giant sunflower, more than 100 feet across. The petals are precisely shaped and rippled to deflect the light from a star, leaving a super-dark shadow trailing behind. If a telescope is positioned far back in that tunnel of darkness, it will be able to capture the glimmer from an Earth-like planet visible just beyond the Starshade’s edge.Starshade’s earliest likely partner is called the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), scheduled to be finished by the mid-2020s. The two spacecraft will work together in a sort of celestial pas de deux: Starshade will amble into position to block the light from a star so WFIRST can detect any planets around it and potentially sample their spectra for signs of life. Then, while WFIRST busies itself with other tasks, Starshade will fly off into position to block the light of the next star on its list of targets. Though the dancers will be tens of thousands of miles apart, they must be aligned to within a single meter for the choreography to work.Starshade, under development at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is still a decade or so away, and indeed there’s no guarantee that it will be funded. Seager, who hopes to lead the project, is confident. One can only hope. There’s something uniquely uplifting about the prospect of a giant flower in space unfurling its petals to parry the light from a distant sun to see if its orbiting worlds are alive.When Jon Richards answered an ad in 2008 on Craigslist for a software programmer, he couldn’t have imagined he would spend much of the next 10 years in a remote valley in Northern California, looking for aliens. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, refers to both a research endeavor and a nonprofit organization, the SETI Institute, which employs Richards to run the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), a 340-mile drive from the institute’s headquarters in Silicon Valley. The ATA is the only facility on the planet built expressly for detecting signals from alien civilizations. Funded largely by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, it was envisioned as an assembly of 350 radio telescopes, with dishes six meters (20 feet) in diameter. But owing to funding difficulties—a regrettable leitmotif in SETI history—only 42 have been built. At one time seven scientists helped run the ATA, but due to attrition, Richards is “the last man standing,” as he gamely puts it.I’ve come to see Richards on a hot day in August, soon after a rash of wildfires in the area. Smoke veils the view of the surrounding mountains, and in the haze the dishes seem primordially still, like Easter Island statues, each one staring implacably at the same spot in a featureless sky. Richards takes me to one of the dishes, opening the bay doors beneath it to reveal its newly installed antenna feed: a crenellated taper of shiny copper housed in a thick glass cone. “Looks kinda like a death ray,” he says.Richards’s job is to manage the hardware and software, including algorithms developed to sift through the several hundred thousand radio signals streaming into the telescopes every night, in search of a “signal of interest.” Radio frequencies have been the favored hunting ground of SETI since the search for alien transmissions began 60 years ago, largely because they travel most efficiently through space. SETI scientists have focused in particular on a quiet zone in the radio spectrum, free of background noise from the galaxy. It made sense to search in this relatively undisturbed range of frequencies, since that would be where sensible aliens would be most likely to transmit.Richards tells me that the ATA is working through a target list of 20,000 red dwarfs. In the evening, he makes sure everything is working properly, and while he sleeps, the dishes point, the antennas rouse, photons scuttle through fiber optic cables, and the radio music of the cosmos streams to enormous processors. If a signal passes tests that suggest it stems from neither a natural source nor some quotidian terrestrial one—a satellite, a plane, somebody’s key fob—the computer kicks out an email alert. This being an email he wouldn’t want to miss, Richards has set up his cell service to forward the message to his phone. Conceivably, then, our first contact from an alien civilization could come as a text rattling Richards’s phone on his night table.So far, however, all the signals of interest have been false alarms. Unlike other experiments, where progress can be made incrementally, SETI is binary: Either extraterrestrials make contact on your watch, or they don’t. Even if they’re out there, the chances that you’re looking in just the right place at just the right time and at just the right radio frequency are remote. Jill Tarter, the retired head of research at SETI, likens the search to dipping a cup in the ocean: The chance you’ll find a fish is exceedingly small, but that doesn’t mean the ocean isn’t full of fish. Unfortunately, Congress long ago lost interest in dipping the cup, abruptly terminating support in 1993.The good news is that SETI the research endeavor, if not SETI the institute, has recently received a remarkable boost in funding, sending ripples of excitement through the field. In 2015 Yuri Milner, a Russian-born venture capitalist, established the Breakthrough Initiatives, committing at least $200 million to look for life in the universe, including $100 million specifically to search for alien civilizations. Milner was an early investor in Facebook, Twitter, and many other internet companies you wish you’d been an early investor in. Before that, he founded a highly successful internet company in Russia. His philanthropic vision might be summed up as, if we agree that finding evidence for alien intelligence is worth $100 million, why shouldn’t it be his $100 million? “If you look at it that way, it makes sense,” he says, when I meet him in a glitzy watering hole in Silicon Valley. “If it was a billion a year—we should talk.”Milner is soft-spoken and unobtrusive; I hadn’t noticed him arrive until he was standing right next to my chair. He tells me about his background—a degree in physics, a lifelong passion for astronomy, and parents who named him after the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who became the first human in outer space seven months before Milner was born. That was in 1961, which he points out is the same year SETI began. “Everything is interrelated,” he says.Through one of his initiatives, Breakthrough Listen, he intends to spend $100 million over 10 years, most of it through the SETI Research Center at UC Berkeley. Another project, Breakthrough Watch, is underwriting new technology to search for biosignatures with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile.Most far out of all—in both senses—is Milner’s Breakthrough Starshot, which is investing $100 million to explore the feasibility of actually going to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, which includes the rocky planet Proxima b. Appreciating the magnitude of this challenge requires some perspective. The first Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, took 35 years to enter interstellar space. Traveling at that speed, Voyager would need some 75,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri. In the current vision for Starshot, a fleet of pebble-size spaceships hurtling through space at one-fifth the speed of light could reach Alpha Centauri in a mere 20 years. Working from a road map originally proposed by physicist Philip Lubin at UC Santa Barbara, these tiny Niñas, Pintas, and Santa Marías would be propelled by a ground-based laser array, more powerful than a million suns. It may not be possible. But that’s the advantage of private money: Unlike a government program, you’re allowed—expected—to take a big gamble.“Let’s see in five or 10 years whether it will work,” Milner says, with a shrug. “I’m not an enthusiast in the sense I believe for sure any of this will happen. I’m an enthusiast because it makes sense now to try.”The day after meeting with Milner, I went to the Berkeley campus to meet the beneficiaries of his Breakthrough Listen largesse. Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center, is ideally positioned to take the search for intelligent aliens to a new level. In addition to his Berkeley appointment, he has been named to head up SETI investigations at the SETI Institute itself, including operations at the ATA.Siemion, 38, looks the part of a next-gen SETI master; he has a shaved head, a compact build, and a thin gold chain discreetly visible above the buttons of his fitted shirt. While careful to credit the decades of research by Tarter and her colleagues at the SETI Institute, he’s keen to distinguish where SETI is going from where it has been. The initial search was inspired by the possibility of a connection—reaching out in hope of finding someone reaching back. SETI 2.0 is trying to determine whether technological civilization is part of the cosmic landscape, like black holes, gravitational waves, or any other astronomical phenomenon.“We’re not looking for a signal,” Siemion says. “We’re looking for a property of the universe.”Breakthrough Listen is by no means abandoning the conventional search for radio transmissions, he tells me; on the contrary, it’s doubling down on it, dedicating to SETI roughly a quarter of the viewing time on two huge single-dish radio telescopes in West Virginia and Australia. Siemion is even more excited about a partnership with the new MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, an array of 64 radio dishes, each more than twice the size of the ATA’s. By piggybacking on observations conducted by other scientists, Breakthrough Listen will conduct a 24/7 stakeout of a million stars, dwarfing previous SETI radio searches. Powerful as it is, MeerKAT is just a precursor to radio astronomy’s dream machine: the Square Kilometre Array, which sometime in the next decade will link hundreds of dishes in South Africa with thousands of antennas in Australia, creating the collecting area of a single dish more than a square kilometer, or about 247 acres.There are other SETI approaches Siemion tells me about—Breakthrough Listen partnerships with telescopes in China, Australia, and the Netherlands, and new technologies in development at Berkeley, the SETI Institute, and elsewhere to look for optical and infrared signals. The gist, echoed by other scientists I talk with, is that SETI is undergoing a transformation from cottage industry to global enterprise.Most important, empowered and inspired by the accelerating rate of technological development in our own civilization, we are coming to see the target of the quest in a different light. For 60 years we’ve been waiting for ET to phone Earth. But the stark truth is that ET probably has no compelling reason to try to communicate with us, any more than we feel a heartfelt need to extend a greeting to a colony of ants. We may feel technologically mature compared with our past, but compared with what may be out there in the universe, we’re still in diapers. Any civilization that we would be able to detect will likely be millions, perhaps billions, of years ahead of us.“We’re like trilobites, looking for more trilobites,” says Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute.What we should be looking for is not a message from ET, but signs of ET just going about the business of being ET, alien and intelligent in ways that we may not yet comprehend but may still be able to perceive, by looking for evidence of technology—so-called technosignatures.The most obvious technosignatures would be ones we’ve produced, or can imagine producing, ourselves. Avi Loeb of Harvard University, who chairs the Breakthrough Starshot advisory board, has noted that if another civilization were using similar laser propulsion to sail through space, its Starshot-like beacons would be visible to the edge of the universe. Loeb also has suggested looking for the spectral signatures of chlorofluorocarbons soiling the atmosphere of aliens who failed to live past the technological diaper stage.“Based on our own behavior, there must be many civilizations that killed themselves by harnessing technologies that led to their own destruction,” he tells me when I visit him. “If we find them before we destroy our own planet, that would be very informative, something we could learn from.”On a cheerier note, we could learn a great deal more from civilizations that have solved their energy problem. At a NASA conference on technosignatures (yes, after a quarter century, NASA too is getting back into the SETI game), there was talk about looking for the waste heat from megastructures that we have imagined creating in the future. A Dyson sphere—solar arrays surrounding a star and capturing all of its energy—around our own sun would generate enough power in a second to supply our current demand for a million years. Learning that other civilizations have already accomplished such feats might provide us some hope.Still, space is vast, and so is time. Even with our ever more powerful computers and telescopes, SETI’s expanded agenda, and the gravity assist of a hundred Yuri Milners, we may never encounter an alien intelligence. On the other hand, the first intimation of life from a distant planet feels thrillingly close.“You never know what’s going to happen,” Seager says. “But I know that something great is around those stars.”",
"An illustration shows the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which will scan the sky to find planets around relatively nearby stars.Editor’s Note: This story was updated at 7:05 p.m. ET on April 18.This evening, NASA’s next planet hunter took to the skies aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. After a two-day launch delay caused by issues with the rocket’s onboard guidance and navigation control systems, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, successfully blasted off.“LIFTOFF! Our @NASA_TESS spacecraft has left the launch pad at 6:51pm ET to search for unknown worlds beyond our solar system! Watch #TESS live,” NASA announced on Twitter. About 10 minutes later, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket landed back on Earth, touching down on a drone ship off the Florida coast.Barring any malfunctions, the TESS spacecraft will now settle into orbit and begin searching for planets around the nearest, brightest stars, building up our catalog of alien worlds that are close enough to be scrutinized for signs of life.“A few months after TESS launches, we will be able to point out the first ones of these familiar stars, which host planets that could be like ours,” says Cornell University’s Lisa Kaltenegger.If a planet-hunting spacecraft sounds familiar, it’s likely because of the rich diversity of worlds found so far by NASA’s venerable Kepler space probe. Since 2009, Kepler has been harvesting planets from the cosmos, spying the footprints of these alien worlds in distant starlight. Kepler alone can claim more than 2,600 discoveries, some of which could be rocky planets quite similar to Earth.TESS won’t be doing exactly the same thing as Kepler, says mission scientist Elisa Quintana of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Here’s how the two missions stack up, and how TESS will help us probe the pervasive question of whether we’re alone in the universe.After nine years in orbit, the Kepler spacecraft is running extremely low on fuel, and it will most likely cease operating within the next couple of months. It’s an inevitability that scientists have been preparing for, but that doesn’t make the spacecraft’s end any easier. No one is looking forward to losing what has been the most successful planet-finder in history—a mission that revealed there are more planets in the sky than stars.Even if Kepler did have a longer life span, more exoplanets are always better. What’s more, TESS is looking for particular types of planet, rather than taking a broader census of what’s out there.“I’m most excited about the large number of planets that are between the size of Earth and Neptune that TESS will find,” Quintana says. “These are the most abundant types of planets, and we know very little about them, because there are none in our solar system.”Like Kepler, TESS will be searching for planets that cross the faces of their stars from our perspective, causing their star’s light to dim briefly. Those tell-tale dips in brightness not only reveal the presence of a planet, but also how wide that world is and how long it takes to orbit its star.Unlike Kepler, which stared at a single patch of starry sky for most of its primary mission, TESS will be looking all over. As it zooms around Earth, the spacecraft will be using four cameras to gaze at a whopping 85 percent of the sky, focusing on particular stars for 27 days at most. Its first year of observations will focus on the southern sky, and its next year will map the north.“Before we knew what a huge number of fascinating, diverse planets were out there, the approach of scanning the sky and only looking at each star for a short time was too risky,” Kaltenegger says. “Now that Kepler showed us how many planets are out there, and also how many planets that could be like our own are out there, scanning the sky makes sense.”The planet called Kepler-20f has an orbital period of 20 days and a surface temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes it too hot to host life as we know it.The search for life beyond Earth is necessarily constrained by what we know. Life as we don’t know it could be anywhere, and it doesn’t care that we haven’t deigned to imagine it yet. To help focus the hunt, astronomers are starting by looking for something familiar. And we know that at least once, life evolved on a warm, rocky planet orbiting a relatively stable star.That being said, many of the stars TESS will scrutinize will be smaller and dimmer than our own: the cool, reddish M dwarfs that are the most common types of stars in the Milky Way. Planets orbiting these stars at a distance that’s neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist are going to be snuggled in quite close—orbiting near enough to their stars for scientists to find them on months-long time scales.In addition, the worlds TESS expects to find will be better situated for observations that could reveal whether alien metabolisms are churning away on their surfaces, beneath their seas, or in their clouds.Within its field of view, TESS will be targeting the nearest, brightest stars to our own, which means every star you can see in the night sky, plus at least a few hundred thousand more. This observing scheme will allow scientists to find planets that are prime for follow-up observations: those that are both relatively nearby (within 300 light-years or so of Earth), and that circle stars bright enough to illuminate an alien atmosphere.The majority of Kepler’s planets are too far away and circle stars that are too dim for these kinds of observations. (Here’s how aliens might detect signs of life on Earth.)As these worlds migrate across their stars, background starlight will shine through any alien atmosphere that’s present, offering clues about its composition and puffiness—but it takes an extremely sensitive telescope to collect those clues over cosmic distances.Assuming that the long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope eventually launches and is operational, it will be a leading actor in probing distant atmospheres and characterizing the worlds TESS reveals. In the meantime, other telescopes will be used to measure the masses of the TESS planets, which will help astronomers calculate their densities and compositions and determine when a planet transitions from rocky, like Earth, to something that’s gassy, like Neptune.The Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes could even get in on some of the atmospheric action until Webb comes online, Quintana says.“The delay of Webb is unfortunate,” she says, referring to the new launch estimate of 2019. “However, it does mean that there will be time for TESS to accomplish its prime mission and create a catalog of planets from both hemispheres.”",
"For centuries, planets beyond our solar system—called exoplanets—existed only in theory and science fiction. It seemed nearly impossible to detect planets light-years away, since the relatively tiny worlds would appear billions of times fainter than their parent stars. But in the last two decades astronomers have successfully developed indirect detection methods, most of which rely on measuring the effects of orbiting planets on far-off stars.In 1992 astronomers reported the first planet-size masses around a dead star, the pulsar PSR1257+12, which sits 2,000 light-years away. Three years later came news of the first known exoplanet, a Jupiter-like gas giant orbiting its star closer than Mercury circles our sun. That world was detected around the sunlike star 51 Pegasi, a mere 50 light-years from Earth.The rate of exoplanet discovery has since climbed rapidly thanks to the development of three main detection techniques, which all involve both ground- and space-based observatories. As of January 2012, the tally of confirmed alien worlds has skyrocketed to just over 720. However, the hunt is still on for a truly Earthlike planet, one with the right size, temperature, and composition to host liquid water—and maybe life.The most successful planet-hunting technique to date has been radial velocity, also called the Doppler wobble, with more than 400 newfound planets to its credit. Astronomers using this method look for a star's “wobble”—telltale shifts in a star's light spectrum—caused by the gravitational tugs of orbiting planets. The more massive a planet and the tighter its orbit, the greater its effect on the host star. As a result, the majority of discoveries made with this method have been so-called hot Jupiters, because of their large masses and close proximities to their parent stars.Nearly two dozen planets have been detected using the microlensing technique, starting with the 2003 discovery of a gas giant twice the size of Jupiter orbiting a star 18,000 light-years away. Gravitational microlensing occurs when one star passes directly in front of a background star, as seen from Earth. The gravitational field of the foreground star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of the background star. If the “lens” star has an orbiting planet, the extra mass amplifies the magnification in a telltale way.The transit method, another popular technique, looks for periodic dips in a star's brightness as an orbiting planet passes in front of—or transits—its star, as seen from Earth. By measuring the amount and frequency of a star’s dimming, astronomers can estimate the orbits and masses of its planets. Additionally, researchers can calculate a planet’s surface temperature from the world’s orbital period and its star’s temperature.Since its launch in 2009, NASA's Kepler mission has used the transit method to confirm more than 60 new exoplanets and to identify 2,300 candidate planets now awaiting confirmation via further observations. Monitoring more than 150,000 stars, the planet-hunting spacecraft is the first built that’s capable of detecting Earth-size worlds in a sunlike star’s habitable zone, the region around a star where liquid water—and maybe life—can exist.As of early 2012, Kepler has uncovered 17 stars with multiple planets as well as a new class of planets that orbit double and even triple stars. But only a handful of the exoplanets discovered so far are terrestrial, rocky types like Earth, and very few are in their stars’ habitable zones. For instance, three of the smallest rocky exoplanets yet detected—each no larger than Mars—closely orbit the red dwarf star KOI-961 and are far too hot to host life.Calculations based on initial data from Kepler suggest that a hundred billion planets exist in the Milky Way galaxy. Of those, as many as ten billion may be rocky planets like Earth. Future searches with improved monitoring technology are expected to reveal ever smaller exoplanets, worlds that orbit at larger distances from their parent stars, and even alien moons.Based on the progress made so far, some experts think we’ll find the first truly Earthlike planets in the next year or two. By combining information from radial velocity and transit methods, for instance, astronomers will be able to determine the compositions of an Earth-size planet’s atmosphere and search for telltale signs of life, such as oxygen and methane gases.",
"A dim red star rises over the landscape in this illustration of the newfound planet.Just six light-years away, a frozen world seems to be orbiting a small, dim red star. If it’s truly there, the alien planet would at least partly fulfill a fantasy decades in the making, and it could become one of the most promising targets for astronomers keen on getting to know the many worlds beyond our solar system.The newfound candidate planet, described today in the journal Nature, orbits what’s colloquially known as Barnard’s Star, the closest single star to our sun. The bright Alpha Centauri system, which is two light-years closer and hosts a planet of its own, is actually made up of three stars. By contrast, Barnard’s star is a small red dwarf that’s older than the sun and about a sixth its size. It’s invisible without a decent telescope—the close star wasn’t even discovered until 1916.Still, Barnard’s Star has long been buttoned into the lore of science fiction, inspiring astronomers to propose the presence of orbiting worlds as far back as the 1960s, and prompting fiction authors to weave tales of adventure around the hidden pinprick of light.“Barnard’s Star is one of the most famous stars in the sky,” says Ignasi Ribas of Spain’s Institut de Ciències de l’Espai. “People have been looking for planets there forever.”Although scientists didn’t confirm the existence of exoplanets until the 1990s, Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp had reported three decades earlier that two giant, gassy planets seemed to circle Barnard’s Star, fueling interest in confirming such nearby worlds. Van de Kamp’s planets almost certainly don’t exist, Ribas says—the team would have spotted such large worlds during their more recent observing campaigns. But smaller planets could still shuffle around this nearby star, remaining hidden for decades due to their size.Even for stars so close to us, spotting smaller worlds is not nearly as simple as aiming a telescope. For some techniques such as searching for planetary transits—as NASA’s prolific Kepler telescope did—it’s an issue of scale: The alignments that let us spot transiting worlds are relatively rare, but Kepler gazed at a patch of sky stuffed with hundreds of thousands of stars, ultimately delivering thousands of discoveries.Other techniques don’t rely on such alignments but do have limits in the types of planets they can reveal. And in most cases, the myriad signals that reveal the presence of planets get tougher to tease out as those worlds decrease in size, says Caltech’s Erik Petigura.In 2016, Ribas and his colleagues began aiming the CARMENES instrument, mounted at Spain’s Calar Alto observatory, at Barnard’s Star. They were looking for slight wobbles in the star’s motion—the gravitational fingerprints of an orbiting planet tugging ever so gently on its star. Data sets gathered over 20 years by six different observing instruments had already suggested that such a planet might exist; if so, the data hinted that it likely took 233 Earth-days to complete an orbit.An illustration shows the relative distances of Barnard's Star and the Alpha Centauri system from our solar system.After 300 additional observations, Ribas and his colleagues were satisfied they had found those 233-day periodic jiggles in the star’s motion.“Now, we have almost 800 measurements that we’re publishing,” he says. “We got this very clear signal that is there, so we have no doubt that this periodicity is there.”But their work wasn’t finished. Once they had a signal, the team needed to rule out other possible sources of the jiggle, such starspots or active regions, that might be masquerading as a planet. Many red dwarf stars produce numerous flares and spasms that can look at first like an orbiting planet. But based on observations, Barnard’s Star is exceptionally quiet and well-behaved, which is why Ribas and his team are now reasonably confident in their detection.“We’re 99-percent sure this is a planetary signal—but 99 is not 100,” he says. “What if the Barnard Star planet is not really there? It will be shot many, many times and people will try to kill it, but that’s how science works.”Some astronomers, perhaps unsurprisingly, are not as convinced that the team has spotted an extremely nearby exoplanet.“There is clearly some periodic signal in the data, and it's reassuring that it seems to be present in multiple datasets,” Petigura says. “However, I would not call it a secure detection.”What’s more, the two decades’ worth of data bolstering the team’s claim are messy and inconclusive, says Yale University’s Debra Fischer.“This was a heroic effort,” she says. “However, even with the number of observations that were analyzed here, the putative signal is swamped by measurement errors. Fortunately, next generation spectrographs that will deliver higher fidelity data are now being commissioned and should be able to follow up on this suggested planet candidate.”If follow-up studies do show the planet is real, the world is at least three times as massive as Earth, and it’s quite cold. The planet’s long orbit around its dim stellar host means that its surface temperature is around -270 degrees Fahrenheit, on average—much too cold to support surface life as we know it.“If I had to speculate about what this planet would look like, I would say that it could resemble a scaled-up version of some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn,” Petigura says. “Something like Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, or Titan with large amounts of rock but water ice as well.”A key question is whether the world is large enough to retain an atmosphere; if so, it could be more like a puffy, mini-Neptune than a solid super-Earth. Even so, Petigura says, “if it had an Earth-like atmosphere, the planet would be far too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface.”That being said, there are plenty of frozen planets populating the annals of science fiction, like Hoth, an iconic battleground in Star Wars, or Delta Vega, the ice world on which a young Captain Kirk meets the elder Spock in Star Trek. And a planet orbiting Barnard’s Star serves simply as a waystation for space travelers in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series.So, even if this candidate planet is too cold for life as we know it, it’s an alluring world that could fit right into the pages of our imagination.",
"The Kepler space telescope sails through our solar system in an illustration.One of Earth’s most venerable planet-hunters, NASA’s Kepler spacecraft, has gone quiet. Today, the space agency announced that after nearly a decade of staring at the stars, Kepler is out of fuel. Now, the spacecraft will stay in its Earth-trailing orbit, looping around the sun and never coming closer than a million miles from home.“NASA’s original planet hunter, the Kepler space telescope, has run out of fuel,” Paul Hertz, NASA’s Astrophysics Division director, announced today during a press conference. “This is not unexpected, and this marks the end of spacecraft operations for Kepler and the end of the collection of science data.”To say Kepler revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos is no overstatement: The mission showed us that extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, circle nearly every star in the sky, and that roughly one-fifth of those worlds are similar to Earth in size and orbit. In other words, Kepler told us that planets are a common consequence of star formation and not the result of some rare, unlikely event. (In addition to piles of planets, Kepler may have recorded the first known alien moon.)“Thanks to Kepler's amazing legacy, we now know that small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of other stars are plentiful,” says Victoria Meadows of the University of Washington, referencing the region around a star where conditions are favorable for life as we know it. “The future of exoplanet science is very bright.”Now that Earth’s sharpest planet-hunting eye has closed, astronomers will be busy sifting through and understanding piles of data collected by the spacecraft, plotting new missions and designing new instruments. And with the next generation of planet-spying spacecraft, scientists will be focused on characterizing these worlds that hide in our sky.After all, the most elusive of astronomical quarries is still out there: a planet elsewhere in the galaxy with signs of life.“We will be mapping out what these exoplanets are made of, from their interiors to the edges of their atmospheres, in an unprecedented level of detail,” says Caltech’s Jessie Christiansen. “Kepler has lifted the veil on the diversity of planets and planetary systems surrounding us—now it’s time to really explore.”Launched in 2009, Kepler stared at the same swath of northern sky for four years, looking for the short dips in starlight caused by alien worlds marching across their stars’ faces. It shook some 2,300 confirmed planets loose from that starfield, revealing that such bodies are common, that planets rarely live alone, and that the cosmos grows an extraordinary variety of strange and unexpected worlds.In 2013, though, Kepler lost a crucial bit of machinery that helped it stare, unblinking, at that star-studded patch. Instead of turning off, Kepler began a different set of observations, alternately swiveling to stare at more than half a million stars—as well as planets in our own cosmic backyard—as part of its K2 mission.But for the last couple years, Kepler has been on borrowed time. Mission managers knew its fuel would run out, and with no way to refill the spacecraft’s gas tank, Kepler fell quiet two weeks ago, as teams scrambled to retrieve the last of the spacecraft’s data.“We collected every bit of possible science data and returned it all to the ground safely,” says Charlie Sobeck of NASA’s Ames Research Center. “In the end, we didn’t have a drop of fuel left over for anything else.”While Kepler may no longer beam new data to Earth, its treasure troves are still ripe for mining. More than nine years of data from both the primary Kepler field and secondary K2 observing programs are waiting for scientists to dive in and try and make sense of the first large-scale planetary census ever taken.One of those scientists is Lauren Weiss, at the University of Hawaii. She’s embarking on a project to examine the planets orbiting a hundred Kepler stars to determine their masses and orbits, the architectures of those systems as a whole, and the ways in which planets end up where they are.A composite image of the Messier 81 (M81) galaxy shows what astronomers call a "grand design" spiral galaxy, where each of its arms curls all the way down into its center. Located about 12 million light-years away in the Ursa Major constellation, M81 is among the brightest of the galaxies visible by telescope from Earth.“It’s the only way to understand if our solar system as a whole is common or rare: fully characterizing the inner parts of planetary systems, and then connecting those planets to outer planets that we have yet to discover,” she says.And now that we know our solar system is one among billions, scientists says it’s time to actually get to know some of those faraway worlds—not just in a statistical sense, but to figure out what they’re made of and what their histories are.“Kepler has taught us that Earth-size planets are practically everywhere,” says Courtney Dressing of the University of California, Berkeley. “It's time to search the habitable zones of nearby stars to find our nearest neighbors.”NASA’s TESS mission is currently surveying 200,000 nearby stars and looking for the brightest, best planets to characterize. In the future, that characterization work could be done with instruments like the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope or with giant ground-based telescopes currently being designed, such as the European Extremely Large Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, or the embattled Thirty Meter Telescope.Future missions employing special shades that preferentially block starlight will help Earthlings directly image exoplanets and search them for signs of life, Christiansen says. But for now, there are enough intriguing results to keep astronomers busy.“We are also using the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to investigate exoplanet atmospheres right now, and finding new and interesting results almost every time,” she says.One of the big motivators for peering deeply into an alien atmosphere is to search for signs of life beyond Earth, including biosignatures that might be written into alien clouds, says Yale University’s Debra Fischer.Right now, we don’t have instruments capable of easily sniffing out these potential clues. But several missions are being designed that could spot them, such as HabEx or LUVOIR, which are intended to pick apart the light coming from far-off planets and read their chemical composition in a process known as spectroscopy.“Exoplanet spectroscopy or bust!” Fischer declares.",
"Green plants on Earth reflect infrared light, which can be detected from afar with the right kinds of instruments.If alien astronomers are out there searching for signs of life on Earth, they might just find it in the telltale pattern of light reflected by our plants, from redwood forests to desert cacti to grass-covered plains. That reflected fingerprint has been visible since vegetation first began carpeting our rocky terrestrial landscape about half a billion years ago. And as Earth aged and evolution marched onward, the reflected signal strengthened.Now, two astronomers are suggesting that plants could leave similar fingerprint-like patterns on distant exoplanets, and perhaps the first signs of life beyond our solar system could come from light reflected by forests covering an alien moon like Endor or cacti living in Tatooine’s deserts.A startling sunset reddens the Lemaire Channel, off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The continent’s coastal ice is crumbling as the sea and air around it warm. This photo originally published in “The Larsen C Ice Shelf Collapse Is Just the Beginning—Antarctica Is Melting.”“We’re trying to figure out—with all the planets we’re finding—what are the signatures that could indicate habitability?” says Cornell University’s Lisa Kaltenegger, who recently described Earth’s leafy signature in a study published in the journal Astrobiology.“We really want to identify the handful, or two or three, that give us the best chance to pick up signs of life.” (How would people react to finding alien life? Science says, it’s complicated.)While this isn’t the first time scientists have suggested looking for life in a far-off planet’s light, Kaltenegger’s team adds a twist: Such reflections can also offer a good estimate for an alien planet’s evolutionary advancement, based on our knowledge of how things work on Earth.“This idea that you could find vegetation on another planet has been around. But nobody ever used Earth’s own geological history as an archive,” Kaltenegger says. “We don’t have a second planet with habitability, but we do have our Earth through time, and it would be really smart to study it.”Several decades ago, the Galileo spacecraft, which was headed for Jupiter, swiveled to stare at Earth’s reflected light. It spied the signs of biology at work in the presence of atmospheric gases such as ozone and methane. More recently, astronomers have teased apart Earthshine, or the bit of Earth-light that sometimes dimly illuminates the darker part of a crescent moon’s face. They found life’s fingerprints there, too.Now, scientists searching for life beyond Earth are debating how biology might leave molecular marks in alien atmospheres, either by producing particular compounds or by shifting the mix of gases swaddling a planet.“In recent years, the possible remote detection of biosignatures from exoplanets has become one of the most exigent—but also most challenging—problems in modern astrophysics,” says Michael Sterzik of the European Southern Observatory.The signature Kaltenegger is working with is a bit different, though. For reasons that aren’t exactly clear, photosynthetic plants reflect specific wavelengths of infrared light, with some plants being more reflective than others. Called the vegetation red edge, this pattern is visible in near-infrared wavelengths, which are a bit longer than the colors our eyes perceive yet are easily detected by the right kind of telescope.Detecting the infrared signature depends on a number of factors, including how much of a planet’s surface is covered by vegetation, whether the planet is warmer or cooler, what the cloud cover is like, and the sensitivity of the telescope being used. (On some alien worlds, trees might even bloom black.)Sterzik, who looked for this very signature in Earthshine in 2012, notes that it’s quite difficult to spot. Even the Galileo spacecraft could barely see it, and it was much closer to Earth than the nearest alien telescope is likely to be. Today’s telescopes aren’t up to the task of finding such a signature on exoplanets. But space- and ground-based observatories that are currently in development, such as the Extremely Large Telescope, could do the trick.“It’s super doable. It’s hard, and it’s a small signature, but it’s there,” Kaltenegger says.As part of their work, Kaltenegger and Cornell’s Jack O’Malley-James wanted to find out how long the fingerprints of vegetation on Earth have been visible.Based on the fossil record, scientists know that the first mosses began creeping across Earth’s barren surface around 500 million years ago, capturing sunlight and turning it into energy. Eventually, those primordial plants diversified and erupted into a riotous mix of ferns, trees, and flowers that, at times, have covered nearly 90 percent of Earth’s land surface.By simulating the light reflected by plants and placing it within a simulated planetary atmosphere, Kaltenegger and O’Malley-James found that as soon as plants appeared and colored the Earthly landscape, they produced a detectable signature. It was weak at first, but that fingerprint grew stronger over time as plants spread across more of Earth’s surface, although the planet’s total reflectivity during ice ages would have made that burgeoning vegetation signature harder to tease from the mix.What’s more, the team thinks the signal could get even brighter in the future—depending, of course, on how we take care of our planet. If we end up with a parched, desert landscape dominated by highly reflective cacti, life-forms on Earth will be easy for alien astronomers to spot. But developing a more opaque greenhouse gas-trapping atmosphere means that, among many other consequences, leafy Earth-life will no longer be detectable by curious extraterrestrials.The pair suggests that scanning the light reflected by distant exoworlds for these leafy signals should be one of several tools used to scrutinize the thousands of potentially habitable planets being discovered across the cosmos by missions such as Kepler and TESS.“Even with big telescopes, it’s going to be incredibly time-consuming to look at these planets in detail, so we’ll have to pick out the best ones,” Kaltenegger says.Based on this work, she suggests that older, hotter exo-Earths might be the best targets for life-hunting telescopes, because leafy reflected light increases as a planet ages. But she’s quick to point out that this signature alone would not be definitive proof that an alien biosphere exists. Various minerals could mimic the infrared signal, Kaltenegger says, which is why she’d also like to see, for instance, a tantalizing combination of atmospheric gases as well.If such a signature was found on an alien world, it might then be possible to determine how quickly evolution is at work on that planet. We’d know the planet’s age, based on the age of its star, and we’d be able to compare how much vegetation is covering its surface relative to the age at which a comparable amount blanketed Earth.“There’s a lot of discussion about what sets the evolutionary speed on a planet,” Kaltenegger says, “and we only have one example: us.”",
"Not too far away, a small star recently unleashed an unexpectedly intense series of flares. The series kicked off with a behemoth eruption that was 10,000 times more powerful than anything ever recorded from the sun. For a few brief moments, the star blazed many times brighter than normal.Another half-dozen flares and two weeks later, the episode ended. But the explosive cluster had been hotter, more powerful, and longer-lasting than scientists had expected to see. It would definitely not be good news for any planets orbiting close to the tempestuous star.The star is a young red dwarf that is only about one-third the sun’s mass. It’s part of a binary dwarf system called DG Canum Venaticorum (or DG CVn for short), located about 60 light-years away. Red dwarfs are the most plentiful type of star in the galaxy, outnumbering everyone else by about three to one. Small, cool, and remarkably long-lived, these stars are considered by many scientists to be excellent hosts for life-friendly planets.But on April 23, you would not have wanted to be anywhere near this little star. Spinning 30 times faster than the sun, the star’s rapid rotation amplified a burgeoning distortion in its magnetic field. When the tension finally snapped, it launched the mega-flare into space. As observed by NASA’s Swift satellite, that initial explosion reached a temperature of about 200 million Celsius (more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun). It released enough high-energy X-rays to briefly outshine the star itself — and its nearby friend — in all wavelengths of light.If a comparable flare had erupted from the sun and been followed by a cloud of charged particles, Earth would be in a bit of trouble, says astronomer Rachel Osten of the Space Telescope Science Institute. Those particle storms that often accompany flares are called coronal mass ejections, and when they’re energetic enough, they can disrupt both ground- and space-based communication systems.“In terms of our own space weather, it is the mass ejections and energetic particles that can do the most damage,” she says. “The effects [of this mega-flare] would be worse than the biggest space weather event we’ve experienced so far.” (Here’s a description of the massive 1859 eruption known as the Carrington Event.)But in addition to messing with power grids, knocking out short-wave radio communication systems and disrupting the global positioning system, such a mega-flare would have a notable bright side: Spectacular auroras, observable down to very low latitudes instead of just around the poles.Of course, this little star’s super-spasm was no threat to our home planet. But any planets in its life-friendly zone would have been in for a rough time. “It must surely have been catastrophic,” says astrophysicist Stephen Drake of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.Red dwarfs are cooler than the sun, so planets warm enough to have liquid water on their surfaces orbit nearer the star, at perhaps one-tenth the Earth-sun distance. Because of that, these planets are tidally locked in orbit and always have the same face pointed toward their star. In other words, one half of the planet is bathed in perpetual day, the other half blanketed by endless night.A mega-flare of this size, followed by a coronal mass ejection, would not be a welcome occurrence for a planet snuggled close to DG CVn — especially not for the part of the planet staring at the star.“Any ozone layer on the star-facing hemisphere would surely be destroyed, the upper atmosphere would be hit by this large pulse of radiation, and then, maybe several hours later, if the geometry lined up, the associated coronal mass ejection would crash into the planet’s magnetosphere, and likely completely collapse it to the planet’s lower atmosphere on the star-facing hemisphere,” Drake says. “I would imagine that this, if the planet supported life, would produce the kind of major extinction event that we see a number of examples of in the Earth’s history.”Whew.Many astronomers are excited about the possibilities of finding habitable planets around red dwarf stars. In addition to being close to the star and relatively easy to spot, these planets also have the luxury of maturing into old, old, old age. Red dwarf stars are exceptionally long-lived, with lifespans calculated to be on the order of trillions of years, so any nearby extraterrestrial lifeforms theoretically have lots of time to evolve.But one of the chief concerns raised when discussing habitable planets around red dwarfs is the stars’ propensity for violent stellar outbursts, which could deal deadly blows to any organisms struggling to gain a toehold on their home worlds.Yet flares the size recorded earlier this year around DG CVn are rare, Drake says, and tend to occur when the stars are very young — as this star is. Scientists estimate DG CVn is only about 30 million years old, which makes it less than one percent of the solar system’s age. So, planets forming around it are still very young, and far from habitable at this point.“Any planets it may have in its habitable zone are still completely inhospitable to life,” Drake says. “Their surfaces are likely still molten. It took life perhaps a billion years to eventually develop on the Earth, as you know, so DG CVn still has lots of time to become the host star of a planet with life.”",
"Over its lifetime, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured many stunning images. Among the most memorable is this edge-on mosaic of the Sombrero galaxy. With its relatively high brightness magnitude and at a distance of 28 million light-years from Earth, Messier 104, as Sombrero is more formally known, is easily viewed through a small telescope.The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to free astronomers of a limitation that has plagued them since the days of Galileo—Earth's atmosphere. Shifting air pockets in the atmosphere block and distort light, limiting the view from even the most powerful Earth-bound instruments.Orbital telescopes function as eyes in the sky that allow astronomers to peer farther into the universe and see the cosmos more clearly.Scientists began dreaming of such a telescope in the 1940s, but it took more than four decades for those dreams to become reality with the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope's original October 1986 launch was scrapped after the loss of the space shuttle Challenger.When the telescope finally became operational in 1990, it began to return unprecedented but flawed images. Its images were superior to those of Earth-bound instruments but slightly blurred due to an optical problem.In December 1993 astronauts from the space shuttle Endeavour performed five days of spacewalks to repair the telescope in orbit some 353 miles (569 kilometers) above the Earth. The repair worked, and Hubble began to deliver crystal-clear images.Hubble's images have helped to pin down the age of the universe, which the expansion rate of pulsating stars suggests is some 13 billion to 14 billion years.Hubble has also captured images of many ancient galaxies, in all stages of evolution, and so lets scientists see back into the past days of a young and developing universe.The telescope was also instrumental in the discovery of dark energy, a little-known but ubiquitous force that works against gravity and contributes to the ongoing expansion of the universe.Hubble also measures the atmospheres of planets outside our own solar system, exploring their compositions and building data that could someday aid the search for extraterrestrial life.Despite its many achievements, Hubble is likely nearing the end of its life. The telescope is due for its last periodic servicing in May 2009. Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled for launch in 2013.The new instrument will orbit much farther from Earth (940,000 miles/1.5 million kilometers)—the better to peer farther through the dust of space into the earliest formations of stars, solar systems, and galaxies.The Hubble is just one of NASA's orbiting "great observatories." The group also includes the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.Spitzer is an infrared orbiting telescope that can detect distant or faint sources of radiation that would otherwise be distorted by Earth's atmosphere. Spitzer scientists often describe their mission as a search for "the old" (the universe's earliest stars and galaxies), "the cold" (brown dwarfs, possibly stars that failed to ignite, and circumstellar discs, broad rings of material orbiting a star) and "the dirty" (dust-obscured processes such as star and planet formation).Chandra captures the rays that emit from the universe's most violent events, such as supernovae. This radiation sheds light on the life cycles of stars, the formation of black holes, and the nature of quasars.",
"Laguna de Tuyajto, a salt lake in Los Flamencos National Reserve, adds color to the desert landscape.Standing in the middle of the Atacama Desert, it’s easy to feel like the only person on Earth.The region is isolated and one of the driest regions in the world. Drier deserts can only be found at the Earth’s poles. Some parts of the desert’s more than 40,000 square miles occasionally see rain, but the driest reaches of the desert landscape go the entire year without seeing a single drop.Despite the parched earth or perhaps thanks to it, life in the Atacama has uniquely adapted to thrive in these conditions.In particular, the town of San Pedro, which sits within half a day’s drive from the border of Bolivia, has become one of the region’s most popular hubs. Those who visit come to see the natural geological wonders that exist in the Atacama.Flamingos can be found feasting on sea monkeys in small pools of water in the salt flat—a diet that gives them their bright pink color.At lower altitudes, tourists can enjoy a wide variety of natural formations. The desert is home to a number of small, active, but rarely troublesome volcanoes. Craggy canyons are nestled among these formations and easily accessible from San Pedro. Up close, the rocky walls sound alive, like they haven’t quite settled into place. That’s because as temperatures warm throughout the day and the water in the rocks expands, hundreds of little popping sounds can be heard as the rocks slowly contract.Occasionally, a peregrine falcon nest can be spotted in desert canyons, although actually seeing a falcon is more difficult. Local tour guides note that the birds tend to avoid people.One bird species that doesn’t seem to mind people are flamingos, and their nesting grounds are near the region’s famous Salar de Atacama, a large salt flat. The flamingos feed on sea monkeys, which give them their bright pink color. They can be found in the small pools of salty water punctuating the salt flat’s 1,200 square miles.Salt flats are geological formations unique to deserts. While lakes typically form when there are depressions in the terrain, the water quickly evaporates in deserts, leaving behind minerals.While some salt flats are entirely smooth, the Salar de Atacama has thousands of small, miniature salt formations that look like bumps from a popcorn ceiling turned upside down.The best time to visit the salt flat is at sunset. During the day, everything is pale and bright, but as the sun sets, the landscape turns from a rosy pink to a vibrant, fiery red.Once acclimated to the region’s high altitude, tourists can visit a nearby field of geysers called El Tatio. The geothermal field has more than 80 geysers with plumes of steam rolling across the landscape. A number of animals unique to high desert altitudes live in the region—ostrich-like rheas; vicuñas, a relative of llamas; and viscachas, a type of chinchilla; are the most commonly seen.The Atacama Desert doesn’t go to sleep at night. The region’s high altitude and cloudless skies make it perfect for stargazing. Even NASA has taken note, installing massive telescopes that take high-resolution images of distant planets and hunt for signs of life.The desert is even helping the space agency better understand what life may be like on Mars. Most of the life in the Atacama are microbes, the only living organisms capable of living in such dry conditions. Scientists believe this may be the case on Mars too, though the red planet is significantly colder.",

"The planet Proxima Centauri b is awash in pale light from a red dwarf star, as seen in an artist's illustration.Small planets sometimes generate gargantuan buzz. For weeks, eager media outlets have been reporting rumors that a potentially habitable planet is circling the star closest to our sun, a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri.Now, finally, astronomers are ready to unveil this alien world.Observations made with a telescope in Chile have indeed revealed a planet about as massive as Earth that orbits Proxima Centauri, which is a cosmic walk to the corner store at just 4.24 light-years away. And if conditions are right, the planet is in an orbit that’s warm enough for liquid water to survive on its surface.Illuminated by a pale reddish light, the world orbits the smallest star in a triple system known as Alpha Centauri, which shines in the southern constellation Centaurus. (Find out how to see Alpha Centauri and other objects in the southern sky.)The Alpha Centauri system, long a wonderland for science fiction authors, is often considered a destination for humanity’s first leap into interstellar space—as well as a potential haven for future civilizations fleeing the inevitable destruction of Earth as we know it.“A habitable, rocky planet around Proxima would be the most natural location to where our civilization could aspire to move after the sun will die, five billion years from now,” says Avi Loeb of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and an adviser to the Breakthrough Starshot project.Even before today’s announcement, Breakthrough Starshot had announced its plan to send tiny spacecraft to the Alpha Centauri system later this century. But don’t expect any postcards from the new planet anytime soon: It will take more than 20 years for a spacecraft traveling at a monstrous 20 percent of the speed of light to reach Proxima Centauri, and another 4.24 years for any data to arrive back on Earth.Exoplanet fans may recall that this isn’t the first time a world has been reported in the Alpha Centauri system. In 2012, astronomers announced that a potential Earth-mass planet orbited the sunlike star Alpha Centauri B—another discovery that was prematurely revealed by impatient publications. But that planet vanished when follow-up observations failed to confirm its existence and instead suggested that noisy data and the star’s own activity were masquerading as a planet.With this new observation, the next star system over again joins the thousands of faraway stars known to host planetary residents—and it looks like it’ll take a rather skilled cosmic magician to make this world disappear.Based on data collected over 54 nights, the signature of the planet is strong, popping out even when the data are inspected by eye and not a computer algorithm.“It’s pretty unambiguous,” says Yale University’s Greg Laughlin. “This isn’t a case where you kind of have to resort to black arts to pull the signal out.”Known as Proxima b, the planet was discovered by a team of scientists working on the Pale Red Dot project—a twist on Carl Sagan’s description of Earth, which looks like a pale blue dot from afar.Scientifically, the discovery is not exactly a surprise. The last decade of exoplanet discoveries has revealed that red dwarf stars like Proxima are very likely to host planets, and a large fraction of those worlds should be somewhat like this new one: small, rocky, and warm enough for water to flow on its surface.While earlier searches for planets around Proxima had officially turned up empty, there were tantalizing signs that at least one planet could be there, waiting to be detected with a more comprehensive search.As a planet goes about its orbital business, its gravity tugs ever so slightly on its star, causing the star to wobble. Larger planets naturally produce bigger wobbles. Smaller, Earth-mass planets tug almost imperceptibly on their stars, requiring long observing campaigns with extremely sensitive instruments to detect.Observations taken sporadically between 2000 and 2014 had hinted at the presence of a planet in an 11-day orbit around Proxima, but its shaky signature wasn’t clear enough to be anything more than a tease. Determined to see if a planetary hand really was the source of Proxima’s wobbles, the Pale Red Dot team aimed Earth’s sharpest wobbly-star watcher, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), at the red dwarf earlier this year.From its location at the European Southern Observatory's site in La Silla, Chile, HARPS measured the motion of the star night after night, and scientists eagerly waited as one data point after another came in. The team almost immediately noticed the same 11-day signal in the data. About 20 nights in, Guillem Anglada-Escudé began to admit that maybe they had a detection—and after another 10 evenings, he started drafting a paper describing the finding, which is published August 24 in Nature.“We tried to remain as skeptical as possible, because we were collecting one data point per night,” says Anglada-Escudé, of Queen Mary University of London. “We didn’t want to claim something like this and then have to pull it a couple of months later.”The data suggest Proxima b is 1.3 times Earth's mass and takes 11.2 days to orbit its star, putting it in the region where the star’s feeble light is warm enough to keep any surface water flowing.With the vanishing Alpha Centauri B planet on their minds—as well as other high-profile planet discoveries that later disappeared—the Pale Red Dot team very carefully tried to confirm their find. First, the team went back and reprocessed the observations from earlier this century. When run through a newer, better pipeline, that tantalizing original signal got stronger.Next, and very importantly, the team needed to rule out the star itself as a source of the 11.2-day signal. That’s not easy, considering the cantankerous nature of Proxima Centauri, which periodically erupts in flares that blast radiation into space.“There are a few diagnostic tests which can demonstrate that what you think is a planet is really due to stellar activity,” says Lauren Weiss of the University of California, Berkeley. “The authors did all of those, and they found that the planet hypothesis is holding up for now.”One of the tests the Pale Red Dot team performed was simply observing the star, reasoning that any regular, deceptive stellar activity should be visible from Earth. But observations with multiple telescopes on the ground didn’t reveal any stellar activity that matched the 11-day period.“There’s nothing that looks correlated in any way,” says Yale University’s Debra Fischer. She thinks the Proxima planet is a credible result, though not quite ironclad yet.There are even signs that Proxima b could have siblings: One additional signature in the data could be the work of a super-Earth on a 200-day orbit, Anglada-Escudé says, but the team will need to do more work to determine the signal’s origin.In addition to ruling out false alarms, one of the most popular ways of validating a planet is to find it using a different detection method. Already, scientists are aiming Canada’s MOST space telescope at Proxima and looking to see if its planet transits, or crosses the face of its star as seen from Earth.“If it does transit, that would be an extraordinary home run. I don’t think it gets any better than a transiting, Earth-size planet in the habitable zone orbiting the nearest star—unless there’s a radio broadcast emanating from it,” Laughlin says.However, the perfect alignment that allows astronomers on Earth to see a planet transiting another star is rare: Laughlin puts the odds at just two percent.Scientists aren’t quite done analyzing the MOST data for transits, but so far the data “do not raise any major red flags that Proxima b is bogus,” says Columbia University’s David Kipping, who is leading the MOST search.Still, further observations made with HARPS or other sensitive instruments coming online in the next few years will help confirm whether the signal is the work of the planet or the star. And waiting a few years to make those measurements could only boost their credibility.Proxima Centauri is part of the triple star system Alpha Centauri, seen here in a composite picture from the Digitized Sky Survey 2."If this really is a planet, the 11-day signal shouldn’t depend too much on when we observe the star. The planet should always be there," Weiss says. "If anyone tries this experiment again a few years from now and doesn't see the same signal, that's a bad sign."As exciting as the discovery is, however, it’ll be a while until astronomers can tell us whether Proxima b is a good host for life as we know it. For now, scientists don’t know enough about the planet to assess its true nature—but based on available information, it’s unlikely to be an Earthly twin, or even similar to Earth at all.“The planet is in a warm orbit, but that doesn’t mean it’s habitable,” says Anglada-Escudé. “This is something we have to discuss a lot.”To begin with, aside from its age, Proxima Centauri is nothing like the sun. It’s about 12 percent of the sun’s mass, has a magnetic field 600 times stronger, and emits the majority of its light in relatively cool infrared wavelengths. It also spits out roughly the same amount of x-rays as the sun, meaning that planets near enough to support liquid water are constantly in the splash zone of potentially damaging energetic particles.Then there are those giant flares, which are tempestuous even by red dwarf standards. The star has somewhat chilled out in its relative old age, but it once shot extreme amounts of UV radiation into space with alarming frequency, potentially dealing a hostile blow to any life on an infant planet’s surface.Not only that, but those stellar tantrums and continued x-ray bombardment could erode or severely alter the chemistry of any atmosphere, leaving the surface relatively unprotected from lethal radiation.“If the atmosphere is thinner, then more UV radiation will hit the ground,” says Cornell University’s Lisa Kaltenegger. “Ground-based life will either have to shelter underground, underwater, or rely on another mechanism to shield itself.”There’s also the strong probability that, at a mere seven million kilometers from its host, Proxima b keeps one face pointing toward its star at all times and one face gazing eternally into the cosmic night.All of these differences don’t prove that life could not have evolved on Proxima b, just that its story would be dramatically different from that of life on Earth.“Life, if it exists, probably had a rougher start than life on Earth,” Kaltenegger says. “But that is exactly why it is so exciting to study these other worlds. They are just a bit different and can unveil an amazing diversity of life we can't even imagine yet.”Follow Nadia Drake on Twitter.",
"As World War II dragged to an end in 1945, the leaders of the “Big Three” allied powers—the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain—met in Potsdam, Germany, to hash out  terms to conclude the bloodiest conflict the world had ever seen. The great powers split Germany into occupation zones, recognized a Soviet-backed government in Poland, and partitioned Vietnam, monumental decisions that shaped the postwar global order. The talks were meant to forge a lasting peace, but within 18 months, a Cold War began that lasted more than four decades.One of the most important moments at Potsdam was not captured in a memo or proclaimed at a press conference. Late in the conference, U.S. President Harry Truman took aside Soviet premier Joseph Stalin to share some explosive news: The U.S. had just successfully tested a weapon of “unusual destructive force.” It was a nuclear weapon capable of destroying entire cities, the most dangerous and powerful armament the world had ever seen.(Subscriber exclusive: For Hiroshima's survivors, memories of the bomb are impossible to forget.)Within weeks, the U.S. used the atomic bomb to force Japan’s surrender. With a devastating and proven weapon in its armory, the U.S. suddenly had the upper hand among the powers who were allies in the war. What followed was a dangerous struggle for supremacy between two superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., that lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.Though the two nations were technically at peace, the period was characterized by an aggressive and costly arms race; bloody proxy wars fought across Latin America, Africa, and Asia; and competing bids for world dominance between U.S.-led capitalist governments and the Soviet-led communist bloc.The Cold War lasted nearly half a century. Here’s a look at why it began, how it escalated, its legacy today—and why some analysts think another Cold War is already underway.The term “cold war” had existed since the 1930s, when guerre froide was used in France to describe increasingly fraught relationships between European countries. In 1945, shortly after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, British writer George Orwell used the term in an essay that explored what the atom bomb meant for international relations.The atom bombs killed more than 100,000 Japanese citizens, unveiling a destructive power so terrifying that Orwell predicted it would discourage open warfare among great powers, creating instead “a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of ‘cold war’ with its neighbours.”Orwell’s prediction of a “peace that is no peace” came true as seeds of distrust between the former allies grew.The U.S.S.R. had borne the highest number of military and civilian casualties in the war—an estimated 24 million—while liberating huge swaths of Eastern Europe from Nazi control. Soviet leader Josef Stalin was dissatisfied with the postwar division of Europe, which he felt didn’t fairly reflect his nation’s contribution.In the U.S., diplomat George Kennan outlined the Soviet Union’s growing distrust in the 1946 “Long Telegram,” as it is now known. Kennan warned that the U.S.S.R. was illogical and insecure and would not cooperate with the West in the long-term. In response, Washington began to pursue a policy of “containment” to prevent the spread of Soviet ideology and influence.The U.S. soon got an opportunity to flex its new policy. In 1947, Britain announced it would withdraw aid from Greece and Turkey, which were both battling communist uprisings. President Harry Truman seized the occasion to ask Congress for funds to assist both countries, establishing what became known as the Truman Doctrine—the principle that the U.S. should support countries or people threatened by Soviet forces or communist insurrection. Stalin saw the move as the opening shot of a shadow war.The term “Cold War” became a shorthand to describe the ideological struggle between capitalism in the West and communism in the East.  American journalist Walter Lippmann popularized the term in a series of articles in 1947 as nations chose sides in the standoff.The U.S. wasn’t alone in worrying about Stalin’s push to extend Soviet influence westward and bring other states under communist rule. In 1948, the U.S.S.R. backed a communist coup in Czechoslovakia and launched a blockade of west Berlin, which had been divided into occupation zones controlled by communists in the east and capitalists in the west.To demonstrate a united front, the U.S. and its allies formed a transatlantic mutual defense alliance known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. On April 4, 1949, the U.S., Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the U.K. signed a treaty agreeing that “an armed attack against one or more…shall be considered an attack against them all.”The U.S.S.R. responded by creating a defensive alliance of its own. Signed in 1955, the Warsaw Pact included the Soviet Union and seven satellite states, including Poland and East Germany, reinforcing the ideological and military barrier between Eastern and Western Europe that Winston Churchill had dubbed the “Iron Curtain” in a 1946 speech.As the two sides faced off across that Iron Curtain, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. engaged in an arms race, pouring trillions of dollars into accumulating nuclear arsenals.The U.S. had an advantage at the start of the arms race. But once the U.S.S.R. built its own nuclear arsenal, the two sides were at a standoff over “mutually assured destruction”—the idea that if either side attacked, the other would retaliate, unleashing apocalyptic consequences for both parties.(See the abandoned Soviet bunkers hidden beneath Georgia's capital city.)Both countries had missile defenses pointed at one another, and in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the countries closer to the brink than any other event in the Cold War. The U.S. detected Soviet missile bases and arms in communist Cuba, just 90 miles south of Florida. Demanding they be removed, President John F. Kennedy declared that a strike on U.S. territory would trigger an immediate nuclear strike on the U.S.S.R.The threat of imminent nuclear war hung over nearly two weeks of tense negotiations. Finally, the U.S.S.R. agreed to dismantle its weapons facilities if the U.S. pledged not to invade Cuba. Behind the scenes, the U.S. agreed to remove nuclear weapons from Turkey; that agreement did not become public until 1987.Nevertheless, both sides’ nuclear arsenals continued to grow exponentially. By the late 1980s, the United States had an estimated 23,000 nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union’s 39,000.Over more than four decades of Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union waged multiple proxy wars across the globe. In the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and other armed conflicts, the superpowers funded opposing sides or fought directly against communist or capitalist militias. Both sides funded revolutions, insurgencies, and political assassinations in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.The U.S. and Soviet Union also jockeyed to prove technological dominance in a 20-year Space Race. The Soviet Union scored first with the 1957 launch of Sputnik-1, the first artificial satellite, while the U.S. was first to send a man to the moon in 1969. Only in the mid 1970s did the two nations begin to cooperate on joint missions.(50 years after Apollo 11, a new moon race is on.)By the mid 1980s, life behind the Iron Curtain had changed. Democratic uprisings were percolating in Soviet bloc nations, and the U.S.S.R. itself struggled with economic and political chaos. The U.S. and U.S.S.R. forged a more open relationship, even brokering a nuclear treaty in 1987 that eliminated a class of particularly dangerous ground-launched missiles from the nations’ arsenals.By 1991, the Soviet Union had lost most of its bloc to democratic revolutions, and the Warsaw Pact was formally dissolved. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the U.S.S.R., opened his country to the West and instituted economic reforms that undercut institutions that relied on nationalized goods. In December 1991, the U.S.S.R. was dissolved into separate nations.The U.S.S.R. is gone, and nuclear arsenals have dramatically decreased thanks to nonproliferation treaties between Washington and Moscow in the 1980s and 1990s. In recent decades, the U.S. and Russia have cooperated on a number of global issues, including Afghanistan and the war on terror.But the Cold War still affects modern geopolitics. Both nations still have divergent geopolitical interests, large defense budgets, and international military bases. NATO still wields political power and has grown to include 30 member states. The alliance now stretches to Russia’s borders and includes former Soviet states and Warsaw Pact members, such as Poland and the Baltic States. Since the 1990s, Russia has seen the eastward expansion of NATO as a threat to its security.Tensions between Russia and the West reached a new high point following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had applied to take the first steps toward NATO membership in 2008, before a new president shelved the plan two years later. Some commentators have likened the current crisis to the beginnings of a new Cold War.(Follow Ukraine's 30-year struggle for independence with this visual timeline.)Is a 21st-century Cold War already being waged? It remains to be seen. Though historians say the decisions at Potsdam set the stage for a long post-World War II rivalry, we may not recognize the beginnings of a new Cold War until it’s visible in history’s rear-view mirror.",
"A mushroom cloud billows above the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, after the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb ever used in warfare. Three days later a second atomic bomb destroyed the city of Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on August 15, bringing World War II to an end.Nine days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, after his mother and year-old brother died and his home was incinerated, seven-year-old Masaaki Tanabe watched his father slip away. His last words: “I see no future as an army officer.” An implacable enemy of America, Tanabe’s father died with his sword at his side. Tanabe’s grandfather wanted to keep his son’s sword, but the occupation forces came and wrested it from him. “Barbarians,” young Tanabe thought. He was determined to take revenge against America, he says.Understandable. He had nothing and almost no one left. His home had been next to Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the now iconic building with the skeletal dome, preserved as an appeal for nuclear forbearance.Now in his early 80s, Tanabe is a handsome man, square jawed and silver browed. He is tradition personified in his gray jinbei robe with wide sleeves. He’s also resourceful and adaptive. He became a filmmaker and studied computer graphics so he could construct a cyber version of the city that the bomb had erased. The result: Message From Hiroshima, a film that includes interviews with survivors of the August 6, 1945, bombing that—along with the atomic bombing of Nagasaki three days later—would kill up to 200,000 people, force Japan’s surrender in World War II, and render unnecessary an Allied invasion of Japan that could have killed millions.Tanabe couldn’t have predicted the wrenching changes that awaited him and Japan. His daughter married an American and settled in the United States. Tanabe long wrestled with the idea that she had embraced the enemy. Two or three years after the wedding, Tanabe discovered a letter his daughter had left at the base of a stone Buddha in Yamaguchi Prefecture, where her grandfather—Tanabe’s father—had died. In it she told her grandfather she was sorry if she had disappointed him. As the years passed, Tanabe, like much of his generation, reconciled himself to a changed world.Seventy-five years after the war’s end, Tanabe’s story is the story of Hiroshima, and of Japan itself: a mix of tradition and modernity, of a determination never to forget but also a commitment not to be defined solely by the past. And as with Tanabe, events personal and public have yoked the two former enemies, Japan and America, to a shared future.Each August 6, the city pays homage to its 135,000-plus A-bomb victims, adding more names to a cenotaph. All other days of the year, its focus is decidedly forward. Today Hiroshima has a near-messianic zeal as the world’s champion of denuclearization, but it’s also a vibrant hub for recreation, research, and commerce.After the bomb fell, Hiroshima was full of miraculous accounts of services restored—water, electricity, streetcars—and of unheralded heroes from near and far who helped bring the city back to life in the years afterward.Nanao Kamada grew up in the countryside nearly 400 miles from Hiroshima. Until 1955, when he was applying to medical school in the city, he hadn’t thought much about the atomic bomb. But in Hiroshima he saw people wearing caps and long sleeves in searing heat, to conceal their burns. He would become an authority on treating A-bomb survivors and on radiation research.Today Hiroshima’s problems are those of many Japanese cities—a declining birth rate, an aging population, inadequate hotel capacity for its more than two million yearly visitors, and aging buildings and infrastructure. But there’s a sense of urgency about preserving the memories of the survivors—the hibakusha. There are about 47,000 of them in Hiroshima; their average age is 82. The city has dispatched hibakusha around the world, in person and via the internet, to tell their stories. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has a video library of more than 1,500 survivors’ tales, some 400 viewable online. Some survivors are even available for video conferencing. Many say that sharing their stories gives more meaning to what they endured.For some survivors, the unfounded fears of other Japanese citizens became more of a burden than the aftereffects of radiation.Shoso Kawamoto was 11 when the bomb fell. He lost his parents, two sisters, and a brother. His surviving sister died of leukemia at 17. Though orphaned, he was fortunate: Rikiso Kawanaka, the owner of a soy sauce business in Tomo, a village some seven miles from Hiroshima, took him in.Kawanaka fed and clothed Kawamoto. He also made him an unusual offer: If the boy agreed to work for 12 years without a salary, Kawanaka would give him a house. Years passed. Kawamoto rose at two in the morning and worked until four in the afternoon—all without pay.When Kawamoto turned 20, he met a woman named Motoko. She was pretty and easy to talk to. She was learning to make dresses and kimonos. They fell in love.When Kawamoto turned 23, Kawanaka made good on his pledge: He gave Kawamoto the promised house. With his own home, Kawamoto felt ready to ask Motoko’s father for permission to marry his daughter. But the father knew Kawamoto was from Hiroshima. He told him that any children the marriage might produce could be deformed from radiation (actually, no health effects have been found in children of Hiroshima survivors). He forbade the union.Kawamoto was shattered. Two days later, with marriage denied him—as it has been for many hibakusha—he quit his job, walked away from the house for which he had sacrificed so much, and left his village. He never saw Motoko again and never again allowed himself to love, fearing more heartache. His life spiraled downward. He says he gambled and fell in with gangsters—yakuza. He considered suicide.Eventually he found work in a noodle shop, his opportunities limited by his sixth-grade education and his status as a hibakusha, a modern-day leper to some. At 70, he returned to Hiroshima and there, finally, found some peace. Now 86, he’s a grandfatherly figure in a straw hat and cotton vest, seen reaching into a shopping bag and pulling out origami planes and cranes. He gives them to children who visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Pull the tail, he says, beaming, and see the wings flap. Printed on the planes’ wings are the words “Hope for Peace.”There is no undoing the discrimination Kawamoto and other survivors suffered. But at Hiroshima University’s Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, director Satoshi Tashiro is determined to try to avoid such future discrimination. The institute aims to improve communication between the media and scientists, so that the public is not swayed by unwarranted fears. What happened to the hibakusha, he says, also happens to those who lived near Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant and Japan’s failed Fukushima reactor.The Funairi Mutsumien Nursing Home houses some hundred bomb survivors. The youngest, now 74, was in utero at the time of the blast. The oldest is Tsurue Amenomori; she’s 103. When the bomb went off, she was less than a mile from ground zero, giving her bedridden parents medicine. She suffered burns on her face, hand, and leg. Today she is cheerful and prides herself on bounding up the nursing home’s stairs. She’s a favorite of the staff.These survivors’ care falls to the Atomic Bomb Survivors Support Division, which has a staff of 32 led by Takeshi Yahata, a son of hibakusha. His grandfather disposed of corpses after the bombing; now Yahata’s division helps living survivors—with health care, social services, counseling, and nursing home and funeral expenses.Even now, telling Hiroshima’s story can be contentious. A new exhibit at the peace memorial museum took 16 years to complete, partly because of disputes among the exhibition committee, says Shuichi Kato, the museum’s deputy director. Some members wanted stark pictures of the horrors of nuclear war; others argued for more restraint, afraid of traumatizing visitors. (During a recent visit I saw two people collapse.)One debate was over what photo should greet visitors to the museum. It was resolved after Tetsunobu Fujii, the son of a survivor, saw a website photo of a young girl, her hand bandaged, her face bloodied and bruised. He believed it was his mother, Yukiko Fujii. The museum confirmed it was her, at age 10. The committee unanimously chose the photo for the exhibit’s entrance. Her photo at age 20 is at the exit. (She would die at 42.) They are iconic images, impossible to forget.For many who survived the blast, survivor’s guilt and psychological scars endured. Emiko Okada, 82, wears a crane medallion around her neck, symbolizing hope and peace. She was eight when the bomb fell. That morning her 12-year-old sister, Mieko Nakasako, announced she was going out. She was headed to within half a mile of ground zero. I ask Okada whether her sister died in the blast.“My elder sister is missing,” she says.“Missing?” I repeat, wondering what that means after 75 years.“She has not returned home yet.” There is something eerie about the word “yet,” as if Okada half-expects Nakasako to suddenly appear at the door. That lack of resolution haunts Okada.Okada was not orphaned, but she may as well have been. Her parents desperately searched for their oldest daughter, abandoning Okada, who found herself living on the streets, sleeping in an air-raid shelter, eating what she could find or steal—a discarded tomato, a fallen fig. Only later did her grandmother take her in.Victims of the bomb rest in peace in a hillside cemetery on the wooded ground of the ninth-century Mitaki Temple. Its name derives from three nearby waterfalls whose water is offered at the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony.“My parents lost their minds after the loss of their daughter,” Okada says. When her mother was cremated, she adds, pieces of glass that had flown like projectiles that August day reappeared among her ashes and bone fragments.For Okada and others, the horrors replay themselves even today. Okada hates evening glows, “like the sunset when the sky is orange or when the sky is really red, because that reminds me of the night of August 6.”In Hiroshima the young come to terms with the city’s past in their own ways. Kanade Nakahara, 18, studied the bombing in school and in March 2019 went to Pearl Harbor on a field trip. She is determined to work for peace.Others can’t relate to that distant period. Near the Bank of Japan, which survived the blast but was where 42 people were killed, I find 17-year-old Kenta, an avid computer gamer. He regards that day as “ancient history” and isn’t sure what year the bomb fell. He guesses 1964.On the other hand, Haruna Kikuno, 18, shudders at the sound of passing planes—the result, she says, of reading books about the bomb as a child.On the flight from Hiroshima to Tokyo, I introduce myself to the Hiyama family. Theirs too is the story of Hiroshima and its implausible history. The father, 44-year-old Akihiro Hiyama—“Aki”—grew up in Hiroshima, in a family of prominent political figures. His grandfather Sodeshirou Hiyama is honored with a statue for his contributions to Hiroshima’s rebirth.Hiyama’s maternal grandmother, Keiko Ochiai, told him that a friend of hers had planned to travel the day Hiroshima was bombed, but fell ill. Rather than see her train ticket go to waste, she gave it to Ochiai. Soon after the train departed, Ochiai looked out the window and saw the mushroom cloud. Her friend did not survive.Today Ochiai is 91. She married and had a daughter and grandchildren. Grandson Hiyama now lives in the U.S.—in Norfolk, Virginia. There, in 2005, he met Leah Shimer. They married and have two children: son Kai, seven, and daughter Emi, five, who hugs her stuffed unicorn.During the war, Shimer’s grandfather Sterling Arthur Shimer helped design the engines of the B-29 Superfortress bombers. It was B-29s that rained tens of thousands of tons of explosives down on Japan, as well as incendiary bombs, and ultimately, the atomic bomb that decimated Hiroshima.Between flights, Hiyama, Shimer, and I speak of those war years. Kai listens, trying to make sense of it all. “Mama,” he asks, “what’s a mushroom clown?” It falls to Shimer to answer. “Dust and debris went up into the sky when the bomb went off,” she tells him. “It was something really sad. A lot of people died.”“They are sweet, innocent ears,” she says later. “I am glad I can be the one to introduce some of this to him.” But Kai has one more question: “Are America and Japan still enemies?”“No,” his mother says, “they are friends.” And with that, the family heads for its gate and the long flight home.",
"Seventy-five years ago, the most far-flung, destructive, and lethal war in history approached its end. World War II lived up to its name: It was a true global conflict that pitted the Allied powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China, and their smaller allies—against Germany, Japan, Italy, and a few other Axis nations. Some 70 million men and women served in the armed forces, taking part in the greatest military mobilization in history. Civilians, however, did most of the suffering and dying. Of the estimated 66 million people who perished, nearly 70 percent—some 46 million—were civilians, including six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust. Tens of millions more were uprooted from their homes and countries, many of them living in displaced persons camps for years to come.Equipment and supplies litter the island of Iwo Jima, scene of one of the bloodiest battles of the war in the Pacific. After five days of fierce fighting, U.S. marines raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi (background). But the fighting would rage for another three weeks, driving even battle-hardened warriors to their limit. Said one veteran: “I came across marines sitting on the ground, hands to their faces, sobbing their hearts out.”The war’s aftereffects were as staggering as its scale. It laid the groundwork for the world we’ve known for more than seven decades, from the dawn of the nuclear age to the creation of Israel to the emergence of the United States and Soviet Union as the world’s dueling superpowers. It also sparked the formation of international alliances such as the United Nations and NATO, all designed to prevent such a cataclysm from happening again.Yet, with the passage of time, public awareness of the war and its almost unfathomable consequences has faded, becoming as dim as the sepia tones of an old photograph. At the same time, firsthand witnesses are dwindling in number. According to U.S. government statistics, fewer than 400,000 of the 16 million Americans who served in the war—2.5 percent—were still alive in 2019.But thanks to the willingness of some of the last survivors to share their stories, we’ve been given a valuable gift: a chance to bring the war into sharp focus again by viewing it through their eyes. With no access to the internet or other forms of today’s instant communications, most of these men and women knew little of the world beyond their communities before the war. By wrenching them out of their familiar settings, it exposed them to an overwhelming array of new experiences and tested them in previously unimaginable ways. Many found the challenges exhilarating.That was true for 18-year-old Betty Webb, who was recruited to join Britain’s top secret code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park. Webb was one of countless women whose work was crucial to their countries’ war efforts and who, in the process, found a sense of self-worth and independence they’d never known before.Harry T. Stewart, Jr., the 20-year-old grandson of a man born into slavery, proved himself as well. A New Yorker who had never driven a car before the war, Stewart became a fighter pilot in the famed all-black unit known as the Tuskegee Airmen, flying 43 combat missions and winning a Distinguished Flying Cross.On February 23, 1945, six U.S. Marines planted an American flag atop a battle-blasted hill on the island of Iwo Jima, a fiercely defended Japanese stronghold. The sight of the flag lifted the spirits of the weary marines, remembers John “Jack” Thurman. “Even after dark,” says Thurman, “the artillery shells would go off, and by the flash you could see that flag up there, still waving. Still standing. I couldn’t help but think of Fort McHenry and ‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’ The bombs bursting in air really did give proof through the night that our flag was still there.”These triumphs are inspiring and should be celebrated. Yet what dominates the survivors’ stories are the tragedies experienced by so many of them, Allied and Axis alike. Their accounts are testament to the sheer hell of World War II—the brutality, suffering, and terror experienced, and inflicted, by both sides. Particularly haunting is the testimony of Victor Gregg, a British soldier captured by the Germans. His prison was destroyed in the Allied fire bombing of Dresden in February 1945. Gregg, who witnessed the fiery deaths of German civilians there—some 25,000 perished—was left with an abiding sense of guilt and shame. “These were women and children,” he said. “I couldn’t believe it. We were supposed to be the good guys.” His story, like the others, should remain indelibly imprinted on our minds.",
"Webb, 97, was 18 when she started work at Bletchley Park, Britain’s top secret code-breaking center.“It was in that room there that I signed the Official Secrets Act.” Betty Webb, 97, points with her walking stick to a ground floor room in the baronial mansion at Bletchley Park, Britain’s legendary top secret code-breaking facility during World War II. Through the bay window, a massive desk is visible. “There was a senior intelligence officer seated behind that desk,” she says, “and I remember he had a handgun lying casually beside him, right where that coffee cup is now. I was told to sign and made to understand in no uncertain terms that I could never discuss anything about my work here with anyone. I signed. It was a sobering moment. I was 18 years old at the time.”That was in 1941. Britain was at war. German troops had already overrun much of Europe.Webb had been taking a home economics course but joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service—the women’s army—because, as she put it, “I wanted to do something more for the war effort than bake sausage rolls.” Webb was bilingual—she’d grown up with a German au pair and had been an exchange student in Germany—so she was ordered to report to Bletchley, an hour or so north of London. “It was so secret I had no idea what it was—nobody did!—let alone what I was getting into.”Initially Webb was put to work cataloging the thousands of encrypted German radio messages that British listening posts were intercepting each day. But as the war progressed, she moved to a more creative role: paraphrasing priceless nuggets of intelligence gleaned by the code breakers so no one would suspect it had been obtained by broken codes.German leaders believed messages encrypted by their Enigma machines—this model could generate 103 sextillion combinations—were all but unbreakable. Bletchley personnel proved them wrong.“We had to make it sound as though it was information we’d picked up from spies or stolen documents or aerial reconnaissance,” she said. “The fact that we’d broken German and Japanese military codes was a closely guarded secret, known only to a very few people.”Webb enjoyed the work. “I liked the deviousness of it,” she says with a smile. She also worked on intercepted Japanese messages and was so good at paraphrasing their contents that in June 1945, after the war in Europe ended, she was sent to Washington to help the American war effort in the Pacific. “I flew over in a flying boat,” she recalls. “It was the first time I’d ever been up in a plane. I sent my parents a postcard from Washington. I’m sure they must have wondered what I was doing, but of course they never asked, and anyway I could never tell them.”Decades would pass before any of the people at Bletchley were allowed to speak of their work during the war. “Both of my parents had died by then, so they never knew,” she says. “All the secrecy made it tough to get a job after the war, especially for the men, since you couldn’t tell employers anything about your war years other than that you’d worked at some place called Bletchley Park.”Webb eventually found work at a school whose headmaster had been at Bletchley. “I never knew him at the time,” she says, “but when he saw on my application that I’d been at Bletchley too, no words needed to be said, no awkward questions asked. I got the job.”",
"A handcrafted model of a P-51 Mustang holds powerful memories for Harry Stewart, who flew 43 combat missions in just such an airplane.Nearly a thousand African-American pilots who served in World War II learned to fly at Tuskegee, Alabama, the only U.S. military airfield that trained black cadets. Just 10 of the famed Tuskegee Airmen remain today, and retired Lt. Col. Harry T. Stewart, Jr., who turned 95 last Independence Day, is one of them.Growing up in Queens, New York, Stewart would wander over to a nearby airfield to admire the mammoth aluminum birds and fantasize about flying. He would finally realize his dream in 1944, when he began escorting American bombers to their targets across Europe.During one mission, Stewart—the grandson of a man born into slavery in Alabama—shot down three enemy aircraft while escorting American bombers. He was 21 years old and had never driven a car.During one such mission on Easter Sunday 1945, Stewart and six squadron mates were flying 5,000 feet above Nazi-occupied Austria when suddenly they found themselves outnumbered by Luftwaffe planes. Deadly dogfights ensued, Stewart squeezing off burst after burst from his P-51 Mustang’s six .50-caliber machine guns. Landing back at his base in Italy, he was greeted with fanfare and credited with downing three enemy aircraft—a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.But the rookie fighter pilot was thinking of three fellow aviators shot down in the battle. One died instantly, one managed to crash-land in Yugoslavia, and one bailed out, his body reportedly discovered in Austria after the country was liberated from the Nazis two weeks later.After the war Stewart stayed in the Air Force—President Harry Truman mandated racial integration of the military in 1948—and won the inaugural “top gun” competition with two fellow Tuskegee pilots in 1949. A year later, postwar budget cuts forced thousands of officers, including Stewart, out of the Air Force. He earned his commercial pilot’s license on the GI Bill and applied to fly for Pan American and Trans World Airlines. They rejected him. They didn’t hire black pilots then.The loss of his wings and dignity seeped in. But Stewart had a history of overcoming obstacles. He applied to New York University and earned a degree in mechanical engineering. He found employment and success as an engineer, traveling around North America, the Far East, and Europe. His last job took him to Michigan, where he rose through the ranks at one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipeline companies and retired as a vice president.In 2018 Stewart traveled to Austria for the first time since the war, this time as a guest of the Austrian government. Researchers investigating the fate of downed Allied pilots had determined that Stewart’s squadron mate Walter Manning, the one who had bailed out during the bloody Easter mission, had been captured alive.While awaiting transfer to a prisoner of war camp, the 24-year-old had been lynched by a mob incited by racist Nazi propaganda. Exactly 73 years later, Stewart and his daughter looked on as Austrian dignitaries apologized for the atrocity and dedicated a memorial.Stewart says he never expected to see the Tuskegee Airmen acknowledged in museums and memorials, and written into history books and Hollywood films. His hope for their legacy? “I just want them to be remembered as good citizens—good Americans who felt duty-bound to join in protecting their country during times of need, even in the face of discrimination.”",
"An offer of a bun and a cup of hot tea sounded awfully good to Victor Gregg on that raw London day in October 1937—enticing enough to follow a recruiter back to his office and sign up for the British Army. “It was my 18th birthday,” recalls Gregg, now a hundred. “And you know, as far as I recall, I never did get that cup of tea.”Instead he got a harrowing front-row seat to World War II, from start to finish. After qualifying as a sharpshooter, Gregg was posted briefly to India and was serving in Palestine when the war broke out in September 1939. He spent the next three years in the north African desert, on covert missions behind enemy lines. Later he became a paratrooper and took part in the invasion of Italy. In September 1944 he was dropped into the Battle of Arnhem—a failed Allied attempt to secure a bridge over the Rhine River.“They told us it would be a walkover,” he recalls. “Instead, we ran into some Panzer divisions nobody seemed to have reckoned on.” The fighting was brutal, hand to hand, and the British paratroopers were overrun. Gregg was captured and sent to a labor camp near Dresden, Germany.That winter he made two unsuccessful escape attempts and as punishment was sent to work in a soap factory. He and another POW sabotaged the factory, causing it to burn to the ground—an act for which they were sentenced to death. “They transferred us to a prison in Dresden and told us we were to be shot the next morning,” Gregg said.Fate intervened. That night British and American planes began raining firebombs on Dresden. The prison took a direct hit, and Gregg escaped through a broken wall. He says the horrors he saw over the next few days would haunt him for the rest of his life and fill him with guilt and shame. “Until then my war had been soldiers fighting other soldiers, but these were women and children, civilians,” he says. “I couldn’t believe it. We were supposed to be the good guys.”Gregg escaped from Dresden in the aftermath of the bombing and made his way east to join the advancing Soviet Army. He was with them in Leipzig the day Germany surrendered.After six years of living on the edge, he found it impossible to settle into postwar civilian life. He says he sought out risk and danger, whether it was riding motorcycles, doing clandestine work for the British intelligence agency MI6, or involving himself with underground pro-democracy movements behind the Iron Curtain.Memories of Dresden proved to be a particularly heavy burden. But recently Gregg was invited there to give a talk about his experiences. In the audience was a woman in her early 80s who, as a young girl, had survived the Dresden bombing but lost a leg. As they spoke after his lecture, Gregg says, he found the inner peace he’d been seeking for decades. “Somehow, at last, I felt forgiven.”",

"After five days of ferocious fighting, U.S. Marines raise the American flag atop Iwo Jima’s highest point on February 23, 1945. Two days later, Joe Rosenthal’s photograph was on the front page of Sunday papers across the U.S. The acclaimed image won the Pulitzer Prize that same year.On February 23, 1945, six U.S. Marines planted an American flag atop a battle-blasted hill on the island of Iwo Jima, a fiercely defended Japanese stronghold. Photographer Joe Rosenthal got lucky and captured the moment in a single, immortal image. Within weeks the photograph became the theme of the U.S. Government’s seventh War Bond drive. A postage stamp bore the image. The scene has been reenacted multiple times on screen.Most enduringly, perhaps, a monumental sculpture of the flag raising, based entirely on Rosenthal’s Associated Press photo, stands guard above the Potomac River across from Washington, D.C.A “Special Air and Gunnery Target Map” compiled from aerial reconnaissance photos of Iwo Jima shows Japanese airfields and fortifications. Weeks of shelling by the U.S. fleet failed to destroy the deeply dug-in defenses, including a dense network of bunkers linked by 11 miles of tunnels.And it’s all because Rosenthal swung his bulky Graflex 4x5 camera in the right direction at the right split-second and snapped the shot—without even looking through his viewfinder.The resulting photo is so perfect—in capturing an essential moment, in depicting the courage and camaraderie of fighting men, in meeting virtually every time-honored standard of artistic composition—that for the rest of his life, Rosenthal had to rebut charges that he set up the whole thing.In fact, on that day—five days into one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific War—Rosenthal had just one thing on his mind as he scrambled up the stony, volcanic slope. “As the trail became steeper,” he later said, “I began to wonder and hope that this was worth the effort.”It was, even though Rosenthal showed up too late, yet right on time.Dominated by 554-foot Mount Suribachi, the island of Iwo Jima was an important midway point between Allied bomber bases and Japan. But after the battle left more than 6,000 Americans dead and 20,000 wounded, some questioned whether the tiny volcanic outpost was worth so high a price.Before he reached the summit of Mount Suribachi’s 554-foot volcanic cone, a team of Marines had already raised a small U.S. flag. Marine photographer Staff Sergeant Louis Lowery snapped the moment when the makeshift flagpole was erected, but the sight of that flag drew a volley of fire from Japanese troops. While diving for cover, Lowery broke his camera, so he headed down the hill to get new equipment. Along the way he met Rosenthal, still struggling to get to the top, and gave him the bad news: The flag was already up.Still, Rosenthal pressed on, hoping to get some good shots from the summit. When he got there, he noticed a team of Marines preparing to raise a second, larger flag, on orders from Marine brass, who wanted it to be visible from all over the island.War photographers almost never get second chances at great shots, but Rosenthal knew he had one here. Now he was in a race against time, trying to get a good vantage point in the seconds before the second flag was raised. Frantically, the five-foot-five photographer piled up some sandbags to stand on.“I’m not in your way, Joe, am I?” asked a movie cameraman on the scene. Rosenthal turned to look at him—and nearly missed the shot of the century.The U.S. Army had rejected Rosenthal as a photographer because he had poor eyesight. But it’s reflexes that make a war photographer, and Rosenthal’s were catlike. Through one corner of his eye he caught sight of the Marines raising the fluttering flag. In one movement he turned, raised his camera, clicked his single shot, and left the rest to fate.Reflexes or not, Rosenthal couldn’t be sure he’d gotten his shot. The film in his camera would be flown to Guam for processing, then sent via telephoto equipment to his editors in San Francisco.For insurance, Rosenthal got 16 Marines and two Navy corpsmen to pose triumphantly around the flag. Among them was Ira Hayes, a Pima Native American who was also in the iconic first shot. (He’s the Marine at far left whose hands have just let go of the flagstaff.)“I had my 20th birthday on Iwo Jima,” says John “Jack” Thurman, now 94. “Some of my buddies there didn’t make it to their 19th birthdays. Now old vets like me, we live our lives for ourselves—and for them. My buddies are living through me."Among Hayes’ closest buddies was Jack Thurman, a 19-year-old Marine sniper. As Thurman, now 94, remembers it, the two had climbed the hill that morning, Hayes as part of the flag-raising unit, Thurman as a sniper to protect them.“Hey, Jack, get down here!” Thurman recalls Hayes yelling. “I want my picture taken with you!” The resulting image is a bit fuzzy, and debate has arisen as to who, exactly, is in the photograph. But looking at it today in a sunny room of his Loveland, Colorado home, Thurman identifies himself as the Marine at extreme left, the one waving his helmet with youthful enthusiasm.Admittedly, he says, doffing his headgear wasn’t the smartest thing to do with enemy gunfire coming from every angle. “But, you get used to it,” he says. “That stuff was flying all over the place.”The raising of the flags on Iwo Jima had an immediate effect on Marines all over the island’s eight square miles. As the first flag was hoisted, horns sounded from the invasion fleet, and soldiers fired their guns in the air. (“I looked, and there was the flag!" Hear one veteran's memories of the bloody battle.)After snapping the unposed flag-raising photo atop Mount Suribachi, Rosenthal asked 16 Marines—including Jack Thurman, at far left—and two Navy corpsmen to gather for this group portrait, which he later dubbed his “Gung-Ho” photo.“What a feeling that was!” recalls Bill Montgomery, 95, one of the few Marines who arrived on Iwo Jima the first day of the battle and stayed until the bitter end. “I felt ecstasy! I knew it was all over! So many of us had been killed. We made it through.”Thurman shared that optimism with his fellow Marines, but it was a false hope. The battle of Iwo Jima would rage for another month, claiming more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,281 lives. But through it all, the flag atop Suribachi snapped in the stiff Pacific trade winds. The sight inspired the Marines through every war-weary day—and night.“Even after dark,” says Thurman, “the artillery shells would go off, and by the flash you could see that flag up there, still waving. Still standing. I couldn’t help but think of Fort McHenry and ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’. The bombs bursting in air really did give proof through the night that our flag was still there.”Two days after Rosenthal snapped his shots atop Suribachi, the Associated Press released his iconic image—a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo that, to many, seemed just too perfect.In honor of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima, the flag made famous by Rosenthal’s photograph will be on display at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia until March 30, 2020.Until his death at age 94 in 2006, “Joe spent the rest of his life defending what was alleged as a ‘phony picture,’” former executive AP photo editor Hal Buell said in an interview. Even after an inquiry by military officials and Life magazine editors concluded it was an authentic news picture, the rumor persisted. (Here's how National Geographic spots fake pictures.)As for Sgt. Lowery, the military photographer who missed the shot of the century because his camera broke, for years he contended that Rosenthal’s picture must have been faked. But after the two men had an impromptu encounter at a Marine event years later, he changed his mind.“They remained friends,” said Buell. “In fact, Joe attended Lou Lowery’s funeral.” Now, as the number of men who witnessed that flag raising first-hand dwindles, Joe Rosenthal’s photo preserves the spirit of one of World War II’s most indelible moments.“I think of it every time I see our flag flying, even today,” says Jack Thurman. “That flag is saying to every one of us, ‘I’m still here, buddies. I’m still here.’”",
"Among the most brutal battles of World War II in the Pacific, the Battle of Iwo Jima began on February 19, 1945 and raged for 36 days, devastating the island stronghold.Bill Montgomery doesn’t hear too well these days. At 95, he’s deaf in his right ear and struggling with his left. But he can still hear the sounds of war that pounded his 20-year-old eardrums on a rocky, pork-chop-shaped island called Iwo Jima. And he still remembers the unbridled joy he felt the day he saw the U.S. flag raised there, an event forever etched in the annals of American military history.“It was the fifth day after we landed,” he recalls. “I was all alone, lying on a slope on the edge of an airfield, when I heard some ships’ horns sounding. And cheering started from guys in the foxholes.”He cast his eyes to the summit of 554-foot Mount Surabachi, a point visible from just about every corner of Iwo Jima’s eight square miles. What he saw from about a quarter-mile away sent a charge of excitement through his war-weary body. “I looked, and there was the flag! What a feeling that was!” he says, the wonder still rising in his voice.Six U.S. Marines raise an American flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, five days after fighting began in the Battle for Iwo Jima. Three of these men would be killed before the battle was won. The U.S. Medal of Honor was awarded to 27 servicemen who fought at Iwo Jima, more than any other battle in U.S. history.It was perhaps the most iconic moment of the war in the Pacific. Photographer Joe Rosenthal’s image of six U.S. Marines raising the American flag atop Iwo Jima’s highest point became an inspiration to millions of Americans back home, and remains a rallying point for U.S. Marines everywhere.“I felt ecstasy!” Montgomery says. “I knew it was all over. So many of us had been killed. We made it through.”Except, it wasn’t over. Not by a long shot. The battle for Iwo Jima would rage for another month. Of the 110,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, and pilots who fought on that volcanic outpost, a staggering 26,000 would be killed or injured. And Bill Montgomery would become one of the very few Marines to endure the entire 37-day fight, day after bloody day. Of 50 men in his unit, only a half-dozen or so survived.“I’ve never understood how I wasn’t hit,” he says. “I feel guilty. But thankful, too.”He leans forward, his fingers drumming a tabletop at his retirement home near Atlanta, Georgia. His wife of 70 years, Lea, seems to want to reach out and touch his agitated hands, but instead she smiles sweetly at him. He smiles back and relaxes a bit.The Marines had landed on Iwo Jima, 760 miles from Tokyo, on February 19, 1945. After days of shelling by the U.S. fleet, they were expecting an easy mop-up operation—three to six days of fighting. Instead, the enemy, 21,000 strong, responded with unexpected fury, picking off Marines seemingly at will from a complex network of tunnels.For Montgomery it was a month of harrowing escapes. He spent one night hunkered down in a shallow ditch, afraid to raise his head lest it be blown off by fellow Marines shooting from a foxhole a few feet behind him. That same night, several hand grenades, lobbed toward the foxhole by Japanese fighters, landed short of their target and exploded in a circle around him.“When the morning came, those Marines were astounded,” he says. “They said, ‘We thought you were dead!’ ”It wasn’t the only time the fog of war nearly claimed Montgomery. Crouching in position another day, Montgomery was mistaken for the enemy by a P-51 Mustang fighter-bomber. The pilot dropped his load right on top of him.“It landed right next to my foxhole, didn’t go off, ricocheted right in front of us into the Japanese area, and exploded,” he says. His life was spared, but Montgomery was spitting mad. “I took a few shots at that Mustang,” he confesses. “Ever since then, when I meet a veteran pilot I ask him, ‘Were you on Iwo Jima?’ I never found the guy.” Montgomery says it was the closest he came to snapping during his Iwo Jima ordeal. Others weren’t so lucky.Some 21,000 Japanese troops occupied the island in a vast network of tunnels. Most fought to the death. Only 216 were captured alive.“I came across Marines sitting on the ground, hands to their faces, sobbing their hearts out,” he says. “Their minds just snapped. A lot of us just got kind of numb, immune to any shock.“Toward the end we were told to go pick up the dead Marines and put them on the edge of the road to be picked up by truck and taken to the cemetery. Many of them would have been lying there for a week or so. A lot of guys grabbed a dead Marine by the arm or leg—and it would come off.”Lea gasps at her husband’s words. “I’ve never heard some of this,” she says softly.“That wasn’t a pleasant sight,” her husband says, his eyes locking on hers. Then he laughs. “As a matter of fact, I don’t remember ever seeing a pleasant sight on Iwo. Except the ship when we left.”",
"Digital technology has simplified the alteration of images, such as moving a pyramid to make a horizontal image (above) fit on a vertical cover (below).In the digital age, when it’s easy to manipulate a photo, it’s harder than ever to ensure that the images we publish, whether on paper or on a screen, reflect the reality of what a photographer saw through his or her viewfinder. At National Geographic, where visual storytelling is part of our DNA, making sure you see real images is just as important as making sure you read true words.I’ll explain how we strive to keep covertly manipulated images out of our publications—but first an admission about a time when we didn’t. Longtime readers may remember.In February 1982 the magazine’s cover showed a camel train in front of the Pyramids at Giza. The image produced by the photographer was horizontal; here at headquarters we altered the photo to fit our vertical cover. That change visually moved the pyramids closer together than they really are.A deserved firestorm ensued—“National Geographic moves the pyramids!” came the outcry. We learned our lesson. At National Geographic it’s never OK to alter a photo. We’ve made it part of our mission to ensure our photos are real.I went to our expert to explain how we do this. Sarah Leen is director of photography at National Geographic and has been here for 30 years. A few decades ago it was easier to spot photo manipulation because the results were a lot cruder. Now, she says, “you can’t always tell if a photo is fake, at least not without a lot of forensic digging.” Even our experts can be fooled, as in 2010 when we published what we later learned was a doctored photo from a contributor to Your Shot.We work with the most admired photographers in the world, but just like we require our writers to provide their notes, we require photographers on assignment to submit “raw” files of their images, which contain pixel information straight from the digital camera’s sensor. We request the same for Your Shot photos sent in by members of the public or stock images we buy. If a raw file isn’t available, we ask detailed questions about the photo. And, yes, sometimes what we learn leads us to reject it.Still, reasonable people can disagree: One of our photographers recently entered a photo in a contest. It was rejected as being overprocessed; our editors, on the other hand, saw the same photo and thought it was OK. We published it. Were we right, or were the contest judges right? That’s a subject we can continue to discuss.“We ask ourselves, ‘Is this photo a good representation of what the photographer saw?’” Leen says. For us as journalists, that answer always must be yes.Thank you for reading National Geographic.",
"There is an underground city beneath Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union allocated a large budget to prepare for nuclear and other attacks. Under Tbilisi alone there are about 450 bunkers, one of which includes a huge control panel to provide communication with bunkers below other Georgian cities.I always wanted to witness and photograph this hidden part of Tbilisi. I knew the location of several of the bunkers, and my friends and I found others through our research. With a trained eye, it is not difficult to locate them. (See how Communist-era bunkers were transformed into museums in Albania.)After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the bunkers were abandoned, although some still require special permission to access. I am not making public their exact locations to prevent vandalism. Entering the bunkers is dangerous: Many are damaged and partially collapsed. Bats and stagnant water present other perils. I never knew what to expect. Preparation and special equipment were required to remain safe.Since these places are cloaked in darkness, I brought my own light and tried to capture the mysterious mood of these places during my voyage below Tbilisi.",
"In many former Eastern Bloc countries, wrecking balls and social progress took out hulking Communist buildings and militaristic Cold War structures after the Berlin Wall fell. In Tirana, the mountain-framed capital city of Albania, the government and local artists have chosen more vibrant and unusual ways to blaze their way out of years of dictatorship and economic depression.Crumbling, gray Ottoman-era mansions have been painted in shades of Creamsicle orange and rain slicker yellow; drab, Stalinist mid-rises serve as outsized canvases for jewel-toned Cubist abstracts or rainbow stripes. Much of the credit goes to former mayor Edi Rama, a painter-turned-politician (now Albania’s prime minister), who began a citywide beautification effort in 2000 that saw artists decking out building facades and city workers planting 55,000 trees and bushes in public spaces.“When colors came out everywhere, a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people,” said Rama in a TED Talk. “It revived hope that had been lost in my city.” Residents and tourists now use the rainbow-tinted edifices as selfie backdrops, and the government claimed the paint helped crime go down and local pride go up.Public art and paint aren’t the only forces moving this small Balkan capital beyond the oppression of the Communist era. Around Tirana, history museums fill former military bunkers and galleries dot neighborhoods once reserved for party officials.Until a decade or two ago, the most common souvenir you’d tote home from Tirana would probably have been an alabaster bunker ashtray, not a selfie taken in front of a colorful building. The domed tchotchkes pay wry tribute to the more than 173,000 bunkers (bunkerët) that once dotted Albania and its capital, bleak reminders of the 1941-1985 reign of dictator Enver Hoxha.(These Brutalist monuments salute a country that no longer exists.)Brutal to his citizens and notoriously paranoid, Hoxha believed neighboring countries Greece and Yugoslavia as well as former Soviet allies wanted to invade Albania. So from the 1960s through the early 1980s, he erected thousands of concrete fortresses around the country, ranging in size from two-person igloos to multi-room underground lairs. (For an idea of how pervasive the program was, see the recent documentary Mushrooms of Concrete.)Their construction further isolated the country and drained its finances and energy, leaving it one of Europe’s poorest countries. In the end, all that cement mixing was for nothing. “Hoxha spent billions of dollars for his dream of bunkering (bunkerizimi) every inch of Albania, enslaving and bringing an entire population to the brink of starvation,” says Admirina Peçi, a local journalist and historian. “But history has proven that the real risk of attacks was zero.”Today, though many bunkers have collapsed or been destroyed, hundreds remain, repurposed as animal barns; painted to resemble flowers in city suburbs; or, for teenagers, used as secluded hideouts to smooch. At some of Albania’s Adriatic coast resorts (about an hour west of Tirana), cement domes have morphed into food stands and changing rooms. Elesio Resort in Golem has turned its basement bunker into a spa; its domed roof, jutting up into the hotel restaurant, is lined with shelves that hold morning breakfast buffets.The most elaborate repurposing of these doomsday structures is Bunk’Art, a pair of history museums/art galleries filling two underground nuclear shelters built for Hoxha and his allies. Amid stark, windowless rooms and thick steel doors meant to protect party leaders from a nuclear blast, video installations, artifacts, and contemporary art delve into 20th-century Albanian history, including the Fascist Italian occupation from 1939-1944 as well as the Communist era.“It was becoming increasingly difficult to come across symbols of Hoxha’s regime. The only pieces of Communism were the thousands of bunkers scattered all over the country like concrete mushrooms,” said Carlo Bollino, an Italian-born, Albanian-based journalist who helped to found Bunk’Art in 2014. “A museum inside bomb bunkers seemed like a formula for showing history.”Both Bunk’Arts—one on the outskirts of Tirana, the other in the city center—hold an eclectic mix of history and art. An exhibit about the overemphasis on sports in Hoxha’s time slyly recreates a school gym; a basketball hoop holds a bust of the mustached dictator. At the entrance to downtown’s Bunk’Art 2, vintage photos of Albanians murdered by the Communist government line the domed entry as a soundtrack of their relatives’ remembrances plays.“Albanians have a strong relationship with retelling the past,” says Driant Zeneli, a Tirana video artist with work at Bunk’Art. Since creatives have only been able to express themselves freely since Communism fell in 1990, Zeneli feels like the community is making up for lost time. “Today Albania is a place of big ideas and energy, with artists translating the transition from a long dictatorship. It’s the gaze of a generation understanding its past and looking at the future.”Some activists and younger Albanians believe more needs to be done to preserve Cold War military structures, and to use them to recount a period in history marked by forced labor camps and brutal interrogations by the Sigurimi secret police.“There is no memory politics, no desire by Albania’s ministry of culture to deal with the Communist legacy or strategic thinking about what to do with the bunkers,” says Ivo Krug, co-founder of Tek Bunkeri, a Tirana-based NGO working to repurpose bunkers and revive rural communities. The group turned one cement tunnel outside of Tirana into an arts and culture pop-up in 2017 and hopes to help carve an interactive history museum out of a massive underground shelter in Gjirokastra, a UNESCO World Heritage city in southern Albania.Though some critics claim repurposing or painting over Cold War structures is a cheap fix for crumbling infrastructure (or a white-washing of Albania’s dark history), these creative changes have brought optimism and forward motion to a city once considered dull and economically depressed. Punch-bright walls in older neighborhoods like Pazari i Ri and Ali Demi now draw tourists, and street murals, forbidden during Communist times, have bloomed all over town.“Color was almost nonexistent in the public space [until the 2000s], but day by day, giant leaves, geometrics, dots and words appeared on building façades,” says local artist Ledia Konstandini, who has chronicled the changing city with illustrations and photos. “At the beginning, they looked out of place. But the more decorated facades there were, the more natural they looked. People overcame fear and boundaries with color, and it has become part of our urban identity.”Just off the city’s central Skanderberg Square (a tribute to the 15th-century hero who fought off the Turkish), the National Gallery of Arts weaves together Albania’s past and present. Contemporary works—sound sculptures, photo journalism—keep company with a large display of “Socialist Realism” paintings and drawings.See these forgotten Soviet bunkers around the world.Mid 20th-century artists, “guided” by the oppressive government, made idealized images of farms and happy peasants. Pretty pictures—Kolë Idromino’s villagers in elaborate folk costumes, Isuf Sulovari’s head-scarved female factory workers—suggest a bygone Socialist utopia at odds with the exhibits at Bunk’Art.A few blocks south, there’s another crumbling symbol of Albania’s Communist past, the Pyramid of Tirana. Built in 1988 as a tribute to Hoxha, the hulking cement and glass behemoth had fallen into disrepair in recent decades. But a futuristic renovation of the Brutalist behemoth started in February. It will see the space turned into a STEM school and cultural center, complete with an exterior slide.Like most changes to historic spaces in Tirana, the pyramid’s potential redo has created controversy. “Many people consider these things as makeup, like lipstick on an old face,” says Konstandini. “As an artist, I believe in urban language, and I think Tirana is gaining a new vocabulary to express its life and temperament.”Jennifer Barger is a senior editor at National Geographic travel.

"This large winged sculpture in Podgarić, Croatia, holds a crypt with the remains of hundreds of Partisan soldiers who died while being treated at nearby hospitals.Hundreds of bizarre futuristic monuments appear out of place jutting from the varied landscape of the former Yugoslavia—ghostlike echoes of a country that no longer exists. Stretching from present-day Croatia and Slovenia bordering the Adriatic coast, through the jagged peaks of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, until sloping down into Serbia and Macedonia, the bold abstract artworks built during the 1960s and 1970s were intended to spread their country's ideals and values to the masses across all the land.To understand what these relics of the past mean today, photographer Sylvain Heraud traveled to the republics that emerged from the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. "The idea of my work is to highlight these monuments and ask the question whether their messages have endured over time," explains Heraud.The unique style of the Yugoslavian monuments—which looked to Western modernism for inspiration—is objectively much different from the representative art found in its Soviet neighbors. After all, Yugoslavia was an anomaly: a socialist state that allowed free travel to the West and promoted “self-management,” unlike the repressive Soviet Union. Ruling powers around the world build monuments in important public places to promote a particular narrative in an accessible message to the passing crowds. Different symbols in public art reflect the particular style of past or current regimes, and taking notice uncovers layers of history of a place hiding in plain sight.Physically and conceptually heavy, the bold concrete creations convey powerful visual impact near sites of unthinkable tragedies during World War Two. Since then, revolutionary Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito led the multicultural society until his death in 1980, trying to suppress any lingering animosities from the war. He wanted the monuments to recognize that war laid a foundation for Yugoslavia to exist in its current form, without appearing to favor one group of the heterogeneous society over another. These monuments were intended to present a common thread to tie everyone to the great country of Yugoslavia.Heraud's photographs emphasize their shared connection by capturing the monuments at night in exactly the same manner. “I wanted to lose the notions of scale and size, to concentrate myself on the monuments themselves, as symbols. I brought lamps [to light up each place,] the white light allows me to remain neutral. We can however guess the green environment (trees) that gives a conductive thread on all images.”Stainless steel soars more than 30 feet out of the ground, with stylized human faces to tell the story of a small group of Partisan soldiers attempting to rebel against Axis forces in Ostra, Serbia.Far from a simplified representation, Heraud’s series shines light on each monument’s uniqueness. As much as Tito tried, the region’s strategic position historically at the crossroads of great powers makes it difficult for only one narrative to suffice. When he died in 1980, political upheavals and unresolved issues among the various people caused the country’s ultimate destruction through bitter ethnic wars.These conceptual monuments, originally meant to usher in a utopian future, live on. Some people nostalgically consider these souvenirs of a better time, while others find them painful reminders of an unspeakable past. That’s why the monuments today live in various states of disrepair. Some of the memorials have caretakers and house small museums, while others lay in ruin.These incredible memorials offer any visitor a glimpse into the former Yugoslavia’s remarkable history. It may take effort to get to know the complicated region, let alone find the monuments, but the effort is definitely worth it. These monuments form the very essence of Yugoslavia.",
"Sydney artist Fintan Magee painted this water diviner searching for an elusive spring on a grain silo in Barraba, a rural town in the Australian state of New South Wales. It’s one of many street art-style projects that have recently gone up in agricultural areas across the country.Life isn’t easy in rural Australia, where your nearest neighbor might be hundreds of miles away, and it could be years between each rainfall. But farmers in southeastern Australia have had it particularly rough over the past couple of years, with crippling droughts forcing many to sell off their livestock to survive or even walk away from their agricultural businesses for good.In southwest Queensland, the cotton- and sheep-farming community of Thallon (population 257) is one of many Australian outback towns now at risk of being wiped off the map by climate and population changes. Passenger railway services to and from the town—located roughly 355 miles southwest of Brisbane—stopped in the 1990s, hastening its decline.(Related: Eyeball stunning natural wonders across Australia.)“By 2015 Thallon was on its knees, so we got the community together to see what we could do to reinvigorate the town,” says Leanne Brosnan, secretary of the Thallon Progress Association. Ideas the group helped to implement included a statue of a six-foot-tall hairy-nosed wombat in a park and, in 2017, a massive mural covering four 98-foot-tall grain silos opposite the town campground.Brisbane artists Joel Fergie and Travis Vinson covered a grain silo in Thallon, Queensland, with an image of local farm animals and birds at sunset.Dubbed “The Watering Hole,” the outsize mural by Brisbane street artists Joel Fergie and Travis Vinson depicts a fiery sunset over a landscape dotted with sheep, rainbow-hued rosella parrots, and a scarred tree—a nod to the region’s indigenous community, which strips bark to make weapons. It took the artists—who go by The Zookeeper (Fergie) and Drap (Vinson)—21 days and 500 cans of spray paint to execute the piece, working from the basket of a long-armed crane.Their sky-scraping efforts were worth it: “The Watering Hole” has been a lifeline for the community, and it was named the best work of public art at the inaugural Australian Street Art Awards in 2019.“Thallon wasn’t a tourist destination at all before,” says Brosnan. “The mural now entices visitors to come out here and maybe spend a few bucks at the local pub. It has given locals a bit of hope for the future.”Thallon’s mural is one of 30 larger-than-life works that have been painted on silos all across Australia over the past five years. Some go up on still-working agricultural sites, others decorate abandoned storehouses. Dotted along six driving trails in five states, the enormous paintings form a kind of open-air gallery crawl. It’d total 4,700 miles if all the silos were linked together—and someone had a lot of gas in their car tank.The idea of emblazoning outsized farm storage buildings with oversized art began in Western Australia in 2015, when a cultural non-profit called FORM hired well-known street artists Phlegm and HENSE to paint a series of linked silos in the town of Northam, 62 miles northeast of Perth in the Wheatbelt region. Phlegm covered one end of the 118-foot-high block with wry, black-and-white portraits of early aviators and balloonists; HENSE plastered colorful, abstract forms on the other.Designed as a pilot project to bring art to rural regions, the stunt was a hit. It ignited a movement, with other towns in Western Australia’s Wheatbelt and beyond angling to get their own beautified silo—and to bring visitors and revitalization with it. Cultural grants and private commissions would fill rural areas with the kind of buzzy, bright art usually found in downtown alleys and warehouse-y neighborhoods. An added bonus? From Australia’s wide-open back roads, the silos could be seen for miles around.“We didn’t set out to create a trail, but there was so much interest that we quickly realized there was a need for a coordinated approach,” says Rhianna Pezzaniti, project manager of what would become known as the Public Silo Trail connecting six painted silos in southwestern Western Australia.Guido van Helten painted four generations of a local farm family on a silo in Brim, Victoria.Joining forces with a grain-growers cooperative, the CBH Group, which donated its in-use silos as canvases, FORM worked with rural communities to map out a driving route that made logistical sense for road trippers—while stimulating tourism in declining towns.But this isn’t a sort of Picasso goes to the outback—these works tend to have hyper-local themes, and they’re often, but not always, created by Aussies. Artists consult townspeople to come up with imagery that suits the locale, from Melbourne artist Rone’s portrait of a farming couple on a Lascelles, Victoria silo and New York City artists Yok and Sheryo’s giant ruby seadragon decorating a silo in seaside Albany, Western Australia.“People in the country don’t tend to have time for fancy art galleries, so we wanted to create artworks that reflected them,” says Shaun Hossack, founder and creative director of Melbourne art agency Juddy Roller, which has helped put 17 murals up on silos across the country, including a young girl playing in a wheat field by Cam Scale in Kimba, South Australia, and a multi-generational quartet of hat- and ballcap-wearing farmers by Guido van Helten in the Victorian town of Brim. (Van Helton, known for photo-realistic portraits, is something of an international silo star, with works on towering structures in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and Jacksonville, Florida, too.)While painting silos isn’t a huge stretch for street artists accustomed to large-scale projects, they do face challenges—Cirque du Soleil-like scaffolding, paint that dries slowly due to moisture or wind, uncomfortable weather. “Guido painted the Brim silo at Christmastime, when it’s stinking hot,” says Hossack. “He had to get up before dawn, work until around 11 a.m, then go back in the evening.”While the silo trails may be far apart geographically, it’s easy to get a picture of what they look like—and where to find them—thanks to two “grey nomads” from Western Australia.Setting out in their 1992 Toyota Coaster in late 2018 for a fishing trip, retirees Annette and Eric Green detoured to see the painted silo in Tumby Bay, South Australia. They were so taken with Argentinian artist Martin Ron’s image of two boys jumping into the ocean that the couple hit the road to see more art.Heesco Khosnaran painted a rural scene on a silo in Grenfell, New South Wales.“After we finished our fishing trip and were deciding where to go next, I thought, well, there’s some silos in Victoria–let’s go there,” says Annette. Frustrated by a lack of online information about the silos, Annette created a Facebook page to guide other roadtrippers and launched the Australian Silo Art Trail website in 2019 to document the trails on a national level.“It has taken us to so many places we never would have thought to visit,” she says, adding that the economic impacts of the art are also being felt beyond the silo towns. “There are often a couple of towns between each silo. That means more people stopping for fuel or a meat pie, which helps to support the small businesses keeping some of these towns alive.”And while most of the regions with silo art weren’t affected by the recent bushfires, many of the farming communities with the murals remain in the grip of drought. This means that in places like tiny Grenfell, 224 miles west of Sydney, a silo mural commissioned by a local grain company owner hasn’t only served to beautify the town, it’s been good for commerce. “It’s given the regional economy a sorely needed boost,” says Auburn Carr, a tourism officer for the region. The number of visitors to the town has climbed 54 percent since it got a silo in 2019.The decked-out silos have also helped propel other rural public art and development across Australia. In Katanning—a farming town in Western Australia— FORM commissioned artists to festoon electrical transformer boxes and building walls with colorful birds, dogs, and Arabic lettering in 2017. A year later, the stylish Premier Mill Hotel opened in a converted 1891 flour mill.It’s a similar story in other silo towns across the country, with increased tourism helping struggling businesses stay afloat and giving some locals the confidence to open new ventures. Take the Store Café in Pingrup, Western Australia, which was started by a group of local women in the spring of 2018, around the same time the town’s silo was painted. “Before the café opened, there was nothing in Pingrup—you had to travel 31 miles to get milk and bread” says Pezzaniti. “Now there’s this hip spot travelers can stop for a homecooked meal.”Annette Green’s website also features more than 60 painted water towers, which include designs from humpback whales in mid-breach (Slade Point, Queensland) to Aboriginal pieces depicting spiritually significant wildlife (Larrakia, Northern Territory). “Some of these artworks are just as big and impressive as the works on the silos,” she says. “Many are located near the silos, so seeking them out adds another dimension to the journey.”It’s all inspiring return visits by day trippers and artists alike. Fergie and Vinson got to know the locals in Thallon so well while painting “The Watering Hole,” that they’ve returned to do additional murals—including a portrait of a local man on a pillar underneath a railway bridge. In true street-artist fashion, the pair stealthily created it in the wee hours as a surprise for the town.“We got busted by a local in the middle of the night, but when he realized what we were doing he was like, ‘oh cool, carry on,’” says Fergie, who became so enamored of the laid-back town that he plans to marry his girlfriend at its pub when the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions allow it. “There are about 20 pillars under that bridge,” he adds, “so we’ll definitely be back.”",
"Go for the ultimate natural wonder, the Great Barrier Reef, but stay for these other irresistible stops.Take a break from hiking Lord Howe Island to enjoy a boat ride around Ball's Pyramid.Lord Howe Island is a tiny dot in the Tasman Sea, roughly a third of the way between Australia and New Zealand. Look for massive basalt mountains that rise straight up out of the ocean, with craggy cliffs covered with greenery for a definite South Pacific feel. The hiking is tremendous and often quite strenuous. You also can explore dramatic cliffs with whirling seabirds that rise on furious currents of air. Take a boat out to see Ball’s Pyramid, a 6.4-million-year-old shard of razor-sharp rock that rises straight out of the ocean.Tolmer Falls is one of many waterfalls and watering holes found in Litchfield National Park.Fast-flowing, towering waterfalls and rich, red rock canyons that look like northern Arizona or southern Utah make up Litchfield National Park. Located a short drive south of the capital of Darwin, Litchfield features lush watering holes where you can take a dip and admire ribbons of water tumbling over cliffs lined with deep green trees and orange-red rock. The park offers a series of great hikes that take you through glorious woodlands and past creeks and on to lovely pools and waterfalls.The beaches and verdant hikes around Wineglass Bay are well worth the effort of getting there.Take a breathtaking mountain hike surrounded by peaks of pink granite, combined with one of Australia’s prettiest white-sand beaches, in Freycinet National Park. Freycinet offers some of Tasmania’s most rewarding hikes, with trails for just about every ability.

The islands (there are 74 of them, all in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef) are great for walking and exploring. You’ll find lonely, deserted beaches and some of Australia’s oldest archaeological sites. But the best way to appreciate the majesty of the blue bays and brilliant white sandbars is by plane.This distinctive orange "beehive" is one of many remarkable features in the Bungle Bungle Range.The Bungle Bungles (also known as Purnululu) not only have an awesome name, but they’re one of the most remarkable features on the continent: massive rocks with black and orange stripes that rise like giant knobs from the surrounding outback in the far northwestern part of the state. Indigenous peoples have lived here for centuries, but hardly any non-indigenous folks knew about the region until the 1980s. There are wonderful walks to see hidden gorges and pools. It’s open only in the dry season, usually April to November.These eye-grabbing rock formations make up the Twelve Apostles along the Great Ocean Road.The Twelve Apostles is a magnificent rock formation found on the Great Ocean Road that has been pummelled by rain, wind, and furious ocean waves for millions of years. The constant attack has worn away sections of the limestone cliffs, leaving towering rock formations offshore that march along the coast in a dramatic golden fashion.North of Adelaide lay the colorful rock walls of Flinders Range as well as surrounding indigenous cultures to explore.The Flinders Ranges are just a few hours’ drive north of Adelaide. You’ll find towering rock walls with wide bands of pale white and ochre-colored rocks that positively glow in the light of sunrise and sunset, as well as spectacular gorges carved out over 800 million years. You’ll also get to experience indigenous culture that dates back 45,000 years. A scenic flight is a great way to see the area, or try a four-wheel-drive tour to experience the terrain on an up-close basis.",
"Brigton Beach is one of Melbourne's most iconic spots.Phillip Island, 142 kilometers south of Melbourne, is known for its penguin parade. Dubbed as the world's smallest parade, this event allows visitors to catch a glimpse of the smallest species of penguins in their natural habitat. These penguins waddle up to the beach and into their burrows after a day of fishing at the sea. Phillip Island is also known for seals and koalas.The Great Ocean Road or the B100 is Victoria's defining drive and in no small part thanks to the 12 Apostles (though there are only seven standing now). These are rock stacks formed by erosion along this fantastic coastal drive. While the Great Ocean Road drive can be done in a day, it is best to take two days to explore this road. A helicopter ride over the 12 Apostles is highly recommended. Start at Torquay (105 kilometers from Melbourne) and end at Port Campbell. Torquay to Port Campbell is 187 kilometers along the B100.The Kinglake National Park is 74 kilometers north of Melbourne nestled on the slopes of the Great Dividing Range. The 232 square kilometer park is a popular place for hiking and camping. The Mason Falls attracts the most visitors because of the fern forests around the falls and its nice picnic area. Wildlife, though elusive, is present in the form of wallabies, kangaroos, wombats and echidna. Affected by the 2009 wildfires, many plants that adapted to fire are now flourishing. Spring (September to November) is best for wildflowers and winter (December to February) is when mosses, fungi and lichen crop up.The Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton and the surrounding gardens are in the heart of Melbourne. The building became the first in Australia to be put on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Built for the Great International Exhibitions in Melbourne in 1880 and 1888, the building and gardens were later chosen as the venue for the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament of Australia on May 9, 1901. Today there are ongoing exhibitions held inside the building and daily tours starting at 2 p.m. if the building is not specifically being used for an event. The Carlton Gardens are also on the World Heritage List. Take time to explore the beautiful Victorian style landscaping and the profusion of trees and plant species present within, some of which are extremely rare.Located just 50 kilometers from Melbourne, Yarra Valley is a popular wine region with more than 50 cellar doors. Besides sampling wine, the cafes attached to the cellar doors often have fresh seasonal produce on their menus. Popular activities to partake in are a hot air balloon ride over Yarra Valley's scenic landscape during sunrise, cruising down the country lanes in a classic convertible and enjoying a relaxed luncheon in the wineries' restaurants. A visit to Yarra Valley can be combined with a ride on the famous Puffing Billy steam train that takes visitors through the magnificent Dandenong Ranges.The Flinders Street Station is an iconic Melbourne landmark. Completed in 1910, it is constructed in the French Renaissance style of architecture and stands out amongst the glass and steel skyscrapers that today surround it. An urban myth is that the designs for the Victoria Terminus (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus) in Mumbai and the Flinders Street Station in Melbourne were switched. Another legend is that a ghost named George roams around the station.The Central Business District (CBD) in Melbourne doesn't really shut down after business hours as many restaurants and bars stay open late into the night. Usually 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. are closing times but the Loch and Key on Franklin Street stays open until 5 a.m. It is a little tricky to find because it is a pub that is hidden inside a bar called the Captain Melville, the city's oldest pub. Access to Loch and Key is via a rickety staircase behind a bookcase in the Captain Melville.Sovereign Hill, 116 kilometers to the west of Melbourne, can be called a "dynamic" museum. Set in what used to be a gold prospecting area, this open-air community museum is deeply entrenched in gold-rush history. Here one can interact with the dressed-up actors, pan for gold in the Red Hill Gully Creek—which is peppered with fine alluvial gold—or take a horse drawn carriage around town.Check out the action and the crowds every Friday and Saturday night at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the Australian Foot Ball (AFL) Australian Rules football season. Locally called "footy," this is a Melbourne highlight and is often played during winter so it pays to dress in layers. The fans put on as much of a show as the game itself. Because it can get boisterous at times, only low strength alcohol is on sale at the MCG.It is exciting to delve into the hustle and bustle of the Queen Victoria Market—the Southern Hemisphere's biggest open-air market. Within the market are stores and stalls selling fresh produce, fruits and vegetables, artisan cheeses and meats including kangaroo and crocodile. There are speciality cafes and coffee shops. It is a place to eat, shop, explore as one discovers iconic food halls and heritage sheds where the banter is as fresh as the produce.",
"The exact number of military bunkers strewn across Albania is a matter of debate. Depending on who you ask, the tally ranges from around 175,000 to some 750,000 of the burrowed, cement-and-steel, pod-like lookouts meant to protect this country on the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe. The reason for this discrepancy is cryptically sinister: The mushroom-shaped cabins were built with Cold War secrecy, in the 1970s and 1980s, by a paranoia-fueled regime. That was then. Today, three decades removed from Communist dictator Enver Hoxha, who ruled from 1944 to 1985, citizens see the omnipresent bunkers as painful reminders of a difficult past, to be sure. However, Albanians, resourceful by nature, are flipping the script, and giving the objects new lives as restaurants, bars, cafés, and even museums.From the air, the turreted bunkers look like braille characters spilled across the landscape—embossed dots scattered in every corner of the country. The structures hide in valleys, blossom from mountainsides, and sprout along shorelines, slapped over and over by the Adriatic Sea. (A commonly used figure estimates 2.2 bunkers per square mile. Albania is nearly half the size of West Virginia.) They come in an array of sizes. A few dozen acted as command centers with mazes of rooms to wait out any war. Many served as tiny one- or two-person sentry posts. Nominally, the “pillboxes” were constructed to keep an eye on an ever-changing list of potential exterior enemies. The reality: Their raison d’être was to solidify a collective, internal, national fear.“The vast number of bunkers shows how militarized and paranoid Albania had become during Hoxha’s rule,” says Vjeran Pavlaković, a Cultural Studies professor at Croatia’s University of Rijeka. Pavlaković focuses on collective memory in the Balkans. “Rather than invest in education and economic development, the regime allocated resources to isolate itself. However, post-communist Albania has proven itself ready to embrace bold interventions to deal with this architectural legacy, preserve heritage, and innovatively use an otherwise idle resource.”Examples of that innovative repurposing can be found all over the country. There's a bunker-cum-tattoo parlor in Shkodër, a hamburger joint in Kavajë, and a 20-room hotel on the coast in Golem. In Tirana, Albania's capital, two museums have acted as standard-bearers for the conversion concept. Bunk’Art, Hoxha’s atomic bunker, received more than 70,000 guests during the first two months it was open in 2014. The exhibition space, which includes Hoxha’s chamber, shines a light on “the daily lives of Albanians during the regime's years.” About a 20-minute drive away, in the city center, Bunk’Art 2 was opened in 2016. It’s 24 rooms served as the Interior Ministry’s atomic shelter.“Bunk'Art 1 and Bunk'Art are places of memory in which both Albanians and tourists can scour the secrets of a regime and revive the past and the suffering of a people,” says Carlo Bollino, Bunk’Art’s general curator. “[To] transform as a tourist attraction … is also a way to compensate the country for the monetary, political cost and in terms of human lives paid for [the bunkers’] construction.”Based in Zagreb, Alex Crevar writes for National Geographic Travel, among other publications.

"North Korean soldiers stand guard at the demilitarized zone which separates the two Koreas.The armistice line meanders in an east-west fashion across Korea, connecting what Koreans call the East Sea with Gyeonggi Bay, 148 miles (238 kilometers) away off the peninsula's west coast.Although it approximates the positions held by communist and U.S.-led U.N. forces for most of the last two-thirds of the war, the MDL is not the same line that had divided Korea before North invaded South in June, 1950.That line was the 38th parallel, whose origins as modern Korea's first intra-national boundary can be traced back to the final hours of World War II, when officials from the U.S. War and State Departments were preparing to negotiate with the Soviet Union over how Japanese-occupied Korea would be administered following Japan's surrender.Future U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, then a colonel on General George Marshall's staff, and fellow Army staffer Col. Charles "Tic" Bonesteel were assigned with identifying a line of control that both the U.S. and the Soviets could agree to.Time was of the essence: the Soviets had just entered the war against Japan, and American officials worried that they would rush in to occupy the entire Korean peninsula before the U.S., whose nearest troops were still 600 miles (966 kilometers) away on Okinawa, could establish its own presence on the mainland.Rusk knew that the 38th parallel "made no sense economically or geographically"—Korea, in fact, had enjoyed unity and a high degree of geographic continuity for the better part of a millennium—but this was now the Cold War. "Military expediency" had to rule the day. Korea, it was thought, would be divided only temporarily.Rusk later recalled the experience in his 1991 memoir, As I Saw It:During a meeting on August 14, 1945, the same day as the Japanese surrender, [Bonesteel] and I retired to an adjacent room late at night and studied intently a map of the Korean peninsula. Working in haste and under great pressure, we had a formidable task: to pick a zone for the American occupation. Neither Tic nor I was a Korea expert, but it seemed to us that Seoul, the capital, should be in the American sector. We also knew that the U.S. Army opposed an extensive area of occupation. Using a National Geographic map, we looked just north of Seoul for a convenient dividing line but could not find a natural geographical line. We saw instead the thirty-eighth parallel and decided to recommend that ... [Our commanders] accepted it without too much haggling, and surprisingly, so did the Soviets.Thus was the Korean peninsula first divided. Early attempts to merge the two occupation zones back into a single, united Korea failed. And by late summer of 1948 the independent and increasingly antagonistic states of North and South Korea had been established.Within two years, the two new nations would be in a war that eventually left 2.5 million Koreans dead, injured, or reported missing. And, 60 years later, still divided.",
"For days up there on the Plain of Jars I’d been trying to capture an image, find a metaphor, crystallize an idea that could convey what it means for Laos to have been one of the most heavily bombed nations in history and then to have gone on and somehow found a future. Finally, right there on a busy main street of Phonsavan, the provincial capital, I found it: a giant pile of bomb casings left over from the American bombing campaign in Laos, a stupendous and futile torrent of airborne destruction. And just beyond the junk heap of weaponry, a new ATM machine. Bright blue and gleaming white, this beckoning pagoda of money dwarfed the rusting debris of a half-forgotten war. After inspecting the bomb casings, I walked over to the ATM, stuck in my debit card, and pulled out one million kip, about $120. All those 50,000-kip notes spewing out of the machine told a new story about Laos, where an age of bombs has given way to an age of money.Once, here in Xiangkhouang Province, children grew up barely seeing the sun. People spent years hiding in caves and tunnels. Now Phonsavan is so busy it has traffic lights with digital displays showing how many seconds pedestrians have to cross the street—not that you need cross the street to find a bank, a restaurant, a market full of fresh fruit and vegetables, a shop selling running shoes. Along with the fabled megalithic urns on the Plain of Jars, whose purpose still mystifies archaeologists, the debris of the American air war that lasted from 1964 to 1973 has become part of a public relations campaign to attract tourists: That heap of bomb casings is displayed in front of the local tourism office.With its undulating hills and grassy flatlands, the Plain of Jars in some places resembles a giant golf course. The sand traps here were made by falling bombs, millions of which exploded. Millions more did not, creating a permanent danger, especially to those entrepreneurial Laotians who make money salvaging valuable metal from unexploded bombs.“Welcome to Mr. Phet Napia Making the Spoon and Bracelet,” announces the ad on Phet Napia’s house in the village of Ban Naphia. In his backyard foundry Phet melts aluminum from ammunition shells and locally collected metals. He then pours it into a mold to create bomb-shaped key rings as well as eating utensils. Local restaurants all seem to have forks, spoons, and chopsticks made of war-era scrap metal.The fruits of Phet’s industry are on show: a new house, a satellite TV, electric lights. Like many Laotians, Phet is an artisan with a flair for entrepreneurship, but he’s still trying to get his mind around the idea that in a market economy the costs don’t stop when you pay for something. “You get 60 channels on it,” he said as we admired his satellite dish, “but you must pay for the electricity.” His mobile phone helps attract new business, “but even after you purchase it, you must pay to talk into it also.”Laos, with a population of fewer than seven million, now has almost five million mobile phones. At Ban Pak-Ou, a northern village on the Mekong River, fishermen stand motionless in their pirogues silhouetted in the amber light, the water around them glimmering like burnished bronze. It’s like peering back through the centuries, except that each man is chatting into his cell phone as he fishes.Vientiane, the capital, once was a scruffy town. Now it’s a scruffy city with 12-story buildings. Once silence prevailed, punctuated by the sounds of falling rain, babies crying, people laughing, monks chanting. Today everything happens in a soupy buzz of air conditioners clattering, generators buzzing, motorbikes whining, horns blaring.The country’s economy is growing by nearly 8 percent a year. The flag of the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, with its Soviet-style hammer and sickle, still flies alongside the national flag, but the government’s leaders, whose role was once to enable the Vietnamese to pursue their Marxist-Leninist war of national unification, now play a different part: as enablers in the creation of a Southeast Asian free-market zone. Laos aims to graduate from the ranks of the least developed countries on the UN’s list by 2020.In Laos the rich are getting richer, and even in the remotest areas, among the humblest people, I encountered an access to possibilities of the outside world previously unimaginable. Near the Vietnamese border in central Laos, I saw a young man heading home on his motorbike with a satellite dish cupped under his arm. In mountain villages I saw flocks of schoolchildren in their white-and-blue uniforms. I also saw refurbished places of worship wherever I went—Buddhist temples, to be sure, but also many animist shrines and a few Christian churches. You still see monks in their saffron robes everywhere, only now they carry computer bags.The Mekong still flows past Vientiane broad as history, but the riverfront has been transformed. Once a series of mud banks and sandpits, it’s now an inviting esplanade almost two miles long, complete with exercise machines and jogging paths—and parking spaces for all those family sedans and SUVs. Every evening brings a throng: the lovers, the jugglers, the laughing children, the break-dancers. Musicians perform, and exercise gurus offer classes, as the immense disk of the setting tropical sun turns itself into a blurry horizontal streak, and the hubbub is illuminated by the neon tubes on the vendors’ pushcarts and the shifting beams of motorcycle headlamps.Like most things in Laos, this riverside park in Vientiane tells a deeper story. A triumph of humanist city planning—which has refocused life on the river, the open space, and the sky—the esplanade is actually a massive levee protecting the city from flooding. Who built it is also revealing: It was funded largely by a loan from South Korea. The countries of Asia now provide more useful assistance than the Occidental powers ever did.During all the time France and the United States predominated in Laos, neither country built a bridge across the Mekong. Today six great bridges span the river. One is at Thakhek, where the transit distance across Laos between the growing economies of Thailand and Vietnam is shortest, only 90 miles. In Thakhek I could see Thailand through my hotel room window while watching Vietnam Idol on TV.One morning in Vientiane I found a motorcycle club had filled the lobby of my hotel. “We’re on a joyride from Malaysia,” one biker politely explained—a 2,600-mile round trip. Another morning, this time in Louangphabang, I awoke to find the street outside crammed with newly arrived cars. Every one had a Chinese license plate. While those affluent bikers from Kuala Lumpur were heading north, affluent Chinese from Kunming were heading south, taking a Laotian vacation too. Just as the domino theory had predicted, Laos was being invaded, though by Peugeots and Harleys, not communist tanks and armored personnel carriers.This new era of peaceful interconnectedness has a human face everywhere you go. Its contours are also visible from the air. Flying over the Mekong from Savannakhet, you see another of those bridges conveying people and products into and out of Laos. Just upstream from it you also see skyscraper-high pylons carrying the electricity Laos exports across the river. Once when I flew out of Louangphabang, bomb craters caught my eye. Now there are other gouges—sand traps at the new golf course South Koreans have built.Decades ago when I stood on the riverbank in Vientiane, I pondered a question I knew I’d never be able to answer. How could seemingly rational people—Americans like me—imagine they could win the war in Vietnam by subjecting Laos to such indiscriminate destruction? When I wrote that a secret war was being fought in Laos, it made headlines around the world. In truth the U.S. military intervention in Laos, which began in the 1950s and lasted until 1974, never had been secret. All you had to do was ask any Laotian what was happening in the country. Every lady selling lotus blossoms in the morning market, every rickshaw boy offering you every imaginable enticement, knew all about not just the Ho Chi Minh Trail but the secret CIA army and the secret U.S. bombing of civilian populations. They also knew about the secret U.S. involvement in the opium trade.In 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive in neighboring Vietnam, I took a group taxi from the Mekong lowlands to the Bolovens Plateau. When the driver refused to go farther, I walked on. U.S. fighter bombers screeched overhead. On the horizon, along the tree line, I saw scurrying figures in camouflage. It was the only time during the war that I actually saw North Vietnamese troops—or U.S. warplanes dropping bombs. I was 23, yearning to uncover the truth.At Pakxong, a former French outpost for coffee growers, I wandered into an abandoned bar that could have been lifted from a Foreign Legion movie. A mural showed French planters taking their ease in the company of comely Laotian women. It was dark, and the only sign of life came from a small house next to the old French church. Inside the house I met a one-legged French priest drinking whiskey, his wooden leg propped up against a table. He filled a glass for me. He was reading a French translation of The Green Berets, a fictional tale of American derring-do in the jungle. “Is this what the Vietnam War is like?” he asked.For decades I’d wanted to see Pakxong again. I knew the priest would no longer be there, but I hadn’t expected that old Pakxong would be gone too. Following my 1968 foray, B-52s had carpet bombed it twice. Only the charred corner of one building remained. In its ruins I could make out faint initials: EDL. It had been the local office of the Laotian electric company.Pakxong had been obliterated, so why did returning there fill me with a kind of joy? It was the people—seemingly so peppy and happy—busily making a better life. Like Laos itself, Pakxong had been transformed from a battlefield into a marketplace. Where the French cantonment had been was now a sprawling market—chaotic, muddy, littered with plastic and organic refuse, but displaying anything you could want to sell or buy. What fascinated me most was the iron buffalo.Imagine you’re a Laotian peasant entrepreneur and you want everything you’ve seen on TV, but all you can afford is one thing. The iron buffalo is for you. Unlike a water buffalo, the iron buffalo can pump water as well as pull a plow, and it can light your house. It’s basically a multipurpose, portable internal combustion engine you can use to power almost anything. Connect it to your pump: You can grow dry-season crops. Connect it to your plow: You can quadruple the land you cultivate.Connect your iron buffalo to your cart, and a two-day walk to and from the nearest big market center becomes a morning’s expedition. That’s how I met Lan Keopanya. He had bolted a Volvo steering wheel to his iron buffalo, which he’d attached to his rubber-tired cart. He was cranking up his homemade pickup truck when we started talking. His village, he said, was 12 miles from the Pakxong market. “The journey costs four liters of diesel, but it’s worth it.” By getting there so much faster and more often, he could sell the coffee, fruit, and vegetables he grew at the best price. That day Lan was there buying plastic roofing for his new house. All his six children were or would be going to school, he told me proudly. A new road already reached his village. “We expect electricity within two years,” he said, as he began moving, hurrying to get that roofing up before the rains began.In parting, I asked what he wanted next. “We need our land to be cleared of bombs,” he said. “If it weren’t for the bombs, I could multiply my production.”During the bombing the mountain minorities of Laos suffered horribly. In the end it no longer mattered what side you took. The bombs didn’t distinguish between communists and anticommunists any more than they distinguished between soldiers and children. As the bombing accelerated, women used their expertise in embroidery and quilting to depict the catastrophe that fell out of the sky on them. With their images of bleeding children, burning crops, and terrified animals, their wall-size works of art are Laotian equivalents of Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica.”Keay Tcha, who told me she was 58, has lived for more than 17 years in Ban Na Oune, a Hmong refugee resettlement located near Louangphabang. She unfurled one of her peacetime masterpieces for me. It depicted an unlost paradise where sparkling waters ran, luxuriant plants flourished, and a Noah’s ark of exotic animals cavorted under a benign, multihued sun. In her hands a scrap of polka-dot cotton became a giraffe. A blue rag became a flowing stream. When I asked to see more, she told me she no longer worked on that scale. “The tourists don’t want big tapestries,” she said. “They want inexpensive embroidery they can take home in their hand baggage. So now I make many small things I can sell for a lower price.” She passed no value judgment on this latest transformation. She was surviving the peace as she’d survived the war, by recognizing what was necessary and doing it.One thing never changes in Laos: the heat of the journey. My quest for a cold drink brought me to Khenchan Khamsao’s convenience shop, on the north-south road to Louangphabang. A glass-doored, refrigerated drink dispenser beckoned, but it was her forest green trash container that got us talking. With its shapely pedestal (to keep away vermin), capacious bin, and secure lid, Khenchan’s trash container was graceful as well as utilitarian. “They make them from worn-out truck tires,” she explained. Like Phet Napia’s spoons and bracelets, the bin was an example of the Laotian genius for turning castoffs into useful objects.Her own life had been fashioned out of wreckage. She had come from a devastated section of Khammouan Province in central Laos, where many places remain so littered with unexploded ordnance (UXO) that it’s impossible to farm there. Because their land was unusable, she and her husband migrated to this wide spot in the road; 12 years later they epitomized the Laotian success story. Their shop occupied the ground floor of their new house. Her husband earned money as a construction worker on an irrigation project at Vangviang, 65 miles to the north. Their three children were studying in government schools—the young ones locally, the eldest in Vientiane.Khenchan and her family had lived the bombs, and now they were living the money. Money, they’d discovered, brought danger too. When I remarked that in the capital her son would get a better education, she replied, “No, that wasn’t why we sent him away. I sent him to Vientiane to get him away from the drug dealers.” A war on drugs started in 1989 with U.S. funding to eradicate opium. In 2006 Laos declared itself opium free, but as the economy boomed, an appetite for methamphetamines and other designer drugs took hold. The country is a major regional transit center for methamphetamines, heroin, and opium, which is again on the rise. As in America, rural areas have been especially hard hit.In Laos when the temperature goes below about 70 degrees, people start pulling on their coats and hats and lighting fires, which ignites the season of death. One New Year’s Eve three friends in Xiangkhouang Province went camping. It got cold that night, so they started a fire. One was killed right away when the bomb under their campsite exploded. Another was terribly maimed. I visited Yer Herr, the third victim, at his village home. The 18-year-old pulled off his shirt to show me 19 wounds on his back.In Yer’s village people had electricity, satellite TV, mobile phones. Each mother, wife, sister, and child, it seemed, also had a husband, a brother, or a little girl who had been maimed or killed by American bombs long after the end of the war. At the local high school, algebra was being taught on a blackboard. I couldn’t decipher the equations: Laotian teenagers in this remote village were learning mathematics more advanced than I’d been taught at their age in America. Back home, I showed a photo of that blackboard to a mathematician. “It analyzes the velocity of falling objects, like bombs,” he told me.Falling bombs still show up in dreams as well. “I live it inside me,” a world-renowned embroidery artist named Tiao Nithakhong Somsanith explained as I admired his use of gold thread to embroider Laotian silk with images of bombers. Tiao Nithakhong is helping revive the traditional arts in his country: classical dance, flower arrangement, costume design, orchestral music, and all kinds of weaving.Examining his exquisite work in a Louangphabang art gallery, I saw what I’d also seen in villagers’ handicrafts. Whether the material is bamboo or plastic, silk or synthetic fiber, weaving is the art at which the Laotian people most excel. Masters at turning every kind of material into something useful and beautiful, they weave palm fronds into baskets, bamboo into fish weirs. They weave silk and gold thread into beautiful women’s skirts called sin. On a bookshelf in my apartment in New York City, I keep a soccer ball woven from rattan, so perfect Buckminster Fuller might have invented it. I call it a soccer ball, but it’s the kind of ball in a game called katawthat Laotian youths play, using only their feet to cooperatively keep the ball in the air.In total the U.S. dropped more than 270 million cluster bomblets, or “bombies,” on Laos—more than one for every man, woman, and child in America at the time—as well as four million big bombs. The total weight of the bombs dropped was many times greater than the weight of the people living in Laos, which at the time had a population of perhaps two million. It worked out to as much as a ton of bombs per person.Periodically during the war Washington announced a “bombing halt,” but the munitions conveyor belt stretching from the stockpiles in the U.S. 8,000 miles across the Pacific could not be switched on and off. Bombs that did not fall on Vietnam were redirected to Laos. It was the world’s first supply-driven war—the pent-up munitions constantly generating a demand for their use. This mass production of airborne death had no quality control: Possibly 80 million of the bombies didn’t explode on impact and are still considered live. Up to 10 percent of all the big bombs also failed to explode.Laotians are a forgiving people, but as long as Laos remains riddled with explosives, nobody can forget, because forgetting can kill you. No matter how beautiful the scenery on the Plain of Jars, don’t forget and climb that nearby hill for a better view. The bombs there could maim you, if they don’t kill you. No matter how many times you’ve warned your kids, don’t forget and let them pick up those toylike capsules. Those little round bombies might disfigure or kill them.When the U.K.-based Mines Advisory Group held one of its classes about the dangers of UXO, schoolchildren listened as blast victims described their wounds—the psychological as well as the physical ones. Afterward the children were asked what they would say if they happened to meet some of the people who dropped the bombs. One little boy raised his hand. “I would tell him they should pay us money.”The U.S. Congress appropriated $12 million in 2014 for UXO removal. The new U.S. Embassy in Laos cost $145 million. This differential reflects U.S. priorities: a justifiable commitment to enhanced security for diplomats but also a near-total disregard for America’s historic responsibilities in Laos, where nearly every unexploded bomb was made in America and put there by Americans.The Laotian spirit has never been conquered—not by foreigners, not by the country’s own rulers. In the future the Laotian people will continue transforming whatever befalls them into works of art that are of practical, everyday use, because it is their great gift to perceive utility and beauty where others see only destruction and waste. During the air war Laotian craftsmen fashioned sleek motorized canoes from the discarded fuel pods of B-52 bombers—craft so distinctive that the Imperial War Museum in London acquired one for its collection.In our consumer age of fast food and nonbiodegradable refuse, I saw a Pringles can turned into a votive candle holder in the temple behind the Lane Xang Hotel in Vientiane. With the passage of time the temple has become bonded to the great, multirooted shade tree next to it. In addition to fast-food containers, this shrine incorporates stones plucked from the Mekong and auspicious tree roots into a unified, and poignant, expression of piety.Near the Louangphabang airport I encountered another example of how life in Laos perpetually finds a way to flourish. Vines twine around the dead wires of the antennas the CIA once used to transmit its secrets. This gift for life in no way undoes the harm done—and still being done.",
"Russian forces invaded Ukraine early on February 24, 2022, following an ominous yearlong military buildup and 30 years of Ukrainian independence after the Soviet Union fell apart in December 1991. The country of nearly 45 million people, assaulted from Belarus to the north, Russia to the east, and Russian-controlled Crimea in the south, is strategically positioned between Russia and the rest of Europe—including a swath of eastern European nations once under the Soviet sphere that have since joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an expansion of the Western defensive alliance that Russia views as a profound threat.Russian interventions in other former Soviet-bloc countries have led to several still disputed regions known as “frozen conflict” zones, including along Ukraine’s border. Ukraine has deep historical and cultural ties with Russia. But its efforts to throw off Russian domination in recent years have resulted in losses of Ukrainian lives and territory. This includes the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014, followed soon after by Russian seizures of large regions of eastern Ukraine—and, in early 2022, an assault on the entire country.Ukraine declares independence as the Soviet Union is collapsing in 1991.Ukraine joins a collaborative partnership with NATO. It gives up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for a signed agreement from Russia, the U.S., and the U.K. to protect its sovereignty.Disputed elections in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004 set off Georgia’s “Rose Revolution” and Ukraine’s “Orange Revolution” protesting corruption and Russian influence.Ukraine and Georgia begin to pursue membership in the NATO alliance. Later that summer, Russia backs separatists in breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Ukraine begins talks to form ties with the European Union.Protests erupt in Kyiv’s Maidan Square over the government’s withdrawal from EU talks. More than 100 protestors are killed; the Moscow-backed Ukrainian president flees to Russia.Russia seizes control of the Crimean Peninsula and annexes the territory.Pro-Russian separatists seize control of parts of Ukraine’s eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk; the 2015 Minsk II peace agreement quells some of the violence, but the region suffers more than 13,000 casualties by the end of 2021.In 2019 Ukraine passes a constitutional amendment to pursue NATO and EU membership. The following year it becomes a NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner, cooperating on missions and exercises.Russia builds up a massive military presence along Ukraine’s border. Russian president Vladimir Putin orders troops into separatist-held parts of Donetsk and Luhansk and recognizes the regions as independent. On February 24, 2022, Russia began a full assault on Ukraine by land, air, and sea.",
"Tonight, space fans around the world will party like it’s 1961.Since 2001, the evening of April 12 has been celebrated every year as Yuri’s Night—a global event to honor one of space exploration’s most beloved figures, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who was the first human to blast into space. Fans will dance, hoist drinks, attend lectures, and generally gather to pay tribute to a hero and revel in all things cosmic.A life-size cardboard model of Gagarin's training spacesuit—with a hole where the face would be—makes a perfect photo prop for fans.Though he never set foot outside his Vostok 1 spacecraft as it made a complete orbit around Earth, Gagarin’s journey was a major milestone in the space exploration timeline. He was the first person to see space from beyond the confines of the atmosphere, and the first person to witness the dazzling view of our planet from so far away.The head of a local school, Gagarin resident Natalia Tabac stands inside a museum created to honor Yuri Gagarin after his famous flight.Among Gagarin’s many admirers is Russian photographer Daria Garnik. Now in her 30s, Garnik became obsessed with space and science fiction as a teenager, when she was introduced to the American television series, The X-Files.Children sit in a classroom at a town school named after Yuri Gagarin.“Yuri Gagarin was a hero of mine when I was a kid,” she says, even though she was born years after Gagarin’s tragic death in a plane crash in 1968. “He was handsome, kind, down-to-earth and everyone could relate to him.”As an adult, Garnik wanted to learn more about the cosmonaut, so she began documenting the small provincial town west of Moscow where Gagarin grew up. Once called Gzhatsk, the town was officially renamed Gagarin to honor him when he died, and it has since become a shrine of sorts, with several historic homes, memorials, and museums that commemorate his achievements. (Learn why we need to change the way we talk about space exploration.)Archival photographs of Yuri Gagarin hang in the school where Gagarin studied for two years.“I came to Gagarin to shoot a story about memory, time, nostalgia for the first cosmonaut, and the cult that formed around him,” says Garnik, who grew up in the city of Ekaterinburg in Russia’s Ural Mountains. “I think I wanted to get to know Gagarin as a person who had a difficult life, and not just the media image from Soviet posters.”Now based in Minsk, Belarus, Garnik has traveled to the town of Gagarin twice so far for her photo project. Full of Soviet-era artifacts and posters celebrating the cosmonaut, the town has a timeless feel to it, she says.A mural featuring Yuri Gagarin brightens up the wall of a local school.“Gagarin hypnotized me with its atmosphere of being lost in time and preserved; I liked its slow pace of life,” she says.Though it caters to mere Earthlings, a local cafe looks a bit like the interior of a space capsule.Through this project, Garnik got to know many of Gagarin’s residents, some of whom remember him from when he was alive. After his pioneering spaceflight, Gagarin came back to his home town to visit his family; some of his relatives even still live there.Lyudmila Demina, who is the head of the Museum of the First Flight, sits in the museum's main exhibit area.For Garnik, April 12 is an important day: “I think Yuri would want that on this day, we also remembered Korolyov, Yazdovsky, Titov, and other wonderful scientists and enthusiasts who made his flight possible,” she says, referring to Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolyov, space medicine researcher Vladimir Yazdovsky, and cosmonaut Gherman Titov, who was the second person in space. (Read about the modern-day cosmonaut who has spent more time in orbit than any person, ever.)A sculpture of Yuri Gagarin sits on display at a local school.“He would want to popularize astronomy, space, and aviation so we could celebrate new scientific breakthroughs of mankind. He’d want us to look up more often, to dream, and to see further every time.”Space-themed graffiti decorates a concrete fence on Gagarin Street in the Russian town of Gagarin.",
"An illustration shows what a sustainable human presence might look like on Mars.When discussing space exploration, people often invoke stories about the exploration of our own planet, like the European conquest and colonization of the Americas, or the march westward in the 1800s, when newly minted Americans believed it was their duty and destiny to expand across the continent.But increasingly, government agencies, journalists, and the space community at large are recognizing that these narratives are born from racist, sexist ideologies that historically led to the subjugation and erasure of women and indigenous cultures, creating barriers that are still pervasive today.To ensure that humanity’s future off-world is less harmful and open to all, many of the people involved are revising the problematic ways in which space exploration is framed. Numerous conversations are taking place about the importance of using inclusive language, with scholars focusing on decolonizing humanity’s next journeys into space, as well as science in general.“Language matters, and it’s so important to be inclusive,” NASA astronaut Leland Melvin said recently during a talk at the University of Virginia.Lucianne Walkowicz, an astronomer featured in National Geographic’s docudrama series Mars, spent the last year studying the ethics of Mars exploration as the Chair of Astrobiology at the U.S. Library of Congress. We recently spoke with Walkowicz to examine the problems associated with old-fashioned verbiage and to discuss some solutions. What follows is a record of that conversation, edited for length and clarity.The language we use automatically frames how we envision the things we talk about. So, with space exploration, we have to consider how we are using that language, and what it carries from the history of exploration on Earth. Even if words like “colonization” have a different context off-world, on somewhere like Mars, it’s still not OK to use those narratives, because it erases the history of colonization here on our own planet. There’s this dual effect where it both frames our future and, in some sense, edits the past.One narrative that comes up a lot draws on the history of Europeans coming to the Americas. I’ve seen people talk about the arrival of the first European settlers as this romantic, heroic story of people making it in a harsh environment. But of course, there were already people here, in the Americas, when those historical events happened.Furthermore, a lot of the Europeans’ ability to live throughout the Americas came at the cost of genocide for indigenous people. I think it’s not intuitive, particularly when we talk to white Americans, for example, to think of the history of Columbus’s journey as a story of genocide. But it’s important to realize that’s what it is.A lot of those historical narratives are also bound up in the history of slavery, for example, so when we talk about how colonies in Virginia grew from being a few settlers to becoming tens of thousands of people, it’s also important to realize that roughly half of those people came against their own will, and many died along the way.Who is “our”?That is really a question for a historian. I’m not a historian, but I’ll tell you that there probably isn’t a perfectly starched, unblemished narrative that you can draw from. It’s just that we need to not be carelessly using narratives that are still the source of harm to a lot of people.I think the other one is “settlement.” That comes up a lot and obviously has a lot of connotations for folks about conflict in the Middle East. I think that’s one that people often turn to when they mean “inhabitation” or “humans living off-world.”Instead, I prefer using a couple of extra words, like “humans living on Mars,” or something that is maybe longer but more specific to what I mean. In the 1970s, Carl Sagan really liked the idea of space cities, because cities have lots of different kinds of people in them, generally speaking. But is a ship full of five people living on Mars actually a space city? Probably not. So, that isn’t necessarily the best solution, either.Yes, I do find “frontier” to be problematic. The implication is not exactly the same for somewhere like space as it is for here, but it similarly draws on the same kinds of narratives that are all based around European settlement. And often, if the word “frontier” comes up, it’s not wrong—until someone spells out the narrative of those brave explorers who went West in the early Americas.“Manned?” I don’t understand why anyone is still using “manned.” How old is the NASA style guide that says not to use “manned?” It’s been around literally for years [since 2006, to be precise].It’s so lazy. Just think about it a little bit.I think that one of the very first steps forward is to stop having our narratives about space only coming from people who are extremely privileged, which in this space means predominantly rich, white, male venture capitalists. That’s really who’s driving a lot of the narratives that are used, and why there’s not a lot of forethought or response to critiques about those frontier, colonialist narratives.A self-portrait of the Mars rover Curiosity.If there’s going to be a really inclusive effort to go beyond Earth, it has to start here on Earth. It can’t just be a tokenization of what the first crew might look like. It really has to be that people from a wider range of experiences and backgrounds—whether that means socioeconomic, racial, gender, whatever—are included in STEM in general. None of those narratives will become more inclusive until the people shaping them can become more inclusive. Otherwise, it’s just lip service.There are much more direct examples, too. Most notably, Jeff Bezos saying that he has so much money now that he can’t think of anything to spend it on that isn’t space tourism. He lives in Seattle, a city where Amazon itself has changed people’s access to affordable housing. The city has been gentrified out of control, with large new developments that house lots of Amazon employees now sitting on community centers that I cooked food for the homeless in. Or, Elon Musk wearing an Occupy Mars shirt, which is totally and completely ridiculous when compared to what the Occupy movement is. There’s another thing you can’t take out of context.The governing document that sets forth all of space law, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, literally says that space is for everyone. I mean, it’s 1967, so it says “for all mankind,” but if we edit that to be in the sense of the document, the outer space treaty says that space is for humankind, and that it is not to be owned by any individual or nation. It bars things like weapons of mass destruction, and it says outright that you cannot have a military installation on a celestial body.When you look at the Outer Space Treaty, it’s this really aspirational document that contains a lot of really good things about the ways that we can and cannot explore space. However, if you read indigenous scholarship, or you listen to indigenous people, you’ll know that treaties get broken all the time. Literally every single treaty, over 500 of them that have been made with indigenous nations by the United States, have been broken.I think that this is the moment, as it becomes more possible for a wider range of actors—whether they be nations or individual or otherwise—to go to space, when we have to decide whether those guiding principles are what we really want. This is the moment when we have to look at that treaty and decide who we want to be in the future.",
"NASA research mathematician Katherine Johnson sits at her desk at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.As a girl growing up in rural West Virginia, Katherine Johnson loved to count. She counted everything: the steps between her house and the road, the number of dishes she’d washed—anything that could be quantified.Johnson started high school by the time she was 10. By 18, she’d finished college, where she excelled as a math major and was sometimes the only student in the hardest courses offered.She was, by all accounts, brilliant.That brilliance, which is chronicled in a recent book and the upcoming movie Hidden Figures, would eventually help the United States win the space race, a geopolitical competition that peaked with the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969.But in the first half of the 20th century, Johnson was penned in by stereotypes about her race and her gender, as well as Jim Crow laws that mandated the segregation of African-Americans.With limited options, Johnson initially took a job teaching math, French, and music at Virginia public schools, since that was, she said, the obvious thing to do with her talents.“You could be a nurse or a teacher,” she said in a video interview with MAKERS.Then, in 1953, a small group of "human computers” at Langley Research Center in Virginia came calling. Mechanical computers were just beginning to emerge in research labs, so to perform complex calculations, most teams primarily relied on skilled people who were nimble-minded and facile with numbers. In aeronautics labs around the country, these jobs were often filled by women.Dorothy Vaughan (far left) worked in Langley's segregated West Area computing unit and was promoted to lead the group, making her the first African-American supervisor at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the precursor to NASA.Johnson applied for a job as a computer at Langley and went to work under the direction of Dorothy Vaughan, the first African-American woman to supervise the center’s cadre of human calculators. Also among them was Mary Jackson, who would go on to become the first female African-American engineer employed by NASA.After just two weeks, Johnson was transferred to the Flight Research Division, where she and her colleagues were eventually tasked with helping NASA meet the challenge posed by the Soviets with the 1957 launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite, followed by the 1961 orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space. (Also see “25 Years on, Collapse of Soviet Union Still Brings Cheers—And Tears.”)In 1961, Johnson calculated and plotted the trajectory Alan Shepard’s space capsule would follow as it briefly left Earth. The next year, Johnson calculated and plotted the path astronaut John Glenn would take when he showed a restless, anxious country that it, too, could send a person into orbit and meet the Soviet challenge.After circling the Earth three times, Glenn safely splashed down—but he reportedly was not willing to even begin his journey until Johnson had verified the calculations produced by a new breed of robotic computer (her computations matched the machine’s, and the rest is history).Mary Jackson spent 34 years on the job at NASA as a mathematician and aeronautical engineer.In 1969, Johnson helped send Apollo 11 to the moon, which is the mission she’s most proud of.“I computed the path that would get you there,” she told MAKERS. “We told them how fast they would be going, and the moon would be there when you got there.”Johnson retired from NASA in 1986, and over decades of service she played a role in every space program the agency launched, including the space shuttle program. In 2015, President Obama awarded 97-year-old Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.“It was my job,” she says simply. “And I did my job correctly—and well.”But the truth is, it wasn’t so easy.Melba Roy headed the group of mathematicians who worked on a pioneering communications satellite experiment for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in the 1960s.When Johnson started calculating celestial trajectories, the civil rights movement was still gaining momentum, and the group of female computers Vaughan led was sequestered in a room with a sign outside that read “Colored Computers.”Still, Langley not only recognized the expertise of these women and offered them jobs based solely on their abilities but trusted them with the astronauts' lives.“Langley was an unusual place,” says Bill Barry, NASA’s chief historian. It was progressive, he says, and populated with scientists and engineers from all over the country who cared more about hard data than societal constructs.“To some degree, they could ‘get away with’ flouting social conventions of Tidewater Virginia because of this,” Barry says. “The conditions were ripe for this stereotype-shattering anomaly to happen.”Even now, Johnson, Vaughan, and Jackson stand out as role models for women like Christine Darden, who climbed atop their shoulders to become one of NASA’s preeminent engineers and a leading expert in supersonic flight.Christine Darden works in the control room of a Langley wind tunnel in 1975.Today, women—and especially minority women—continue to battle prejudice in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering and struggle to prove that their brains are every bit as good as a man’s. It’s a frustrating reality, but one that can be changed.“We hope that this story will inspire many young people to pursue education and their dreams,” Barry says. “After all, if there is one thing clear from our history, it is that you never know what kind of package your most brilliant employees might come in.”[Editor's Note: This story has been updated to correct the year of the Apollo 11 moon landing.]",
"An illustration shows the landing site of the Huygens probe on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. On January 14, 2005, Huygens completed the farthest landing on another world ever attempted.Dear Huygens,I owe you and your people an apology. Although I was working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on data from your companion orbiter Cassini at the time, I don’t remember where I was when I saw your first images of Titan.Truth be told, I paid very little attention to your landing. I remember the day—January 14, 2005—quite vividly, but not because of your accomplishments. At the time, I was dealing with a health problem that would result in surgery a few weeks later, and while trapped in typical Los Angeles traffic leaving the doctor, I found out I’d basically failed the physics GRE, dampening my hopes of going to graduate school and becoming a scientist. I cried a lot that day. None of my tears were from space-exploration joy.Thankfully, my leg turned out fine, giant three-inch scar and all, and I got into the graduate programs I really wanted to attend. Ever since, your beautiful data and I have spent a lot of time together.Your descent through Titan’s atmosphere marked just the beginning of what would turn out to be one of the most spectacular journeys of exploration in the history of humankind. Your best friend and longtime companion, the Cassini spacecraft, went on to discover that the Saturn system was more interesting than our wildest dreams. But while your time exploring Titan was brief—219 minutes—you did something Cassini could never do. You touched the surface of a new world for the first time. You told us things about Titan that we could only know by going there.On October 15, 1997, a Titan IVB/Centaur carried the Cassini orbiter and its attached Huygens probe to Saturn. More than seven years later, Huygens made the most distant landing ever attempted, touching down on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan.Thanks to you and Cassini, we have peered through the hazy blanket that covers Titan, revealing a bizarre landscape with water-ice mountains and rivers that run with liquid hydrocarbons. Methane falls as rain there.To understand how this alien world works, it’s essential to understand how sunlight filters through Titan’s thick atmosphere. How does sunlight determine the temperature at different altitudes above Titan’s surface? What kinds of sunlight are available to provide energy for chemistry—or perhaps even to fuel Titanian life, if it exists?My first months in graduate school were spent trying to understand the data taken by your Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer, which was built to answer these very questions. As you descended through Titan’s atmosphere, it looked up, down, and at the sun to figure out exactly what sunlight was doing there. As with many first projects in graduate school, my time spent working on the resulting data did not really amount to much. But I did develop a profound respect for the people who built you.It wasn’t until 2016, about a decade later, that I returned to your data for a project I had been wanting to do for years: a reanalysis of measurements made by your Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer, the closest thing you had to a nose. As you descended toward the surface, you ingested tiny bits of Titan’s atmosphere along the way and sent them into this instrument for analysis. These data are incredibly precious, as we cannot measure an atmosphere’s precise makeup using just a telescope.Titan, as seen from six miles above the surface. This view was created by stitching together images from the Huygens probe.As someone who studies the atmosphere, I still use your data every single day. The near-surface temperature and composition measurements you made are extremely difficult or impossible to do remotely, so we’ll continue to rely on them until we have another mission. Your composition measurements are helping us figure out why Titan even has an atmosphere in the first place. Thanks to your camera, we know that Titan’s haze particles are fractal aggregates, which we’ve now included in almost every atmospheric model for this remarkable moon.And of course, you captured amazing images of the channels cutting across the surface—and the first rounded pebbles we had seen anywhere else in the solar system besides Earth.In your data, there is so much information about Titan’s past, present, and future. Using tools that weren’t available when you landed, we might one day be able to figure out even more secrets hiding in your collections. (Titan may, for instance, host the right chemistry for vinyl-based life.)I keep wanting to tell you everything we’ve learned since we last heard from you, but then I remember that you already know, because you are there. I expect you know so many things that you wish you could tell us, answers to questions we had not even thought to ask when we built you. Many of your people are gone now. We miss them, too.I often think of you sitting there on the surface, your mission goals accomplished and your job long finished. I wonder if it has rained on you. Are your camera lenses covered in haze? If so, how much? How strongly does the wind blow, and how often? I occasionally let myself wonder if you’ve had visitors. Sometimes I feel bad that you are so cold, and stuck, and alone. I imagine you wish you had wheels or wings or rotors so that you could see what is over the horizon.Agency: European Space AgencyLaunch Date: October 15, 1997Launch Vehicle: Titan IVB/CentaurTitan Landing: January 14, 2005Mass: 701 pounds (318 kilograms)Power Source: 5 lithium sulfur dioxide batteriesI understand the frustration of desperately wanting to venture somewhere that seems just outside your reach. You and I were both made to study Titan, I think: kindred spirits separated by a billion miles.I’m sorry that while you were hard at work in Titan’s atmosphere, I was so preoccupied with daily life that I missed a moment that is really important to me now. All of those things could have waited, but you only landed on Titan once. I’m trying to make it up to you and your people by caring for your data and figuring out what you were trying to tell us. I’m saying thank you by helping train the next generation of planetary scientists and engineers and working to send you a new space robot friend. Some people might think that is a weird way to apologize and say thank you, but this is the best way I know.If they would let me, I would send you a blanket and an umbrella, maybe some hot chocolate and some good books to read. I hope you’ll settle for another space robot, someday.Love always,Sarah",
"Saturn's icy moon Enceladus sinks behind the planet in a farewell portrait from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which destroyed itself by diving into the ringed giant on September 15, 2017.Dear Cassini,The day you left us, nearly a year ago now, was bittersweet. I knew there was an end date—that 13 years at Saturn was already a lot to ask of you—but when the day arrived for you to go, I wasn’t ready.That morning, hundreds of us sat together at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California waiting for your signal to vanish. Your NASA team members were scattered around the room, some smiling because they were so proud, while others were in tears. My heart was pounding knowing you were falling backward, trying so hard to face your home until the end. I pictured your instruments breaking off, igniting so fast they vaporized, the atmosphere agape, swallowing your arms, then the larger pieces. As you tore apart—shattering and melting—you kept talking, calling, whispering until the end.Now, you are a haze, your body turned to watercolor. But you are part of the narrative of a planet whose story began billions of years ago. The metal that made you was born of stars, like the bones in my body and the blood in my veins. And, as will one day happen to the people who loved you, your elements have been returned to the cosmos.Twenty years before, you said goodbye to us for the first time, setting our clouds alight when you launched from Earth. I watched a video of your departure not too long ago—the announcer at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida excitedly raised his voice: “Four, three, two, one … and liftoff of the Cassini spacecraft on a billion-mile trek to Saturn.” Everyone’s heads craned back as they watched the long tail of flames pushing you up and away.But I was just a teenager at the time, and like most kids, I was pre-occupied with daily life and less interested in anything outside of myself. I was too young to really understand why you were on your mission. In all honesty, I didn’t know you existed. I loved the stars and space, but the dependable darkness that I casually admired from my window or saw via a random upward glance didn’t connect me to you.I had first gazed at Saturn through my grandfather’s telescope when I was a child. When I moved my eye away, there was just one point of light, and when I looked into the lens, a whole planet appeared. The hazy, vibrating image was so foreign to me; I didn’t know what to make of it, but I remembered wondering what it would be like to go there in a spaceship.As the years passed, you arrived at Saturn, and I found myself suddenly more aware of the ringed world. Through your eyes, I saw something new, and I was entranced. Almost without trying, I knew those rings, the tan atmosphere, the eclectic family of moons.­­­And yet, I did not know you. By the time your full meaning sunk in for me, you didn’t have much time left.When I think about you now and all that you’ve accomplished in your lifetime, I am amazed. Not only did you teach us about the most iconic planet in our solar system, but you also brought the world together. During your 13 years, anyone could sit atop your radio dish and hold on every time you changed course around the giant moon Titan, skimmed above Saturn’s rings, or daringly swung out to the ice moon Enceladus to sniff and taste its alien water geysers. We were all there, as planetary scientist Linda Spilker says, with “ring-side seats.” Your arcs through space were risky—one wrong move could have cut us off forever. But as you dove through your complex ballet, your risks yielded immeasurable rewards.The discovery of those geysers on Enceladus and the bizarre methane lakes on Titan have already changed our understanding of where life might exist in the solar system. Because of you, I’ll likely see missions set out to those moons on the quest to find out whether we have company in our own cosmic neighborhood. That is part of your legacy.When I come across images you took or recall the discoveries you made, I still feel a deep, profound admiration—but a sigh follows each exultation. Every day that you aren’t calling in, sending new discoveries or photos, is a reminder of how trapped we are without you.The day before we were due to lose you, you called into the Deep Space Network one last time to deliver your final set of images, and for a second, we lost our connection to you. The urgency on everyone’s faces was so telling—connection is everything. I’ve seen some element of this every time I have been in NASA’s mission control. Each call from you briefly lifted us out of ourselves and placed us among the stars.After your grand finale last September, we toasted your triumphs and held vigil. During that celebration of your life, I found out how many more people were also heartbroken over losing you, and how much you touched the lives of people who did not even know you existed.Agencies: NASA, ESALaunch Date: October 15, 1997Launch Vehicle: Titan IVB/CentaurStart of Mission: June 30, 2004End of Mission: September 15, 2017Mass: 12,593 pounds (with Huygens probe)Power Source: Radioisotope Thermoelectric GeneratorOn my way to JPL to witness the end, a man at the airport made a comment about the Saturn sticker I had on my laptop. It’s a purple-ish backlit image, the one the team loves the most. He said, “I love that photo of Saturn. Do you know how they took it?” I told him that you did, but that your mission was ending in two days. He was shocked, and said, “I didn’t know there was a spacecraft at Saturn.” The same moment he became thrilled to know you, he too instantly started to grieve. And I realized that we were not mourning so much for your body, but for our own sense of what we have lost.When we sent you away, we asked you to give us a view otherwise unreachable, to shrink the billion miles of space between us into something smaller and more precious. You were our ambassador and explorer, carrying the eyes and ears of more than six billion people. You were always more than metal; you were the dream of the thousands of scientists who built you, the sum of their late nights, missed dinners, their long-unanswered childhood questions about the cosmos. Together we rebelled against the limits of our fragile bodies and the gravity of our planet. On your journey to Saturn, you made us all astronauts.I know I’m too late, but I wish I could say thank you for the 13 years, even for the thousands of days I didn’t know you were out there exploring for me. What a gift it is to be given a new perspective and to see where we are in this universe. What a tremendous gift you gave us all: a view of our place in the cosmos—a view that is worth knowing and loving and protecting.You may not recall, but your project manager Earl Maize said just before your finale that you “going out in a blaze of glory is a spectacular ending and a phenomenal conclusion to a chapter in humankind’s exploration of the planets. The book is not complete. There is more to come.”Indeed, I am buoyed by the fact that we can build future Cassini’s and send them out into the dark, setting ourselves free once again. Surely someday we will even go back to Saturn. And when we arrive, we will all sit atop the antenna of your successor, gazing into the face of the majestic world that embraced you, and we will meet again.Thank you for giving me the stars.Thank you for taking me to Saturn.Love,Shannon",
"Sputnik 1, the first human-made satellite placed in orbit around Earth.Dear Sputnik,You are the main reason I wished so often to be born a couple of decades earlier than I actually was. Just imagine the sorrow of a space fan who barely missed the epochal event in 1957 that humanity had dreamed of for centuries: the launch of Earth’s first artificial satellite, and the dawn of a new Space Age.In the late 1970s, I was coming of age in Moscow in the Soviet Union. As I looked up at the skies through the telescope of the Moscow planetarium, I remember arriving at two vague ideas about space exploration: that you had started without me, and that you were already a fossil, a legend of a bygone era.Images of you were almost as common as portraits of Vladimir Lenin and slogans about the victories of socialism. You were everywhere: on postage stamps, greeting cards, matchboxes, and monuments. Your name adorned hotels and cinemas, restaurants and discos, radios and razors, candies and cakes.The author inside the vehicle assembly building in Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, in the summer of 2000. The Soyuz rocket seen here is a direct descendant of the ballistic missile that launched Sputnik in 1957.But like other decaying Soviet symbols, you had detached from reality, becoming a cliché to my parents’ increasingly cynical generation. Each day, they passed your likeness on propaganda posters as they pushed themselves into overcrowded streetcars and buses in the morning to get to work. At the end of their long days at factories and offices, tired and exhausted, they had to endure humiliating lines in half-empty stores for basic necessities, from bologna and cheese to socks and shorts—and, near the USSR’s end, even toilet paper.My generation was also turning away from you and other Soviet space heroes, succumbing to the “corrupting influence” of the West: jeans, ABBA, Pepsi, and the golosa, the “voices” such as Voice of America and the BBC that we heard on the radio. Our parents taught us how to tune in to them over the deafening noise of KGB suppression transmitters.But beneath the Levis and refrains of “Mamma Mia,” I was first and foremost a space geek, and I needed to know your origin story. I looked everywhere I could to learn more about you and the Soviet space program, but exploring your past quickly got difficult—if not dangerous.Anybody who tried to peek beyond the dull façade of your official biography discovered an iron curtain of secrecy and paranoia. One day, my father brought me a roll of film with photocopies of western articles about the Soviet and U.S. space programs, which I had asked him to find in a limited-access technical library. I was careless enough to take the film to a nearby photo shop for paper copies; when I returned to pick them up, the staff looked at me as if they had caught a CIA agent!Agency: OKB-1 (S.P.

We couldn’t read about it in any book, and we weren’t supposed to ask our teachers about it. But during one of my early childhood trips by commuter train, I caught a tantalizing glimpse.We were riding along the Yaroslavl Railroad on the way to our family’s dacha, or country house. Two train stops away from our destination, my father pointed at a monumental brick building towering over barbed wire fences near the station of Podlipki. “That’s where Korolev built his sputniks and rockets,” my father whispered. “But don’t tell anybody, because posadyat.” He looked up as he said the word, which literally translates as “to get you to sit down.” We both knew its real meaning: to get thrown in prison.Not surprisingly, for a kid, it sounded both scary and terribly exciting. Nothing fires up your interest more than a forbidden mystery. Looking back, this moment planted a seed of fascination within me. I needed to see inside.Whenever we stayed at the dacha, I sometimes returned to Podlipki with my parents to stock up on provisions in the main grocery store, which offered a wider selection than the neighboring towns’ dreary shops and increasingly empty shelves. In some funny way, I have to thank you, Sputnik, for making my parents’ lives a little easier. We all flocked to Podlipki because it was an open secret that the town was on the moskovskoye snabzhenie, earning a special “Moscow-level supply” because of its status as the spacecraft-building town.This iconic Hubble image of the spiral galaxy NGC 1300 is suffused with detail—bright blue young stars, the dust lanes spiraling around the bright nucleus, distant galaxies shining through.But at the time, my parents didn’t necessarily appreciate your contribution. Like many other families across the Soviet Union gathering for meals, they actually blamed you and your rockets for the scarcity of food on the table. For a while, their discontent was limited to those “kitchen talks.” But it was only a matter of time—an unbelievably short one, as we soon realized—before the USSR would collapse, taking its magnificent space program down with it.Fast-forward to the 1990s. Podlipki was renamed after Sergei Korolev, the legendary father of the Soviet space program who blessed your development and design. Still infected with the space geek virus, I was now a journalist—and I had finally received very special permission to visit your secret birthplace.I remember riding a taxi along the familiar fence and telling the driver to turn into a short driveway that ended with imposing metal gates. There were no signs, doorbells, or guards; the driver looked at me with considerable apprehension. But I assured him it was the right turn, even as my heart was pounding.A moment after we had approached, the gates opened and we drove into a small parking lot completely enclosed by another internal fence: Korolev’s famous lovushka (trap), a locale often mentioned in the memoirs of Soviet space veterans.I showed my passport there and was led into your cradle. There was Korolev’s long office, still in use by his successors, with giant curtained walls on two sides. The curtains on the left were open, revealing windows to the outside. The opposite windowless wall remained veiled, however, hiding secret designs that saw the light of day only during classified meetings.I can picture Korolev pulling back the curtain to unveil you for the first time: a tiny silver sphere that would change the world.In the years since, I have made a pilgrimage to almost every place connected to your biography. I’ve stood many times near the spot where you had blasted into orbit in the darkness of night on October 4, 1957, and I’ve visited probably every museum around the world that displays your replica.Why do all of this? I guess I’m compensating for the fact that I missed your birthday.Anatoly",
"Galileo Galilei discovered that the Earth orbits the sun, an observation for which he was put under house arrest for the last eight years of his life.Not every astronomer can claim to have enjoyed both the attention of the Inquisition and the Indigo Girls, but then again, Galileo was no ordinary genius.Discoverer of moons, toppler of Aristotle's physics, and celebrated loser of history's most famous heresy trial, Galileo Galilei's greatest invention, in truth, was our own modern world.On the 450th anniversary of his birth today, February 15, 2014, it's worth taking a telescopic look at the achievements of this unparalleled genius of the Renaissance. Born in 1564 in Pisa, Italy, Galileo lived to the age of 77, a life span that saw the start of the scientific revolution in Europe. (See also: "Galileo's Telescope at 400.")Galileo is still in the news. An optical illusion he discovered in the 1600s caused Venus to appear much larger and blurrier—a "radiant crown," as Galileo called it—when seen through a telescope than when viewed with the naked eye.The puzzle was finally understood just this week. Neuroscientists from the State University of New York College of Optometry report that the answer lies in the wiring of our visual brain cells. The brain responds to light and dark objects differently, so the brightness of a planet distorts its apparent size when it is seen against the dark background of space.Heaven and Hell"Infinite thanks to God," Galileo wrote in 1610, "for being so kind as to make me alone the first observer of marvels kept hidden."He was celebrating his discovery of Jupiter's four large moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Originally he wanted to name the moons after his noble patrons, four brothers of Florence's famed Medici family called Cosimo, Francesco, Carl, and Lorenzo. Other astronomers, perhaps thankfully, assigned more elevated names to the moons, ones taken from mythology for the consorts of Jupiter, king of the gods.Those moons revealed that some objects revolved around something other than the Earth, which helped Galileo to discover heliocentrism, or the fact that the Earth circles the sun. This finding, in turn, would earn him the attention of the Inquisition, which investigated religious rebellion and heresy in the world of 16th-century Italy. The Vatican officially apologized in 2000 for Galileo's heresy trial, which resulted in the scientist being kept under house arrest for the last eight years of his life.Using telescopes he built, Galileo was the first to identify the four large moons of Jupiter.Cannonball PhysicsGalileo's most famous experiment, which he likely never really performed, was the 1589 dropping of cannonballs with different masses off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The goal of this experiment was to show that objects fall at a uniform rate, that gravity doesn't make heavier objects fall faster.That notion was contrary to classic Greek physics, which held that heavier objects fall faster. In 1971 the experiment was repeated on the moon (to remove the effects of air resistance) by Apollo 15 astronauts, who dropped a hammer and a feather to confirm Galileo's observation.What was notable about the experiment was precisely that it was an experiment. Earlier models of scientific inquiry were reasoned entirely in the mind or argued from theological principles. Galileo, by contrast, advanced the fundamental idea that science relied on experiments to prove its contentions. This simple idea—prove it—was radical at the time.Galileo went even further, pioneering the idea that mathematics are essential to scientific observations, and abjuring the literary hand-waving of ancient texts. He was the father of mathematical physics, reporting his observations in tables that inspired today's lab books. The diagrams he made depicting astronomical objects are clear forerunners to modern ones.He put his knowledge to practical use, grinding the lenses for improved telescopes that allowed him to make astronomical discoveries ahead of other scholars—spotting moons, finding sunspots, and peering into the craters of Earth's moon.As recounted in his volume Starry Messenger, Galileo crafted a telescope for the sailing masters of Venice that magnified views by at least eight times, helping them look out for pirates on trading voyages.According to legend, Galileo dropped a cannonball and a wooden ball from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to see which fell faster.Open Access ScienceIn his writings and books, some published in Holland to avoid the wrath of the Inquisition, Galileo gave shape to an ideal that exists in the scientific community to this very day: that scientists are united in their quest to understand the unknown and that their voyage of discovery transcends national borders. Galileo widely corresponded with other natural philosophers and the great innovative minds of his time, such as Johannes Kepler, who first wrote down the laws of orbital motion.In writing down their discoveries, Galileo and his contemporaries created the beginnings of the system of scientific correspondence that we know today as scientific journals, where discoveries are openly described by their methods, results, and possible shortfalls.This was quite a contrast to the gnomic writings of alchemists, who cloaked their recipes in mythological allusions and double-talk. The open discourse of the scientific enterprise is one of the abiding gifts of the Renaissance. (Although it is worth noting that Galileo resorted to scrambling news of his findings in code in letters to Kepler.)Galileo not only wrote to fellow scholars, he also wrote for the public, notes historian Doug Linder in his account of the trial of Galileo. "He seemed compelled to act as a consultant in natural philosophy to all who would listen," Linder writes. "He wrote in tracts, pamphlets, letters, and dialogues—not in the turgid, polysyllabic manner of a university pedant, but simply and directly."That talent for communication was quite likely what got him in hot water with religious authorities, ending with the heresy trial, one of history's crueler attacks on independent thinking. The trial haunted the Vatican for centuries; its treatment of Galileo added momentum to the Enlightenment's demand for intellectual freedom, which opened the way for such documents as the U.S. Constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The scientist's communication skills were said to be overbearing at times. "Everyone agrees that Galileo was an incorrigible egotist, so full of himself that he repeatedly misjudged his ability to persuade the authorities of his own opinions," astronomical historian Owen Gingerich of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics noted in a recent review of Galileo biographies.Whatever his flaws, "Galileo was the most articulate spokesman for the new astronomy, the pioneer who set observational astronomy on its modern track," Gingerich said.And beyond his scientific achievements, Galileo is remembered in the popular imagination as a courageous truthseeker, a view expressed in the song "Galileo" by the folk rock group Indigo Girls. He was, they sing, "king of night vision, king of insight."Remembered, too, 450 years after his birth, is Galileo's (likely apocryphal) rejoinder to the Inquisitors, "Yet still, it moves." He was talking about the Earth, which today everyone knows as one of many planets, a place happily shaped more by Galileo than by any of his persecutors.Follow Dan Vergano on Twitter.",
"For many city people, a clear night sky is a mythical beast. We’ve heard the legends inspired by the constellations and we know sailors used the stars to guide their way home, but urban light pollution means we can’t quite see the heavens ourselves.Enter the International Dark-Sky Association. The U.S. nonprofit, founded in 1988, recognizes parks, reserves, and places across the world that offer the best views of the galaxy we call home. Most are open to campers or offer visitor lodging—meaning you can spend the whole night looking up at the sky’s universal beauty.Seeing constellations so clearly grows more difficult each year, National Geographic reports. Electric lights have revolutionized our lives, but as illumination increases, the toll on wildlife and human health is becoming harder to ignore. This makes dark sky destinations all the more important—both to see and to protect.The world’s first International Dark-Sky Park, Natural Bridges lies beneath skies almost perfectly free from light pollution—labeled Class 2 on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, meaning the Milky Way and certain other celestial objects are visible to the naked eye.At the Utah monument, visitors can drive and hike through stream-carved canyons—home to coyotes, mountain lions, and desert flora—and take in views of centuries-old Native-American ruins before camping overnight.This UNESCO-established biosphere reserve is known as the “land of endless horizons.” Its starry skies have IDA’s Silver Tier-status, with crystalline views of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.For the darkest nights, head to the center of the reserve, where the nearly 200,000 residents use sustainable outdoor lighting at night. A nonprofit at the Rhön Star Park offers guided stargazing and night walks.A lone photographer stands in Moab, Utah, silhouetted against a night sky that reveals the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, and the moon.Mackenzie Basin, in Aoraki Mackenzie Reserve, has the best skies for stargazing in New Zealand. Home to the country’s largest mountain, the glacier-studded park is great for camping and mountaineering. Take a nightly stargazing tour at Mount John University Observatory or at Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre and Planetarium to view the Milky Way, the Southern Cross, Alpha Centauri, and Sirius. The reserve protects its dark-sky heritage in respect to the indigenous Maori people, for whom the stars play a role in navigation and folklore.Stars sprawl above the Church of the Good Shepherd in New Zealand’s Aoraki Mackenzie Reserve.Named after its black cherry trees, this Pennsylvania park is best known for its two annual star parties, which draw local families—and astronomers from around the world. Plan ahead to attend during the Perseids meteor shower every August.Cherry Springs offers a network of forest trails for hiking and snowmobiling, facilities for camping and picnics, and regular stargazing programs. Between 60 to 85 nights of the year are said to have ideal conditions for observing celestial objects.It was from Pic du Midi that NASA’s scientists studied the moonscape in preparation for the Apollo landing. The mountain reserve is home to a UNESCO World Heritage site—the Pyrénées-Mont Perdu landscape—and a national park. Take the cable car to the dramatic mountaintop observatory, perched above the clouds. Visitors can also spend the night in a package deal that includes overnight stay and meals, a tour of the telescopes and stargazing with astronomers, and skiing.A prime tourist draw and popular Hollywood filming location, the red-rock landscape of the desert town of Sedona, Arizona, earns IDA’s Dark Sky Community label for its minimal light pollution. Night views through a telescope include the Whirlpool Galaxy, or Messier 51a, located about 35 million light years away.The Parc National du Mont Mégantic—the world’s first dark-sky reserve—offers public access to the ASTROlab observatory and astronomy nights for especially starry-eyed visitors. Visitors can also camp in the park, climb Mont St. Joseph and Mont Mégantic, follow hiking trails through the coniferous and mixed forests, and go skiing and snowshoeing.The Zselic Starry Sky Park has near-unaltered dark skies, offering naked-eye views of the elusive Triangulum Galaxy on clear nights. The park has an astronomy program for visitors that includes full-dome movies at the planetarium, a meteorite collection, telescopic observation at day and night, and nightly guided tours.",
"A lone photographer stands in Moab, Utah, silhouetted against a night sky that reveals the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, and the moon.A gorgeous photograph of the night sky can enchant even the weariest of souls. It can reveal galaxies, meteors, and otherworldly light. But to get such an image requires extreme calibration. The weather needs to be just right, as does the camera setting. A tripod is a must. Patience and practice are key.Then, if the stars align, what could have been a ho-hum picture of the darkness suddenly becomes a brilliant portrait of the cosmos.Such was the goal for the photographers who submitted their images to this year’s Astronomy Photographer of the Year contest. Now in its 10th year, the contest is run by the Royal Observatory Greenwich, in association with Insight Investment and BBC Sky at Night magazine.“With a competition that keeps on flourishing over the years, the growing community of amateur astrophotographers have time after time surprised us with technically accomplished, playfully imaginative and astoundingly beautiful images that sit at the intersection of art and science” competition judge Melanie Vandenbrouck, curator of art at Royal Museums Greenwich, says in a press release.“This year did not disappoint,” she adds. “To pick just 31 winners from the 134 shortlisted images was fiendishly difficult!”Above are some of our favorites from this year's competition winners.",
"Shoot for the StarsPut our world squarely in the middle of the universe that we can see with our naked eyes (it’s out there every night). Include the landscape—and look for opportunities to capture something unique. Arizona Sky Village in Portal, Arizona, is a dark-sky housing development. Every house has a telescope built in, and one of the streets really is named Milky Way, which I wanted to show. A little pop of flash did the trick.Something wonderful has happened in photography: Ordinary people can now photograph the universe.Standing beneath the Milky Way has always been a beautiful sight, if you were lucky enough to find dark skies on a dark night. But the revelation of recent advances in digital photography is that the dim ribbon of silvery light we see with our naked eyes is actually a glorious, stupendous galaxy.For me the revelation came the first time I took a photograph of that galaxy and realized that just because the visible universe is so far away didn’t mean I needed a big telescope to photograph it. No, what I needed was a wide-angle lens because it is so huge—and we live in the middle of it.When I show young people my first published picture of the Milky Way I like to point out that this is their home. Earth lies about a third of the way out on one of those vast spiral arms of stars and dust clouds. Being able to take a snapshot of that universe is something new under the sun. And it’s great fun too.Jim Richardson has been a National Geographic photographer for over three decades, documenting landscapes and cultures around the world.

"For generations, kids who wanted to fundraise for a worthy cause could gather supplies from the kitchen, mix a pitcher of lemonade, and set up a stand on their street corner.But when life gives you coronavirus, you have to make do with a different approach to helping others. One that, for the most part, involves staying inside your house.All forms of volunteering have changed radically over the past few months, says Greg Baldwin, CEO of VolunteerMatch, the largest web platform connecting people to service opportunities with nonprofits. “Stay-at-home orders had a devastating impact on volunteer programs. So many are postponed,” he says.Although the need for help has never been greater, no one wants to compromise anyone’s health and safety, so finding opportunities—especially for kids—may require more patience and persistence than in the past. “Organizers have begun to reboot, trying to find a way forward,” says Baldwin, noting that new opportunities are being added to his site every day. (Be sure to click on the “kids” filter to get a more targeted list.)It still can be tricky territory to navigate, especially for families with young children who are already limited in what kinds of activities are feasible. Don’t let that deter you, urges Baldwin, who fondly remembers his earliest volunteer endeavors, including the time he helped his dad’s Rotary Club set up an Easterseals summer camp. “My task was to paint the silver rocket on the Putt-Putt golf course,” Baldwin says. These experiences taught him how rewarding volunteering can be and broadened his worldview.Volunteering may be even more beneficial for children right now, says Amanda Zelechoski, associate professor of psychology at Valparaiso University and director of the Psychology, Law, and Trauma Lab, which is conducting the Coronavirus Family Impact Project. “Something happened out of our control. It’s pretty traumatic,” she says. “What are ways we can bring control back into our lives? How can we feel empowered?” One answer: Work on a service project together as a family.The key is encouraging kids to “feel like they can do something,” says Maryam Abdullah, a developmental psychologist and the parenting program director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. “They feel competent. They’re contributing. And that feels good,” she says.Children of all ages can volunteer—Abdullah notes that even babies exhibit signs of wanting to help others. In lab studies, kids who are just over a year old have picked up objects they thought a researcher needed.To foster these tendencies, model volunteering behavior to show children that it’s something you value. For example, when Zelechoski’s husband delivers meals to people in need in their community, their three boys always ride along in the car. “They’ve never known anything different,” she says, adding that the trips also serve as a reminder to focus on what they’re grateful for.Parents might worry about introducing topics like hunger, illness, or homelessness to children. But explaining these ideas in the context of how they can help may make the conversations easier. “Kids want to make sense of the world around them,” Zelechoski says. Just be prepared to answer the questions that will inevitably arise.Then let them take part in the planning and decision-making about what kind of volunteer service you want to do. What if they have impractical suggestions? “Celebrate the idea, and then guide to the heart of it. What is their purpose? Help them troubleshoot,” Abdullah says.Here are a few categories to consider:In this time of unprecedented stress, Zelechoski wants to remind parents that not every form of service has to be “capital V volunteering.” Drawing cheerful images with chalk in your driveway or posting signs in your windows can lift others up. You can take those ideas a step further by turning your free sidewalk library (decorating a shoebox or another container works too) into a sidewalk chalk-holder that anyone can use to draw their own uplifting messages. Or give your kids a daily challenge by asking them to come up with a different happy animal to illustrate for display.Keep the feel-good vibes going by asking your kids to pack up toys and clothes to donate, or to decide on a charity that could really use the contents of their piggy banks. Abdullah suggests checking out the website for Youth Service America, which offers downloadable activity guides for a variety of easy at-home projects, like assembling snack sacks for your local food pantry.Figure out what kinds of causes your kids are passionate about, and then contact local organizations working on those issues. They’ll likely have some ideas of how your kids can help, possibly by raising awareness among their friends or drumming up donations.Anyone who can sew—kids included!—can set up a fabric mask-masking factory at home. Face coverings are in high demand everywhere, especially in health-care settings. And even if you don’t know of a specific location to donate, you can sell them and turn the proceeds over to charity. (Maybe this is the lemonade stand of 2020?)If you and your kids aren’t comfortable around needles, don’t freak out. There are loads of no-sew options to experiment with. National craft supply store Michaels even shares ideas, like this one, which involves slicing up an old T-shirt. Or invent your own design using pipe cleaners or whatever else you can find in your junk drawer. Funky handmade masks might be the push your kids need to actually wear them when you leave the house. Just make sure the masks are made following basic safety standards.When you’re ready for another project, put those same skills to work for Project Linus, a 25-year-old organization that has sent more than eight million homemade security blankets to kids who are sick or have experienced trauma. “Blankets make them feel like someone cares,” says National President Patty Gregory. And that someone can be any age. “We have volunteers as young as four,” she adds. “Anybody can do this.”The Project Linus website offers more complex patterns for quilts and afghans as well as step-by-step instructions for two “no sew fleece blankets” that require little more than fabric and scissors. “If you can tie your shoes, you can make a fleece blanket,” Gregory says.Local chapters often get flooded with these simpler kinds of blankets, so it’s best to check if yours is accepting them at the moment. And be aware that many drop-off sites have been affected by general coronavirus restrictions and closures. Gregory’s advice is to keep making blankets, even if you need to hold on to them for a little bit, or contact local shelters near you to see if they’re accepting blankets or other supplies.Everybody likes getting a handwritten note, especially when it includes colorful doodles. Instead of adding to the refrigerator art gallery, get your kids to stuff their masterpieces into envelopes destined for isolated seniors. Lots of nursing homes and hospices are welcoming such letters, as is the organization Love for the Elderly, which sorts and distributes its haul where needed. (Another option: Shoot a video to share a message of support through the website Care Not Covid.)Of course plenty of people deserve thank-yous: teachers, doctors, nurses, postal workers. Ask your kids to think about why they’re grateful for these folks, and write up a ton of letters. Then ask one or two who you interact with to pass them along to their co-workers.That’s basically the model that’s used by A Million Thanks, which has sent more than 10 million letters to U.S. military deployed around the world. The group bundles a box of about 1,000 letters and sends them to a specific service member, who then distributes through his or her unit. (Because of COVID-19, no letters are being sent at the moment, but founder Shauna Fleming hopes to be collecting again by late summer or early fall.)A letter might be small, but it can have a significant impact. “I had one soldier say he’d rather get letters than food on a daily basis,” Fleming says.Make volunteering part of your daily life by welcoming a furry new member of the family, even if it’s only temporary.Animal rescues have recently seen a spike in interest in fostering dogs and cats—in fact the ASPCA reports a nearly 70 percent increase in animals going into foster care through its New York City and Los Angeles programs, compared to the same period in 2019.ASPCA President and CEO Matt Bershadker notes that when you foster a pet at home, you’re freeing up space at shelters for other animals, plus easing the burden on the human staff members who must now operate in compliance with social distance requirements. Every shelter handles its foster program differently, but Bershadker says most volunteers care for an animal at home from two weeks to a few months.Kids who learn to take dogs on walks, clean out kitty litter boxes, and just spend time with animals are developing lifelong skills, says Lauren Lipsey, vice president of community programs at the Humane Rescue Alliance in Washington, D.C. If fostering can’t work—for logistical or health reasons—families can help out in other ways. Lipsey recommends kids round up supplies, including corks (cats love ’em as toys) and food, to donate.",
"When COVID-19 forced schools to shut down in spring 2020—and kept many closed throughout the next school year—Susan Darrow was worried that music instruction would be left behind.“Many schools still approach the arts and music as something that’s extra,” explains the CEO of the early childhood program Music Together. “It’s [often] the first thing to get cut.”So when she began to receive requests from both parents and schools for music resources, she was excited to move her program’s classes online—especially since she believes that children need music now more than ever.“Music can help us relieve stress naturally,” she says. “If you think about what happens when you sing a song in your car or dance around the kitchen, you instantly feel better. That’s because feel-good chemicals are released when we sing and dance, and music connects us to others. These are all things we’re looking for right now.”And even though in-person music lessons, band practices, and choir groups may be canceled or limited because of pandemic-related closures, parents can still incorporate music into kids’ everyday routines. These small, easy ideas can have big benefits.After all, we were born musical creatures. “Music-making is one of the very few things that appears in every culture, every region, and every people throughout history,” Darrow says. “What that should tell us is that being musical is part of being human.”In fact, studies show that music serves similar functions in different cultures around the world—we use it to soothe babies, dance, heal, and express love. One study found that Canadians could accurately identify sadness, joy, and anger in classical Indian ragas, suggesting music is a sort of transcendent language.From an evolutionary perspective, early humans engaged in music as a bonding activity that promoted social cohesion—the kind of group cooperation that allowed us to survive and flourish as a species. So it’s no surprise that we’re hardwired to respond to music.But music provides benefits that go beyond social bonding—it affects us on a biological level.For instance, engaging in pleasurable musical activities release reinforcing, feel-good hormones like endorphins and dopamine, which might explain why adults who move in sync to music report liking each other better and trusting each other more. In studies of preterm infants in intensive care, listening to music stabilized heart and respiratory rates, improved feeding and weight gain, and led to more mature sleep patterns. And people who participate in music therapy with licensed practitioners have shown improvement in mood and concentration, and have experienced reduced pain, anxiety, fatigue, and the stress hormone cortisol—without the use of medication.In children, playing a musical instrument is associated with improved organization and growth of the brain areas responsible for thinking, memory, emotion regulation, and motor coordination. “Music learning supports all learning,” Darrow says. “There’s almost nothing you can do that lights up parts of the brain the way music does.”These benefits aren’t just limited to educational settings. Research shows that simply listening to music engages both hemispheres of the brain, activates the body’s reward system, and facilitates brain development regardless of whether children receive formal training or not.Think of incorporating music into your child’s everyday life as part of a wellness intervention that can build resilience at a time when kids are experiencing significant stress. “What if you prescribed music, exercise, nutrition, healthy sleep, and breathing [techniques]?” says James Hudziak, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics, and medicine at the University of Vermont. “Instead of bad things negatively affecting the brain, good things can affect it.”And regardless of whether your children had in-person instruction or are just beginning their musical journey, Darrow says the most important teacher is often Mom and Dad. “Let your child hear and see you singing, let them see you dancing,” she says.Parents should make music a natural, everyday habit. “I know families who do a regular family dance party every night after dinner—you just put music on, and everybody jams in the living room. Have a family kitchen jam session with pots and pans and spatulas. Establish a nightly ritual of singing your child to sleep.”For parents who aren’t musically inclined, Darrow has good news: “It doesn’t matter how well you do it. As a parent, if you can’t sing in tune or keep a beat, your child doesn’t learn how to sing from you, but do learn to love to sing from you.”Hudziak encourages families to dedicate a few minutes to music appreciation every day, whether that’s practicing an instrument or watching a live stream. It can even be as simple as listening to music and tapping a foot, singing along to a song, or bobbing up and down. He also recommends these music engagement activities from the Vermont Center for Children,Youth, and Families.Introduce kids to a variety of genres, and practice mindful listening so they’re paying attention to music without other distractions. Plenty of free online resources can help. The Metropolitan Opera is offering free opera streams, the Berliner Philharmoniker has a free digital playlist, and full episodes of the kids’ music series, Mister Chris and Friends, are available on PBS.The key, Hudziak says, is to make sure kids don’t feel pressured to perform like professionals—make it fun. “We made music training a joy, a benefit,” Hudziak says. “This is called incentive-based behavioral training” and can use techniques such as rewarding an hour of music practice or engagement with extra time to play a video game. This not only reinforces the positive behavior but can eventually lead kids to pursue healthy activities on their own because the activities themselves become intrinsically rewarding. (Here are some tips on using rewards the right way.)“If you believe bad things will lead to bad outcomes, then you have to believe good things may lead to good outcomes,” Hudziak says. “By not having music, exercise, breathing, and good sleep hygiene, we’re actually contributing to … emotional problems and academic decline. There’s no greater joy than bringing music to someone and watching it turn their life around.”",
"So you hear in August that your child’s school will reopen for in-person classes—but are given no date. Then you’re told September 10. Then September 21. Finally, your kid goes back to school on September 29 … and learns a few days later she’ll be getting sent home again.Most families probably aren’t experiencing the extreme reopening whiplash that some New York City children recently faced. But as more schools cautiously begin in-class learning, the likelihood of a school slamming shut again because of a COVID-19 outbreak remains ever present. And that sudden change can be difficult on children.“Kids thrive when they can count on the adults around them to provide structure, warmth, guidance, and predictability,” says Mary Alvord, co-author of the Resilience Builder for Children and Adolescents. “What is difficult is when there is constant uncertainty and change.”Children’s lives have been in a state of flux since the pandemic started shutting down schools and other activities in the spring. Routines disappeared seemingly overnight, and even now plans can feel iffy at best. The only constant in the lives of most now is change.“And it’s not just the pandemic at play here,” Alvord says. “Racial tensions, economic losses and instability, and tremendous politic divisiveness … all of it affects our kids.”That’s why even children who bounced back from canceled graduations and end-of-year concerts just a few months ago might now be struggling.“For both kids and their parents, a lot of their coping skills have been really challenged at this time,” says family therapist Ulash Dunlap. “The tools you had before might not be working anymore. It may be time for new ones.”The ability to deal with sudden change is key to mental health, Dunlap says. But the skills needed to do that require practice. “Resiliency is like a muscle,” she adds. “If we don’t use it, or if we don’t know how to use it, we may need a bit of help to build strategies that work it out.”Luckily parents can encourage children to practice coping skills that will help them better navigate sudden change and uncertainty, Alvord says. “The key is to be mentally flexible, learn how to problem-solve, and accept change as a challenge rather than an obstacle.”Experts agree that resilient children will have an easier time dealing with whatever the pandemic throws at them—and will be stronger at the end of it. Here are some coping techniques parents can practice with their children when faced with sudden change.Alvord advises starting by encouraging something called “mental flexibility,” what we might think of as the ability to go with the flow. She defines it as the ability to come up with many different solutions or ways of thinking about a challenge or situation.“The aim is to have balanced and helpful thinking,” she says. Kids who can come up with multiple possibilities to an outcome rather than having an “all-is-doomed” outlook are more resilient, she adds. Some language to try:What’s the reaction from your child when hearing disappointing news? Do they blow up, or do they roll with the punches? “Kids who can only see what can go wrong and don’t feel they have any control in situations are more likely to feel hopeless and depressed,” Alvord says.No matter what the sudden change a child is dealing with, the event is a great opportunity for parents to encourage kids to problem-solve their new situation.Alvord suggests parents ask their kids: “What are some options we have? What can we try?” Switching kids from focusing on what’s gone wrong to what they can do to make the best of a sudden change replaces helplessness with empowerment.“There’s so much that we can feel helpless about around COVID-19,” Alvord says. “But we can also feel like ‘We did what we could.’”Still, Alvord advises that parents resist the temptation to rush in and assist kids as they navigate a sudden change. For instance, when the camera shuts off in the middle of the virtual chat, steer your child toward the solution—emailing the teacher or posting in the chat room—rather than hopping on and doing it yourself.Even though it might take longer, giving them room to work it out and complimenting them when they use the skills you’re trying to teach will give them confidence that they can overcome these challenges—even if that means not helping out when they’re burning lunch.“I just have to let it go because they're going to learn from that, that they shouldn't have been on their phone when they had something on the stove,” says Nadine Araksi Silverthorne, co-founder of life coaching firm Kickstartology. “Each time they learn on their own, they're building that resilience muscle because they're learning to trust themselves.”Parents won’t always be around when a sudden change happens—and sometimes even if they are, they need to give kids the space to figure things out on their own.“I think overall the important thing is helping your kids understand that while [no one] can control everything, there are many things that they can do to improve their lives and the situation,” Alvord says.Kids who consider change as a challenge they can face—rather than an obstacle they can’t overcome—will be better able to navigate the situation.“When you think, ‘I can try, or I have dealt with change before, I can do it again,’ it’s empowering,” Alvord says.Dunlap says that parents can also help children feel like they’re taking back some power in an out-of-control situation by teaching them techniques to use anytime they’re feeling frustrated. Putting down their pencils, square breathing, or setting devices to do not disturb can help them battle mental negativity whenever it creeps in.Another technique: Put up a white board and encourage kids to write notes about what’s going well that day. The visual cues can be uplifting.Dealing with change means kids need to recognize and counter harmful thoughts that come with anxiety about their new situation. (“You’re going to fail at remote learning.” “You’ll never play with your friends again.”)When those ideas arise, Alvord suggests you have them answer questions like:And if those destructive thoughts still seep through? Ask the child, “What would you tell your friend if they were saying these things?” Alvord says. Teach your kids to treat themselves just as kindly.Change often means routines are disrupted yet again, but that stability is crucial for a child’s mental and physical well-being.If yet another change has upended a carefully managed routine, Alvord recommends figuring out a new schedule as soon as possible. As much as you can, maintain regular bedtimes, dinner times, and movement breaks. (Here’s an article about how kids can play outside.)Maintaining connections to kids’ friends and community is another way to help children feel more stable in the face of constant change. “Those connections and support systems are critical,” Alvord says, “especially now, with COVID-19, when people are feeling more isolated.”And as new stressors arise, it will be normal for kids to slip out of their routine—it’s OK to gently remind them to practice the skills they’ve learned.“All of our coping skills are being challenged right now, but it’s never too late to improve,” Dunlap says. “We can all benefit from new tools that help.”",
"Margaret McDonnell was leading a conference call for work when her seven-year-old daughter Mickey needed help submitting her digital assignment. But the Takoma Park, Maryland, mom wasn’t any better at navigating the virtual school’s portals and platforms, and they were both becoming frustrated.Luckily, nine-year-old brother James jumped in and taught his younger sister how to find what she was looking for. “What’s amazing is that it worked well for both of them,” McDonnell says. “It made my older child feel like the leader, and my daughter was grateful to have her brother’s help.”Younger kids have always looked to their older counterparts for advice, often instead of relying on parents or other trusted adults. “Because children use similar language and communication styles, they have a way of relating to one another that helps them learn better,” says Montessori educator Elenore Pfefferman, who teaches in a mixed-age Washington, D.C., classroom. “The children quickly learn to seek help from classmates, and that benefits everyone.”In these pandemic times—when adults definitely don’t always have all the answers to children’s many questions—who better than middle schoolers to help bridge the gap? We reached out to these “experts” about the life advice they’d give to kids during the pandemic. Here’s what they had to say.Do what you love: Just because they’re kids doesn’t mean they’re not stressed out. Eighth grader Alex Ingvoldstad quickly found this out—and came up with a very grown-up solution.“I’ve been very stressed out this year,” says the 14-year-old from Omaha. “I was forgetting to take time out for myself.”She noticed right away that she felt better after setting aside her schoolwork to do things she loves. “I’ve been calling my friends and practicing the instruments I play— saxophone and ukulele. And I’ve been reading too,” she says. That’s advice any kid can take.Have a plan and ask for help. Eighth grader Bilal Williamson has advice for kids who will start in-person school soon: “It’s going to be hard, but do as much as you can to get ready,” says the 13-year-old from Hagerstown, Maryland. It’s what he told his two younger sisters when they started back a few weeks after he did.Though every school will be different, Bilal says that preparing mentally for a different way of going to school will help the transition. “In [my] cafeteria, there are X’s on the seats where you can sit,” he says. “During lunch you have to stay six feet apart and talk with your mask on and don’t touch anything.”And once you are back in school, embrace the support that teachers and counselors are offering. “They’re there to help us,” he says.Get creative. Mirabelle DeAngelis is diligent about following her school’s rules for in-person learning—staying at least six feet apart from others, washing her hands often, and, of course, wearing a mask. But for the seventh grader from Davie, Florida, wearing a mask is more than a safety rule—it’s also an outlet for problem solving and creativity.“When you take off your mask to drink water, you don't really have anywhere to put it. You don’t want to put it on the table because that's dirty,” she says. “I made myself a ‘mask-lace.’ It’s a chain with beads that clips on the straps of my mask. When I take it off, it hangs like a necklace so I don’t lose it.”It was perfect advice for Mirabelle’s nine-year-old sister, Astrid, who will be headed back to school in person next month wearing one of her sister’s creations.OMG, don’t h8 typing: Like most middle schoolers, Dior Kiler isn’t a stickler for proper spelling and punctuation when it comes to texting. She admits that before the pandemic, her improper grammar would sometimes show up in her schoolwork.But virtual school means the 12-year-old from the Bronx is communicating by keyboard much more often—and she soon realized that she needed to improve her skills. “I’ve gotten better at typing on my phone and on my laptop, and now I know where all the keys are.”Her advice to newbie texters: “Don’t shorten your sentences with the abbreviations,” she says. “Spell out what you’re going to say so you don’t develop bad habits.”Take breaks. Alexa Jackson, a 13-year-old seventh grader from Takoma Park, Maryland, was overwhelmed when she first faced the challenge of a totally virtual classroom. Without mental breaks—like changing classes or teacher-led interruptions—she worried that she'd feel pressure to always be doing schoolwork. That made her feel exhausted, and she soon fell behind.After negotiating a compromise with her mom, Alexa learned to pace herself. “I used to not like being on Zoom calls, so my mom would say, ‘I'll let you watch TV for 20 minutes, if you get on your Zoom call.’”Once she built in time in her schedule for both schoolwork and fun breaks, she quickly caught up.“Try to think on the good side, and don’t just go straight to, ‘I don't want to do this,’” she advises. “Think of it like you’re eating pizza: You have so many more pieces left, but you’re starting to get tired of eating pizza. Wait a few minutes, then when you get hungry again, eat some more pizza. Don't give up halfway.”Make your own fun: Heading outside for recess is the highlight of the day for 12-year-old Matteo Valiante. But the social distancing rules can sometimes make playing with friends challenging. That’s why the sixth grader from Norwalk, Connecticut, advises kids to get creative when it comes to fun.“We make paper darts and pretend they're footballs and throw them around,” says Matteo, who’s in physical school part of the week. “And we roll down the hill and get grass all over ourselves because we don’t know what else do to.”",
"Los Angeles mom Erica Medine thought life was going to get easier once distance learning ended for the summer. Instead, things got even harder.“School gave us something to do, and now there’s no structure,” says Medine, who has an eight-year-old daughter. “My patience is wearing thin because she’s always fed up, and her patience is wearing thin because she doesn’t know when this is going to end.”A lot of parents can relate. Things were stressful enough when they became de facto teachers on top of full-time parents and workers, but many kids seem even more restless now that school is out. Experts say we’re still far from getting back to normal. How can you tell your kids to be patient when everyone feels ready to explode?First, understand that kids throwing tantrums or acting out isn’t unusual during these times. “Those negative emotions are appropriate,” says Sarah A. Schnitker, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University. After all, even adults don’t know when the pandemic will end. “For kids, such a long time frame can feel like forever,” she says.And now, without schoolwork to keep kids occupied, impatience can really build up. “Ordinarily, we’d expect negative emotions for a day if a child is adjusting to a change,” says Romie Mushtaq, a neurologist and mindfulness expert based in Orlando. “But if the emotions persist, that means kids’ stress response—the ‘fight or flight’ reaction—hasn’t turned off.” While the waiting goes on and on, stress hormones such as cortisol keep being released in kids’ brains. “They never get to reset to a place of calm,” she says.The good news is that patience can be learned—and its benefits can be huge.You already know patience can help keep your family’s emotional pot from boiling over. But you might not guess its other payoffs.Schnitker’s own studies reveal that patience is correlated with increased hope, less depression and loneliness, and higher self-esteem—all things that could benefit kids during this stressful time. Plus there’s a long-term benefit: It could help your kids achieve future goals. “We found that when people are patient in pursuit of their goals, they actually exert more effort,” Schnitker says.And even when being patient feels impossible, you can remind kids that waiting has value too.“Waiting unlocks new ways of thinking,” says Jason Farman, author of Delayed Response: The Art of Waiting From the Ancient to the Instant World. He points to a brain network dubbed the “imagination network.” “It only kicks in when you’re bored or daydreaming,” he says. "It really unlocks creativity you can’t access otherwise.” (Here’s an article about putting kids’ boredom to good use.)Patience is something kids can learn bit by bit. But remember one crucial point: to teach it, the grown-ups have to learn it too.“I always tell parents the first three steps are this: A parent must learn to remain calm. A parent must learn to remain calm. And a parent must learn to remain calm,” Mushtaq says. “Eighty percent of our communication is nonverbal body language.” She recommends starting a simple mindfulness practice like the “brain breaks” below; meditation apps can also help. Still not feeling it? “Fake it till you make it” can be a useful mantra in calming the family.Schnitker says the next step is giving kids a reason to try patience. “It’s getting the ‘why’ alongside the ‘how,’” she says. “I have a four-year-old, and we try to intentionally talk about the big-purpose things in our lives, such as caring for other people.” You might tell impatient kids that while you understand they’re feeling bored or frustrated, you sometimes need to work and take care of yourself too.Another helpful step is being clear about when day-to-day events start and end. “One of the things that came out of my research is that providing people feedback improves anxiety during wait times,” Farman says. This could mean telling kids start and end times for your conference calls, or providing a daily schedule—even a loose one—around things like meal times, pool time, or outside time. Farman compares this to waiting for a website to load. “If you get a percent bar, that level of feedback engages us, calms us down, and gives us agency over how we can use our time.”Allowing kids to let out emotions is another key. “How often do we say, ‘You need to calm down?’” asks Mushtaq. In fact, this only prolongs negative emotions, both for adults and children. "When we allow an emotion to be present, it lasts for just about 90 seconds,” she says.Parents and kids can do a lot to make it feel like time is going by faster. Here are the experts’ ideas.Reconnect. Although distance learning isn't the same as an in-person classroom, kids still saw each other regularly and now might be feeling the loss of social connection. “Children thrive on three things: time, touch, and attention,” says child development expert Roni Cohen Leiderman, dean of Nova Southeastern University’s Mailman Segal Center for Human Development. Leiderman advises prepping meals together, taking the kids when you walk the dog, reading books, or doing puzzles. “It’s about making sure you disconnect from work to connect with your family,” she says, even if that means taking a break every few hours to spend a few moments with your kids.Get together. As it gets safer, you may be able to bring back much-wanted playdates, with precautions. “For children old enough to understand and follow safety rules, consider a social-distanced playdate while wearing masks,” Leiderman says. “Your kids will be in their safe bubble, but they’ll be interacting with other children too.” Medine has been trying this outside with two trusted friends.Start a project. Having time to fill can mean an opportunity for kids to pursue longer projects they’ve never tried. “This is a good time to observe your children and find their passion,” Leiderman says. “My granddaughter discovered baking, and my grandson is teaching himself to play the piano.” Learning a language, starting a garden, writing a book, or even getting an early start on a Halloween costume can help time pass and give shape to the days.Take a brain break. Mushtaq teaches this beginning mindfulness practice for young kids: Try gazing at one thing for three to five minutes, such as clouds in the sky. (Check out these cloud-watching activities.) “We call it a brain break,” Mushtaq says. For third graders and up, Mushtaq teaches “square breathing,” which is inhaling for four counts, holding the breath for four counts, exhaling for four, and holding for four. “When we do it for three minutes, it brings down our stress levels, and brings up hormones that help us to feel calm.”Medine is adding mindfulness breaks to her daughter’s days with daily walks. Still, having some down days is normal. “Being patient doesn’t mean kids never feel those negative emotions,” Schnitker says. “But they can take those feelings, pause, and do something constructive with them. And we can do that as adults too.”.",
"It might sound super retro, but cloud watching actually has lots of benefits for children. Of course, being able to spot and understand the different types of clouds is a fun, accessible way to teach kids valuable science skills—and maybe even how to predict the weather. It fosters observation skills and creativity as well.But skimming the skies can also be healthy for kids’ mental health, something experts say children need especially now as they deal with the stress and tension that's been building up over the past few years.“Their sympathetic nervous system—that fight or flight or freeze mode—is on all the time,” says Megan Tudor, assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of California Davis MIND Institute. “We have to give children a chance to turn it off, to just relax. And cloud watching is perfect for that.”The good news is you don’t need to force kids to memorize the 10 different kinds of clouds (’cause who wants to do that on summer vacation?). The goal is for kids to simply understand what’s happening in the sky.“I’d much rather that children have some idea of what’s going on,” says Jon Ahlquist, associate professor of meteorology at Florida State University. “Otherwise you’re just learning definitions. The important thing is to learn what all this means.”For instance, high, wispy “cirrus” clouds don’t bring rain. But if kids observe fluffy “cumulus” clouds getting taller and darker at the base throughout the day, watch out! “That means they might be developing into thunderstorms, which can bring heavy rain,” says Sonia Lasher-Trapp, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.Whether you’ve got a budding meteorologist or a kid with, well, his head in the clouds, these ideas can help your children chill out—while maybe learning a little science.If kids really want to nerd out on identifying different types of clouds, the National Weather Service has a fun printable cloud wheel craft. (Just rotate the wheel to match the cloud you’re seeing for its name and description.) No color printer? Online cloud atlases like the ones here and here can help too.Once your kids are ready to roll, arm them with these questions so they can make the most out of their cloud-watching experience. (Check out a photo gallery and get facts about cloud types.)What color is it? When you look up at cumulus clouds (the fluffy ones), you’re seeing the bottom of the cloud, Lasher-Trapp says. “Are they darker on the bottom? That indicates that the cloud contains a lot more water that can be made into precipitation soon.”The more water inside a cloud, the thicker it will be. So the darkness of the cloud is a good hint to understand thickness—which can predict rainfall. “The darker the cloud, the thicker it is,” Ahlquist says. “If the cloud isn’t very thick, you’re not going to get much rain out of it.” With continued observation, kids can tell how thick a cloud needs to be before you get more than a sprinkle.What shape is it? If it’s wispy (called a cirrus cloud) and late in the day, you’re probably seeing the remnants of old thunderstorms, especially if it’s summertime and you’re in the South, Ahlquist says. On the other hand, if you’re in the Midwest, a front might be on the way.Are the clouds moving? If you’ve heard that a warm or cold front is coming through your area, ask kids to observe what’s happening in the sky. “As fronts come through, you can see the cloud types change,” Lasher-Trapp says. And that might help them forecast the weather.Have children try this trick if clouds at two different levels are moving in different directions. Face the direction the lower level cloud is moving. If you have to turn counterclockwise to turn to the direction that the upper-level cloud is moving in, that means that colder air is blowing between those layers. If you have to turn clockwise, warmer air is blowing. Ahlquist says the same thing is likely happening on the ground, so kids can predict if it’s about to be warmer or colder.If your child just can’t get into the science of clouds, that’s OK. Cloud watching offers ways to exercise their brains in a different way by fostering creativity. And during tense times, that’s just as important as learning science. “For young children especially, creativity is one of the most important forms of relaxation,” Tudor says. Here are some ideas to have your kids try to foster cloud-based creativity.—Have them photograph all the different types of clouds they spot in 5, 15, or 30 minutes for a virtual cloud collection.—Let them take a sketchpad and pencil outside and draw the types of clouds they see. Use the basic cloud shapes to create other images. (A witch with wispy cirrus cloud hair? A train puffing out cumulus smoke?)—Challenge them to give each type of cloud a new name. Kids can base the new monikers on mythology, cartoon characters, or even their friends.—See if they can make up a story about the clouds, adding different scenes as the clouds change.—Ask them to pretend that clouds are watching us. How would clouds describe mountains and rivers and other things they see on Earth from their view in the sky?",
"From giant puffs billowing toward the sun to thin wisps slinking past the moon, clouds come in countless shapes and sizes. This makes them wonderful fodder for the imagination—at some point, hasn’t everyone looked heavenward and seen a fire-breathing dragon floating by? Aside from sparking creativity, clouds serve several important scientific purposes, from helping meteorologists predict the weather to facilitating life on Earth.The building blocks of clouds are water and particles—of dust, dirt, or sea salt—known as cloud condensation nuclei. These nuclei are everywhere in the atmosphere. They attract water vapor and as they ascend the vapor condenses to form liquid water or ice, which results in the formation of tiny globules called cloud droplets. Much smaller than raindrops, cloud droplets are extremely light and amass while they float, mixing with air to form the fluffy formations we see suspended in the sky.Clouds generally form within the troposphere, or the layer of atmosphere closest to the earth. As they rise and fall, they may appear in infinite variations. To create some order scientists have established three broad categories into which most clouds can be grouped.At the upper reaches of the troposphere you’ll find high clouds, which, depending on geographic location, occur between roughly 10,000 and 60,000 feet. Below that is the home of mid-level clouds, which generally occur between 6,000 and 25,000 feet. Finally, closest to Earth’s surface are low clouds, which hover at or below 6,500 feet.Within each of these three tiers, scientists further organize clouds into ten broad categories based on the general shapes the clouds take.High clouds are classified as either cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus. Cirrus clouds are made of ice crystals and appear thin, white, and wispy. Cirrostratus clouds are whitish and transparent and tend to blanket the whole sky, sometimes creating a halo effect around the sun or moon. Cirrocumulus clouds are also white and can be sheet-like and rippled.Mid-level clouds are usually gray and are identified as either altocumulus, altostratus, or nimbostratus. Altocumulus clouds are full of liquid water but generally do not produce rain. They are patchy and often appear as ripples or rows. Altostratus clouds cover the sky but are darker than cirrostratus clouds and may give the sun or moon a fuzzy appearance. Altostratus clouds may portend a storm. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark and can produce both rain and snow.Low clouds fall into four divisions: cumulus, stratus, cumulonimbus, and stratocumulus. Cumulus clouds are a cloud-spotting favorite: They are big, white, and cottony and—depending on your imagination—may look like a bear, an apple, or any other familiar object. Cumulonimbus clouds are heavy and dense; they tend to build dramatically upward and are often harbingers of thunderstorms, hail, or tornadoes. Stratus clouds appear as a thin gray layer in the sky. Stratocumulus clouds are patchy, gray and white, and usually resemble a honeycomb.Of course, all of the clouds that exist can’t be contained within such limited parameters. Ever see one that looks like undulating waves? That’s called a Kelvin-Helmholtz cloud, named for the physicists who first studied its flowing formation. How about those pouch-like protrusions bulging from underneath larger clouds? Those are called mammatus clouds. Contrails are long bands of clouds produced by aircraft. Otherworldly looking lenticular clouds resemble stacks of giant disks rising in the sky.No matter what shape or size they are, clouds are essential to life on Earth. During the day they help protect us from the sun’s intense heat. At night they act as a blanket to keep us from getting too cold. They also provide precipitation and signal weather changes and patterns.But clouds aren’t unique to our planet. Astrophysicists who study atmospheres on other planets know that Mars, for example, has clouds similar to ours. Continuing to learn about weather on other worlds, they believe, will help us better understand—and predict—our own.",
"There’s just something about dinosaurs. They’re big, mysterious, and long gone—mostly. “Paleontology is a bit like piecing together this puzzle of the past,” says Kristen Olson, senior coordinator of curriculum and content at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “It’s a little bit mysterious and relies so much on discovery.”Searching locally for fossils and artifacts with kids can be an epic journey—and inspire curiosity and exploration. Here’s what you need to know to get started on a junior fossil-hunting expedition, plus five extra activities for kids who love ancient life.Take heart, parents: You don’t need to know it all before you begin. Still, a bit of knowledge will set you off on the right track—and make you seem like a genius to your children.Basically, a fossil is the remnant of ancient life. “They’re the remains of an extinct plant or animal or some trace of their behavior, like a footprint or fossilized poop,” explains paleontologist Scott Sampson, director of the California Academy of Sciences and author of the Nat Geo Kids book You Can Be a Paleontologist!Body fossils are the actual remains of the creature, like bones; trace fossils are signs of the creature, like imprints of feathers. The basic formula for creating a fossil goes something like this: a living thing dies, the soft parts decay, sedimentary rock builds on top of what’s left, and water seeps into the bones and teeth to turn it to stone. Sometimes, water dissolves the bone or shell and leaves an imprint on the rock.While dinosaurs grab fossil glory, most fossils are actually something else, like trilobites from the sea and ancient insects sealed in amber. All fossils build an important bridge from past to present. “Any fossil we find helps remind us that we’re a piece of that narrative,” Sampson says.Dedicated gear is not only fuel for excitement, but it also adds seriousness to the expedition. Pack a backpack with a shovel, a small hammer or chisel, and brushes to excavate your finds. Bring a notebook, pencils, and a camera for documentation. Don’t forget sunscreen, snacks, a hat, and water since many fossil-friendly spots don’t offer much shade.The best fossil spots vary by region, so it helps to do a bit of research ahead of time. “You’ve got to have sedimentary rocks [that is, rocks that were formed by deposits of sediment], and they’ve got to be exposed,” Sampson says.Often, these are places where an ancient river flooded and then retreated into its channel, leaving behind layers of shale, sandstone, or limestone and, with it, fossils. To find nearby fossil-friendly spots, check out a geological survey or a paleogeographic map.Look for places where rocks from long ago might be at the surface. Dirt-filled forests or newly landscaped locations will make your search more challenging. Deserts, quarries, or spaces where the earth has been split—like where roads have been cut into mountains or in cliffs along rivers—are great spots.Steer clear of national and state parks—unless you’re venturing to one that specifically allows fossil collecting. Also stay away from private property or public spaces where digging would be problematic, like sports fields.Children have a natural advantage when it comes to amateur fossil hunting: They’re closer to the ground, have better eyesight, and are curious about their surroundings. “Kids are just natural scientists,” says Ilana April, senior manager of early childhood education at the American Museum of Natural History. “They’re born with a curiosity about the world around them.”Of course, the chance of a child stumbling across a gigantic dinosaur skull is very, very small. In fact, because so many types of fossils exist, it’s hard for experts to describe what exactly to look for. That’s why April suggests that kids start their search simply by looking slowly and carefully along the ground. “The most important tool scientists have might be their eyes,” April says.Then, stay on the lookout for interesting designs, patterns, and textures. “I look for symmetry,” says Paul Mayer, paleontologist and collections manager for fossil invertebrates at Chicago’s Field Museum, “You want to train your eye to look for nice lines.”For example, many shell fossils will have bilateral symmetry, so the left will be a mirror image of the right. Other times, texture will be the key.“The fossil portion of a rock might be smooth or a different color than the rest,” Mayer says. “It might really stand out, like a chocolate chip in cookie dough. Sometimes you’ll find it separate from a rock, but oftentimes you’ll find a fossil in the rock itself.”If your kid spots something promising, have them use the shovel to dig out any half-buried rocks; the hammer and chisel will break away portions of rock that might expose a fossil, and the brush will wipe away any debris or dust.After their discovery, kids should document the location and date of the find—and a description of the rock around it. “Someone else could figure out what the species or fossil is, but they’ll never know where you found it,” Mayer says.After that, kids can try to figure out if their discovery is truly a fossil—and, if so, what exactly it is. If they think it’s a dinosaur bone, have a lick. Bones will stick to their tongue, while rock won’t. For deeper research, kids can also try traditional sources (like these books from Nat Geo Kids) or—under your supervision—fossil-hunting communities like the My Fossil emuseum.The most important lesson of fossil hunting is to keep at it. “You never know what you’re going to find,” Mayer says. “The more rocks you look at and pick up, the better your chances are of finding a fossil.”Discovering the world of dinosaurs and ancient living things isn’t just about digging. Here are five other activities to connect with the past.Track living dinosaurs. Blow your kids’ minds by tossing out this fact: Dinosaurs exist today as birds. Take your kids bird-watching and see if they can find similarities between the dinosaurs in their books and the ones in the trees.Search for ancient plants. “Certain species of plants that grow today were also around during the Ice Age and eaten by giant sloths and mammoths,” Olson says. Look for trees like Osage orange, honey locusts, magnolias, avocados, and even ferns, then imagine what creatures might have been chowing down on them millions of years ago.Find fossils of the future. Insects still get stuck in tree sap, under a rock, or inside tar (even if it’s just on your driveway). Have kids search for fossils-in-the-making to compare with ancient versions.Create a fossil record. If your kid’s find is in a protected space—or you just don’t want a bunch of rocks cluttering up the house—create a memento with an old-school rubbing technique. Hold paper against the unique portion of the rock and rub against the section with a crayon, marking what is raised. (Even if they don’t find a fossil, doing this activity with things like tree bark, leaves, or textured stone is still a great way to capture an adventure.)Trace nature’s patterns. Paleontologists use fossil finds to understand the behavior of ancient living things. Have kids use their own investigative skills—and a bit of creativity—to follow clues that today’s creatures might leave behind. For example, broken acorns could mean a nearby squirrel’s nest—or nearby poop.",
"Your kids might already know that Tyrannosaurus rex could gulp a hundred pounds of meat in one bite or that Brachiosaurus would be able to peek through the windows of a four-story building. But with about 700 described species so far, there’s a lot they don’t know—and a lot that will shock them.Paleontologist and Nat Geo Explorer Steve Brusatte became obsessed with dinosaurs as a kid when he realized that actual dino discoveries contradicted what he had seen in outdated books. “The dinosaurs they were finding and describing at the time were so different from the dinos that were in all the tired old books in the library,” Brusatte says. “And we’re finding out even more information right now.”Show kids that there’s always more to learn by revealing these 10 shocking dino secrets—and make yourself look like a genius in the meantime.Baby Tyrannosaurs were probably really cute. Kids likely know that this dino king stomped and chomped its way through what’s now western North America. But a Tyrannosaurus rex hatchling? Unexpectedly adorable, according to recreations from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.No bigger than a skinny turkey with a superlong tail, the duckling-like T. rex baby would’ve hatched covered in a layer of fuzzy, downy feathers. As it grew, the older, not-so-cute teenage dino would gain almost five pounds a day, eventually topping out around 40 feet long at age 20.Many adult dinos were feathered, too. Toss out the idea that all dinos were covered in scaly skin—those recreations might be like drawing a tiger without its fur. “A lot of dinosaurs had feathers,” Brusatte says. “Some species used them for display—sticking out their arms to attract mates or intimidate rivals.”The largest known fully feathered dino—a 30-foot-long T. rex cousin called Yutyrannus huali—likely used its feathers to keep warm. But other species had flight feathers. These early birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the asteroid that killed the rest of these animals 66 million years ago. That warbler in your backyard? Turns out it’s a T. rex cousin, too.They were colorful. Most pictures kids see of dinosaurs depict them as gray or brown reptiles. But new research techniques in the last few decades have revealed a colorful prehistoric world. For instance, a turkey-size dino called Sinosauropteryx likely had an orange-and-white striped tail. And experts think a dinosaur named Caihong juji  might’ve had rainbow-colored, iridescent, shiny feathers on its neck and chest.To figure this out, scientists examined the remains of a part of a cell that once contained melanin, the same pigment that gives humans our hair, eye, and skin color. “We never thought we’d be able to learn what colors the dinosaurs really were,” Brusatte says.You drink the same water as dinosaurs. Water on Earth arrived billions of years ago—perhaps as ice on meteorites that slammed into the still-forming planet. And the water molecules have been evaporating, condensing into clouds, and precipitating in a cycle ever since. That means your kids are drinking the same water that the dinos did.Some dinosaurs were tiny. Your kids might assume that all dinosaurs were as big as a highway truck. But one of the smaller known dinos, Microraptor, was little enough to hold in an adult’s hands. Weighing about two pounds, this compact carnivore had flight feathers on both its front and rear legs, likely allowing it to glide from branch to branch.They sometimes got the sniffles. Can your kid imagine snot dripping from gigantic nostrils and hacking coughs shaking a superlong neck? In 2022, paleontologists found the first evidence of a non-avian dinosaur with a respiratory illness. The scientists made the discovery based on broccoli-shaped growths in the hollows of the dino’s fossilized neck bones similar to those in living birds and reptiles. “Having details like this makes these dinosaurs relatable,” Brusatte says. “It helps us see them as not just petrified bones but as actual animals that lived.”These giant reptiles were snugglers. Around 70 million years ago, three young oviraptorosaurs died close by, leaving their fossilized skeletons huddling together. Paleontologists suggest that might be the first example of dinosaurs roosting together—like modern crows and bats—for protection or warmth. And one 2020 report theorizes that this dinosaur brooded its own eggs. “They were taking care of their eggs,” says Louise Bodt, a biology and paleontology educator at the American Museum of Natural History. “That really brings them to life for me.”Some dinos moved like human babies. Humans are the only animals known to transition from walking on all fours to two legs—except dinosaurs. According to a 2019 paper, a one-pound hatchling dinosaur called Mussaurus patagonicus likely walked on all fours. As it grew—eventually weighing over a ton—its tail became heavy enough to allow the animal to balance on two legs.When T. rex roamed, Stegosaurus was already a fossil. “Some people have this misconception that all dinosaurs lived together at the same time in a prehistoric tropical paradise,” Brusatte says. But for about 180 million years, dinosaur species emerged and went extinct at different times. “When T. Rex was living, every Brontosaurus and Stegosaurus that ever lived were already fossils underneath its feet,” Brusatte says.We haven’t found all the dinosaurs. “Somebody is finding a new dinosaur species on average once a week,” Brusette says. “And we’re finding more right now than we ever have before.” (Kids can check out the latest dino news here.) As new dino species emerge, scientists are also debating things we assume about fossils in museums. Like, is the most famous T. rex fossil, Sue, not really a T. rex after all? “That’s what’s so cool about science,” Bodt says. “It’s what we know up until now, but it’s always changing as we get new evidence.”",
"An artist's impression of a group of Yutyrannus and two smaller Beipiaosaurus.A newly discovered giant feathered dinosaur—a distant cousin of Tyrannosaurus rex—sported a fine down coat, making it the largest feathered animal known to have lived, scientists say.Paleontologists already knew that some members of the group of dinosaurs to which T. rex belonged, called theropods, were feathered. But most of the known feathered dinos were relatively small."It was a question mark whether larger relatives of these small theropods were also feathered," said study team member Corwin Sullivan, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. "We simply didn't have data either way, because soft-tissue preservation of any kind is so rare."Now three tyrannosauroid fossils—one adult and two juveniles—offer clear proof that giant theropods could also be feathered. Their feathers were simple filaments, more like the fuzzy down of a modern baby chick than the stiff plumes of an adult bird.The new dinosaur species, detailed in this week's issue of the journal Nature, has been named Yutyrannus huali—a Latin-Mandarin mash-up that means "beautiful feathered tyrant."(Related pictures: "'Incredible' Dinosaur Feathers Found in Amber.")Bus-Size "Chick"The three 125-million-year-old specimens were collected from a single quarry in Cretaceous-era rocks in northeastern China's Liaoning Province. The region is where other famed feathered dinosaurs, such as the flashy Sinosauropteryx (picture), were discovered (prehistoric time line).The researchers estimate that the adult Yutyrannus would have measured about 30 feet (9 meters) long and weighed about 1.5 tons (1,400 kilograms).That makes it only about a fifth to a sixth the weight of its infamous cousin Tyrannosaurus rex—but some 40 times heavier than the largest previously known feathered dinosaur.(Related: "New Dinosaur Discovered: T. Rex Cousin Had Feathers.")The fossilized feathers—which range from about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long—were preserved in patches on different parts of the three fossils, leading the scientists to speculate that Yutyrannus's entire body was probably covered in feathers.The creature's large size and the primitive state of its feathers rule out the possibility of flight, Sullivan said. Instead, the downy covering may have helped keep Yutyrannus warm."These are among the simplest types of feathers that we find in the fossil record ... and they show up in animals of small body size, where insulation would be really important," said paleontologist Tom Holtz of the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study.(Quiz: Test your dinosaur IQ.)What Were Yutyrannus Feathers For?That Yutyrannus might have needed feathers for insulation is somewhat surprising, because large-bodied animals typically retain heat quite easily.Still, Yutyrannus lived during the middle part of the Early Cretaceous, when temperatures worldwide are thought to have been somewhat cooler than when T. rex lived, during the Late Cretaceous."Maybe a tyrannosauroid of comparable size [to Yutyrannus] in the Late Cretaceous wouldn't have needed feathers, whereas this animal did, just because of the climatic conditions," study co-author Sullivan said.The University of Maryland's Holtz pointed out, however, that T. rex and its close relatives living during the Late Cretaceous wouldn't have limited them to warm environments."T. rex covered a huge range ... and there's no reason to think it wasn't in the Arctic Circle," Holtz said. "A lot of these animals had really big ranges north-to-south in North America, so they could easily have benefited from having some sort of plumage for insulation."As a modern example of this, consider tigers, Holtz said. "Tigers live in the forests of Siberia down to the jungles of southeast Asia. It's true that Siberian tigers have thicker fur, but they're still furry down in the south."It's possible that Yutyrannus's "protofeathers" served other functions besides keeping adult animals warm, the scientists say.For example, the dinosaur may have used its feathers to keep its nest eggs warm. Additionally, the feathers may have been used for sexual display or as camouflage."None of these ideas are mutually exclusive," Holtz said.Researchers next might examine tiny pigment-containing structures called melanosomes, which are possibly still preserved in the feathers, to get a sense of what Yutyrannus looked like, Holtz said.This technique has been used recently to successfully determine the color of other feathered dinosaurs. (See "Dinosaur True Colors Revealed for First Time by Feather Study.")"It should be able to work here" as long as the microscopic details are preserved, Holtz said. "Which means we may finally be able to know how at least one tyrannosaur was colored."(Related: "New Feathered Dinosaur Found; Adds to Bird-Dino Theory.")T. Rex Was Also Fiercely Fuzzy?The latest finding increases the likelihood that the "tyrant lizard king," T. rex, was also feathered.Scientists have speculated that T. rex juveniles were feathered, because they would have been small enough to require insulation. But it was thought the feathers might have disappeared as the animal grew older and larger."Well, here we have a large tyrannosaur that is fuzzy over much of its body ... and that greatly increases the chances that even [a dinosaur] that's six times larger may have retained feathers over most of its body," Holtz said.And even covered in chicklike feathers, the giant T. rex would have been "just as fearsome as ever," Holtz added."Underneath the fluff, it's still the same gigantic crushing teeth and powerful jaws and softball-sized eyes staring at you," he said.The downy feathers "might make it a little more amusing, but only until the point right before it tears you to shreds."",
"An artist's depiction of Caihong juji, a species of theropod dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago in what's now northeastern China.A new dinosaur discovered in China had feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. Based on its stunningly preserved remains, scientists say the dinosaur’s head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds.The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor.Given these traits, the ancient animal has been named Caihong juji—Mandarin for “rainbow with the big crest”—the team reports today in the journal Nature Communications.Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards, says study co-author Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In life, the duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound.“I was shocked by its beautifully preserved feathers, even though I had seen many feathered dinosaur fossils previously,” adds Xu.The slab containing Caihong juji. Exceptional conditions allowed the dinosaur's feathers to fossilize along with its bones.Birds—the last living dinosaurs—use feathers today for flight, but feathers also help birds woo potential mates or jockey for social status. Dinosaur fossils suggest that feathers originally evolved for display, only later taking on the traits needed for flight. (Learn more about how feathers evolved.)Like modern and ancient birds, dinosaurs likely had color vision and took advantage of it with striking, feathery displays. In exceptional cases, scientists can reveal dinosaur feathers’ original colors by finding vestiges of pigment sacs called melanosomes within fossilized plumes. (See the full-body coloration of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis.)Yang Jan, a local farmer, found the Caihong fossil in northeastern China’s Hebei Province. In February 2014, the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning acquired the fossil from Jan.When scientists led by Dongyu Hu, a paleontologist at China’s Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil, they found that its well-preserved remnants contained traces of pigment in its feathers. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers.On Caihong’s head, chest, and parts of its tail, the researchers saw melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets. These patterns most closely match the melanosomes in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds.In hummingbirds, similar structures split light like a prism, creating a metallic sheen that changes color with the viewing angle. The team couldn’t reconstruct the dinosaur feathers’ exact colors, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer.Paleontologists have seen this sparkle in dinosaurs before. In 2012, scientists found evidence that the feathered dinosaur Microraptor glinted blue in the sun like modern crows and grackles. Unlike Caihong, though, Microraptor was iridescent all over—and it is much younger: Microraptor lived a full 40 million years after Caihong.“When we put these data on the evolutionary tree, we recognize two different ways of creating iridescent color in small raptor dinosaurs before the origin of birds,” says Julia Clarke, a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin who coauthored the Caihong and Microraptor studies.Caihong may not have used just its feathers for showing off, notes University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who reviewed the study before publication.“Its plumage was a shiny rainbow of iridescent colors … but it didn't stop there,” he says. “It also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which was probably a display structure as well.”The skull of Caihong juji.In addition, Xu says that Caihong’s frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, and their short, stiff leading edges would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. Caihong is now the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation. The iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx also has asymmetrical feathers, but it lived ten million years later.With Caihong, “who knows what the functions of this large, wide tail were?” says National Geographic explorer Ryan Carney, a University of South Florida biologist who studies Archaeopteryx. “Perhaps it was held up as a dark background to provide contrast against the iridescent head during displays?”Clarke, an expert on the origin of birds, says that researchers also can’t yet be sure how Caihong used its iridescent feathers, or whether males or females of the species had different plumage. For that, paleontologists can only hope for further study of the new fossil, and perhaps even more bones from Caihong and other feathered dinosaurs.“The more feathered dinosaurs we find, the more we learn just how birdlike they were,” adds Brusatte. “We have to think of these animals as birds. If we were alive back then, that's [what] we would have considered them.”",
"More than 66 million years ago, a “tyrant lizard king” ruled western North America: the fearsome predatory dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex. But how large was this monarch’s royal family? Could what we call T. rex today be composed of multiple species?In a controversial new study in the journal Evolutionary Biology, three paleontologists argue that the fossils assigned to T. rex cluster into three different body types, which they further contend represent three separate species. In addition to T. rex, the researchers propose two new species names: T. regina and T. imperator, from the Latin for “queen” and “emperor.”“For Tyrannosaurus, all the specimens from North America have been put into the same species, T. rex … and that’s become something of a problem because nobody was testing whether that was really true or not,” says study leader Gregory Paul, a paleoartist and independent researcher who wrote The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs.Paul and his co-authors contend that their findings, if validated, would sharpen our view of dinosaur evolution during the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 145 million to 66 million years ago. “We're interested in the possibility of trying to see very fine level species-to-species evolution,” says study co-author Scott Persons, a paleontologist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina.If the results are valid, they would reclassify some of the best-known Tyrannosaurus fossils on display in museums around the world.However, paleontologists who were not involved in the new research, including some of the world’s leading experts on T. rex, are skeptical of the study’s results. “It’s just shades of gray and shapes in clouds—there’s no validity here at all,” says tyrannosaur expert Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Paul’s team argues that the known fossils of Tyrannosaurus vary more than the bones of other large predatory dinosaurs. The researchers also argue that the fossils fall into three distinct clusters, based in part on the stoutness of their skeletons and the presence of certain chisel-like teeth, traits long noted to vary among Tyrannosaurus skeletons. “I wanted to get [the new species] named partly to force people to face the issue,” Paul says.The challenge is that the variation within Tyrannosaurus fossils could have stemmed from many factors that would not require new species names. Dinosaurs’ proportions could have changed dramatically as they matured. Individual Tyrannosaurus grew slightly differently, just as humans reach a range of heights. It’s also possible that T. rex took on slightly different builds depending on their food availability or the ecosystems in which they lived.The outside experts say that the study didn’t go as far as it could have to vet these scenarios or weigh their combined effects.“Most of us would predict that yeah, there probably should be multiple species of Tyrannosaurus rex … The real question is, does this paper do a really rigorous job of doing that?” says Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. “I would argue that the paper is relatively unconvincing.”Paleontologists have batted around the notion of multiple Tyrannosaurus species for decades. The predator lived for more than a million years across a swath of ancient North America from western Canada to New Mexico. That’s a large area, and a long time—possibly enough for populations to drift apart and form multiple species. (Find out why paleontologists think billions of T. rex may have roamed the Earth.)If anatomical traits in a given creature’s fossils clearly change over time, the creature may warrant multiple species names to distinguish earlier forms from later ones. In the last few decades, paleontologists have gained a better understanding of the way that such “chronospecies” may succeed one another.Perhaps the most famous and well-established chronospecies come from western North America’s Hell Creek Formation, where Tyrannosaurus is found. Older sediments from the formation preserve one species of Triceratops, T. horridus, while younger rocks farther up the formation preserve a different species, T. prorsus. Some researchers have suggested a similar evolution for other Hell Creek dinosaurs.Tyrannosaurus fossils can vary quite a bit from one another, notably in the dimensions of the femur, or upper leg bone. Some skeletons have stockier, more “robust” femurs, while some have narrower, more “gracile” bones. Years ago, paleontologists also noted that some Tyrannosaurus skulls had pairs of chisel-like incisors in the lower jaw, while others did not.The current study is based on a dataset of measurements taken across 37 Tyrannosaurus skeletons, with a focus on the femurs and lower jaw teeth. Paul and his colleagues also plotted where 28 of these specimens were found within the Hell Creek Formation: lower, middle, or upper. The lower and deeper the rock layers, the older the fossils must have been.For comparison, Paul’s team sought out datasets for other large predatory dinosaurs, including several other tyrannosaurs and the older non-tyrannosaur Allosaurus. According to their analysis, Tyrannosaurus showed more variability in its bone measurements than any of the other dinosaurs examined.The team found that the group from the Hell Creek Formation’s lowest, oldest rock layers had robust skeletons and two pairs of chisel-like teeth. However, the fossils from the younger layers broke into two clusters. The dinosaurs in each cluster had a single pair of chisel-like teeth, but one group had a more robust skeleton and one had spindlier, more gracile bones.Paul’s team argues that sex differences between male and female Tyrannosaurus can’t explain this variability through time. They also ruled out individual differences and the animals’ growth stages. The researchers instead say that each cluster could be interpreted as its own species.The classic Tyrannosaurus rex, defined from a skeleton now housed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, fell into the robust and younger group, and it remains T. rex in the proposed naming scheme.Paul’s team named the most ancient group T. imperator and suggested Sue, the famousTyrannosaurus at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, as the defining holotype of the species. The researchers defined T. regina, the gracile contemporary of T. rex, using a skeleton at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.Whether these proposed Tyrannosaurus species hold up hinges on the validity of the data clusters—which outside experts say are not as well supported as they would like.Other recent studies haven’t seen this same clustering, notably a massive analysis of T. rex’s different life stages that Carr published in 2020. As part of his study, Carr measured and analyzed 1,850 individual skeletal traits. He found no evidence that Tyrannosaurus came in distinct male or female forms, let alone clear clusters that would be explained by multiple species. “If these taxa were real, I would have recovered them,” Carr says.Zanno adds that the study did not use the bones’ cross-sections to constrain how old each Tyrannosaurus individual was when it died, which means that the study may not have sufficiently dealt with the many changes that Tyrannosaurus underwent as it matured.For Tom Holtz, a paleontologist at the University of Maryland, another concern is that the study does not precisely reconstruct where each fossil was found within the Hell Creek Formation, which proved crucial in defining chronospecies within Triceratops. Finer-grained location data for each fossil would sharpen the fossils’ relative ages, which would provide a more stringent test of whether Tyrannosaurus consisted of multiple species over time.“It’s damn difficult. Many of these are historic specimens that were collected before people paid as much attention,” Holtz says. But “it doesn’t mean you don’t do it.”Part of the challenge, Paul counters, is that some of this geologic information is now impossible to retrieve. The quarry that bore AMNH 5027—a well-preserved Tyrannosaurus skull now housed at New York’s American Museum of Natural History—was flooded by the Fort Peck Dam when it opened in 1940, for example, making the rock layers very difficult to study.Scientists also raised concerns over some of the skeletons that were included in the new study. In part, the study relies on fossils housed in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, a paleontology business in Hill City, South Dakota, that sells fossils and fossil replicas to museums and collectors.The study also includes “Stan,” a well-preserved Tyrannosaurus skeleton that the company was court-ordered to sell at auction in October 2020. To this day, the fossil’s location and buyer remain unknown. The scientists interviewed by National Geographic expressed concern about the ethics of relying on Stan and other privately held fossils of Tyrannosaurus.Persons says that the study first entered scientific peer review before Stan’s 2020 sale, and he and Paul add that the study’s analyses rely on the largest possible sample sizes, which cannot be achieved without including the privately held fossils. “If we don’t use them the sample size is too small, and we can’t do anything; we’d have to wait decades,” Paul says.Paul also argues that the new paper may throw a wrench into the fossil market, since the new study argues that not all Tyrannosaurus bones can be assigned confidently to the iconic name of T. rex. If Paul’s study is right, Stan is no longer T. rex; it’s T. regina.The new study’s authors know that they are making a contentious argument for how Tyrannosaurus should be studied and described. To Persons, the naming of a species is ultimately a hypothesis—one that later data can either refute or confirm. “All it takes is one or two specimens that break those rules, right? … [Then] it’s back to the taxonomic drawing board,” he says.“It would not surprise me at all—I’m realistic about my statistics—that it does turn out that [the new species definitions] are not right,” Persons adds. “What I am confident about is that there’s got to be more than one species of Tyrannosaurus.”For Zanno, the study marks a first step toward a more comprehensive charting of the tyrant lizard king’s family tree. “No one hypothesis—whether it’s individual variation, whether it’s growth, or whether it’s the sexual status of your individuals—is going to explain all the variation that you see,” she says. “You need to take a multi-dimensional look at the problem.”",
"Fossils thought to belong to juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex suggest that the bone-crushing behemoths were sleek, fleet-footed predators with knife-like teeth in their teenage years.Sixty-six million years ago, the ground of western North America trembled with the footfalls of a tyrant: Tyrannosaurus rex. But despite a wealth of T. rex remains pulled from the region’s Cretaceous-period rocks, scientists have had few clues about how the celebrity dinosaur grew from a hatchling to a gargantuan predator—until now.In a study published in Science Advances on Wednesday, researchers reveal a stunningly detailed analysis on cross-sections of bone from juvenile tyrannosaurs. The results suggest that T. rex’s growth rates varied as it aged, and that these predatory dinosaurs could seemingly slow their growth when food was scarce, potentially giving them an evolutionary leg up. (Also find out about “Scotty,” the biggest T. rex discovered to date.)The research also casts further doubt on the existence of Nanotyrannus, a controversial “pygmy” tyrannosaur proposed to have lived alongside T. rex. In the 1980s, paleontologists examining a set of small, slender carnivores concluded that the Cretaceous fossils belonged to their own distinct tyrannosaur species. However, subsequent studies have led most experts to agree that the fossils assigned to Nanotyrannus are probably juvenile T. rex.The new study offers the first hard data on the small-scale structure of some purported Nanotyrannus bones, confirming that two candidate fossils are in fact juveniles. So, either an adult Nanotyrannus hasn’t been found yet—or Nanotyrannus really is a teenage T. rex. In the latter case, the fossils offer a rare glimpse at an important developmental stage in the life of this dinosaur icon.“There’s still a lot to learn about dinosaurs, even a dinosaur as famous as Tyrannosaurus rex,” says lead study author Holly Woodward, a paleontologist at the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. “We still know very little about its life history: how it grew up from hatching out of an egg to a 9,000-kilogram beast.”Previous studies of adult T. rex showed that the dinosaur grew to a massive size by the time it reached its mid-20s. In two influential 2004 papers, researchers suggested that it went through a growth spurt in its teenage years, putting on an average of five pounds a day. But analyzing elderly T. rex can’t provide the whole story. As bones grow, they constantly remake themselves, which gradually erases the bone laid down in childhood.“We know that [T. rex] had to grow fast to go from a hatching probably no bigger than a pigeon into an adult larger than a bus, but we don't know a lot about how it grew during its teenage years,” Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who reviewed the study, says in an email.Enter Woodward, whose childhood fascination with microscopy led her to study the tiny structures preserved in dinosaur bones. For this study, Woodward and her team focused on two dinosaur specimens found in Montana and housed at Illinois’s Burpee Museum of Natural History. One, named Jane, is a nearly complete tyrannosaur fossil that’s about 21 feet long. The other, which is unnamed, is less complete but was probably bigger than Jane.The team first removed thin slices from the two individuals’ leg bones and embedded the slices in plastic resin. They then took even thinner slices and ground them down to the thickness of a human hair—thin enough for light to pass through the fossilized bone. Woodward examined these translucent slivers up close to look for hidden detail. Preserved vessel canals reveal how much blood nourished the bone, a proxy for the bone’s growth rate. The bone’s structural organization also held clues: The less organized its minerals appeared, the faster the bone was laid down.Like tree rings, bones also preserve annual changes. When times are good in warmer months, the animals tended to grow faster. In lean times over winter, growth stalled anywhere from three to six months, leaving telltale rings behind.Both individuals’ bone fibers were disorganized and rife with blood vessels, which suggests that the bone was growing rapidly when the animals died. What’s more, the bones didn’t have the stacks of lines characteristic of adult bones, confirming that the two fossils belonged to juveniles. For the team, this only adds to the evidence that the remains are most likely T. rex. (Here’s how tiny T. rex ancestors are also revealing more about the famous dinosaur’s growth.)“This study is another nail in the coffin of Nanotyrannus. I think it's about time to put that coffin into the ground,” Brusatte says. “Although I hold out hope that an adult Nanotyrannus might be found, at this point I'd say it's about as equally likely as finding an actual fossil unicorn in the same rocks.”Based on the number of growth rings, Woodward’s team estimates that the two individuals were at least 13 and 15 years old when they died. In addition, the team found that each individual’s growth rate swung considerably year to year, probably as available food rose and fell.“It suggests that, rather than starving and dying one year because you don’t have the resource abundance, you just don’t grow,” Woodward says. In the same rocks that preserve T. rex fossils, paleontologists don’t find many other mid- to large-size carnivores, suggesting that other predators may not have been as well equipped to survive in this ecosystem, she adds. “Maybe this strategy is something that really worked well for [T. rex].”This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.Looking ahead, Woodward is adding data to an even bigger study of tyrannosaur growth, to nail down whether it’s possible to model the dinosaurs’ growth patterns based on the fragmentary fossil record. She’s also keen to do more analysis on these particular tyrannosaur remains from the Burpee Museum.For instance, their work hints that one of the two specimens might have preserved medullary bone, a type of bone that only ovulating females would possess. Confirming this discovery will require follow-up chemical work.“I think it’s great that there’s still so much to learn,” she says. “I remember growing up, reading all these books on dinosaurs and thinking, Man, I really want to study dinosaurs, but by the time I’m old enough, there’s nothing left to study. I’m so glad I’m wrong about that.”",
"Discovered in 1991, the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen known as Scotty weighed an estimated 19,500 pounds in life—making it the biggest T. rex ever found.A fossil site in Canada has yielded the heaviest Tyrannosaurus rex specimen ever found—an animal that weighed an estimated 19,500 pounds in life, far heftier than most elephants alive today.The dinosaur, unveiled last week in The Anatomical Record, consists of a skeleton that's about 65 percent complete, including the skull and hips along with some of its ribs, leg bones, and tail bones. Nicknamed “Scotty,” the tyrannosaur was a senior by this species' standards, making it to at least the age of 28.Some 68 million years ago, the Canadian landscape Scotty knew was a subtropical coastal paradise—but life was no vacation. The dinosaur's remains include a broken and healed rib, a massive growth of bone in between two teeth—a sign of infection—and broken tailbones possibly maimed by another tyrannosaur's bite.“It was not an easy life, even for the king of predatory dinosaurs, judging by all these injuries,” says Nizar Ibrahim, a paleontologist at the University of Detroit Mercy who wasn't involved with the study.The find suggests that large predatory dinosaurs probably got older and bigger than paleontologists would have surmised based on currently available fossils. Among the known species, T. rex is one of the best represented extinct dinosaurs, with more than 20 fossil individuals identified.“As more specimens of those other theropods are found, we're going to find their Scottys: their particularly large, particularly old individuals,” says study leader Scott Persons, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta. “It would not surprise me that those animals turn out to increase the range of body size—potentially to overlap or even surpass what we know from T. rex.”Scotty has actually been known to paleontologists since 1991, when its bones were dug up at a site in Saskatchewan, Canada. To celebrate this T. rex's discovery, the field crew wanted to raise a toast to the creature. By that point in the field season, all they had on hand to celebrate the occasion was a bottle of scotch—hence the nickname.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.It has taken more than two decades, however, for scientists to come to full grips with Scotty's remains. The animal's massive bones were firmly stuck in very hard rock, making them extremely difficult to extract for study. But once Scotty's bones were freed, Persons's team could finally reconstruct the dinosaur's age and size.Cross-sections of its bones show that their structure is remarkably robust, resembling that of a different T. rex known to have died around the age of 28. And its main leg bone, or femur, in particular provided a vital clue to Scotty's size.By studying many living animals, scientists have found that the wider an animal's femur, the more weight that the bone tends to hold up. Scotty's femur was a whopping eight inches across—which means that Scotty's two legs could hold up more than 19,500 pounds, give or take a couple tons. When the same methods are applied to Sue, the famously complete T. rex at the Field Museum, that fossil comes out about 900 pounds lighter.However, this bone-measuring method isn't foolproof. For one, animals don't use their skeletons to passively hold up their weight; bones also endure the forces of motion. There's some evidence that tyrannosaurs may have been faster and more agile than other groups of large predatory dinosaurs, such as the earlier allosaurs. Perhaps tyrannosaur leg bones were slightly over-engineered to take the stress of running, which would lead researchers to overshoot Scotty's actual weight.In addition, body mass is just one way of parsing bigness, and not all predatory dinosaurs had the same dimensions. Tyrannosaurs such as T. rex appear to have had stockier builds, while other species had longer, more slender bodies. This variety, some researchers argue, may even hold within the T. rex species, which includes some more “slender” specimens.No species demonstrates this conundrum better than Spinosaurus, a semiaquatic dinosaur that lived in what's now northern Africa about a hundred million years ago. The animal was about 50 feet long from its snout to the tip of its tail, which would make it longer than T. rex. But when estimating Spinosaurus's weight based only on femur size, it comes out at just 3,600 pounds.Realistically, Spinosaurus almost certainly weighed more. The dinosaur is thought to have spent much of its time in the water, letting it get away with tinier hind limbs. Also, its bones were far denser than those in other predatory species, a trait that helps maintain buoyancy in living semiaquatic dinosaurs, such as penguins. (Learn more about birds, the dinosaurs that didn't die.)“Spinosaurus is sort of breaking the mold,” says Ibrahim, the National Geographic grantee who rediscovered the remains of Spinosaurus. “It’s a highly specialized theropod with a unique ecology and environmental context—it’s more like a river monster.For now, Persons's gaze will remain on land. He's continuing to study Scotty's remains in detail, starting with the tyrannosaur's dramatic eye crests and flaring “horns” on the sides of its skull.“The big thing that everyone is talking about is just how large this particular individual is,” he says, “but my favorite part of the specimen is actually the smaller details—the little bits of weirdness.”",
"On the evening of March 3, 2013, a young paleontologist named Nizar Ibrahim was sitting in a street-front café in Erfoud, Morocco, watching the daylight fade and feeling his hopes fade with it. Along with two colleagues, Ibrahim had come to Erfoud three days earlier to track down a man who could solve a mystery that had obsessed Ibrahim since he was a child. The man Ibrahim was looking for was a fouilleur—a local fossil hunter who sells his wares to shops and dealers. Among the most valued of the finds are dinosaur bones from the Kem Kem beds, a 150-mile-long escarpment harboring deposits dating from the middle of the Cretaceous period, 100 to 94 million years ago. After searching for days among the excavation sites near the village of El Begaa, the three scientists had resorted to wandering the streets of the town in hopes of running into the man. Finally, weary and depressed, they had retired to a café to drink mint tea and commiserate. “Everything I’d dreamed of seemed to be draining away,” Ibrahim remembers.Ibrahim’s dreams were inextricably entangled with those of another paleontologist who had ventured into the desert a century earlier. Between 1910 and 1914 Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach, a Bavarian aristocrat, and his team made several lengthy expeditions into the Egyptian Sahara, at the eastern edge of the ancient riverine system of which the Kem Kem forms the western boundary. Despite illness, desert hardships, and the gathering upheaval of World War I, Stromer found some 45 different taxa of dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and fish. Among his finds were two partial skeletons of a remarkable new dinosaur, a gigantic predator with yard-long jaws bristling with interlocking conical teeth. Its most extraordinary feature, however, was the six-foot sail-like structure that it sported on its back, supported by distinctive struts, or spines. Stromer named the animal Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.Stromer’s discoveries, prominently displayed in the Bavarian State Collection for Paleontology and Geology in central Munich, made him famous. During World War II he tried desperately to have his collection removed from Munich, out of range of Allied bombers. But the museum director, an ardent Nazi who disliked Stromer for his outspoken criticism of the Nazi regime, refused. In April 1944 the museum and nearly all of Stromer’s fossils were destroyed in an Allied air raid. All that was left of Spinosaurus were field notes, drawings, and sepia-toned photographs. Stromer’s name gradually faded from the academic literature.Ibrahim, who grew up in Berlin, first encountered Stromer’s bizarre colossus in a German children’s book on dinosaurs. From that day on, dinosaurs haunted him. He made three-toed theropod tracks at the beach, and his favorite cookies were shaped like Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex. He visited paleontological collections around Germany and built an impressive collection of models and fossil casts.Stromer’s type specimen of Spinosaurus, found in Egypt in 1912, was incinerated during an Allied bombing of Munich in World War II. Paleontologists have used these rare photos to digitally reconstruct the lost bones. Combining them with more recent discoveries produced a skeleton 50 feet long, the largest of all predatory dinosaurs.He encountered Stromer’s work again while studying paleontology at the University of Bristol. “The breadth and the depth of his work was incredible and inspired me to be ambitious in my own research,” Ibrahim says. While most doctoral students explore a tightly circumscribed topic, Ibrahim’s 836-page dissertation at University College Dublin described the entire fossil record of the Kem Kem.Fieldwork for his Ph.D. brought him to Erfoud several times. On a visit in 2008, when Ibrahim was 26, a Bedouin showed him a cardboard box containing four blocks of distinctive purplish stone streaked with yellow sediment. Protruding from the rock were what looked like a dinosaur hand bone and a flat blade of bone with an unusual milk-white cross section. Like all fossils heedlessly torn from their surrounding geology, the bones’ scientific value was dubious. Ibrahim offered to buy them anyway, thinking they might be of some use for the University of Casablanca’s fledgling paleontology collection.Ibrahim would come to understand their potentially enormous significance during a visit the next year to the Natural History Museum in Milan, Italy. Researchers Cristiano Dal Sasso and Simone Maganuco showed him a partial skeleton of a large dinosaur they had recently received from a fossil dealer. The specimen was laid out on tables in the basement: leg bones, ribs, numerous vertebrae, and several tall, distinctive dorsal spines. Ibrahim was astounded. It was clearly a Spinosaurus,substantially more complete than Ernst Stromer’s lost specimens. Dal Sasso and Maganuco told him that the dealer thought it had been excavated at a site called Aferdou N’Chaft, near El Begaa. The bones were still encrusted with the rock they’d been buried in, a purplish sandstone with yellow streaks. Lifting a chunk of spine, Ibrahim saw a familiar white cross section.“I realized the bones I’d bought in Erfoud must be Spinosaurus—that odd flat bone was a piece of spine,” Ibrahim remembers. It then occurred to him that the scrappy fossils from Erfoud and the magnificent specimen in Milan might belong to the same individual. If so, and if he could pinpoint the exact spot where the fossils had been buried, they could become a Rosetta Stone for understanding Spinosaurus and its world.To find the spot, however, he would first have to do something tougher than finding a needle in a haystack: find a Bedouin in the desert.“I didn’t know his name, and all I could remember was that he had a mustache and was wearing white,” Ibrahim says. “Which in Morocco didn’t narrow things down much.”Four years would pass before Ibrahim could return to Erfoud and attempt to track down his man. Along with Samir Zouhri from the Université Hassan II, Casablanca, and David Martill from the University of Portsmouth in the U.K., Ibrahim visited several excavation sites, starting with Aferdou N’Chaft. Nobody seemed to recognize Ibrahim’s photos of the Spinosaurus fossils or to know the Bedouin from Ibrahim’s vague description. After searching the streets of Erfoud on their last day, they had finally given up and slumped down in a café.As they sat staring blankly at the people passing on the street, a man with a mustache wearing white walked by. Ibrahim and Zouhri exchanged glances, then hopped up and gave chase. It was the same man. He confirmed that he’d chipped the bones out of a rock face over two months of hard work, first uncovering the bones he had sold to Ibrahim, then finding more farther into the hillside, which he had eventually sold to a fossil dealer in Italy for $14,000. When they asked if he would show them the findspot, however, the man at first refused. Ibrahim, who speaks Arabic, explained how essential it was to know where the bones had been found and why that knowledge would someday allow the dinosaur to return to Morocco, as part of a new museum collection in Casablanca. The Bedouin, who had listened in silence, nodded.“I will show you,” he said.After driving their battered Land Rover through the palm plantation north of Erfoud, the man led them on foot along a dry wadi and up a steep bluff. Strata in the surrounding cliffs showed that great meandering rivers had flowed there a hundred million years ago.Finally they reached a gaping hole in a hillside, which had once been a riverbank.“There,” said the Bedouin.Ibrahim climbed in, noting the walls of purplish sandstone with yellow streaks.For Ernst Stromer, Spinosaurus was a lifelong enigma. He struggled for decades to understand the strange creature from the pieces of two skeletons that his team had found. He first speculated that its long neural spines might have supported a shoulder hump like a bison’s, then later surmised that they were part of a dorsal sail, like those sported by some modern lizards and chameleons. He noted that Spinosaurus’s narrow jaws were unique among predatory dinosaurs. So were its teeth—most carnivorous theropods had bladelike, serrated teeth, but these were smooth and conical and resembled those of a crocodile. Stromer concluded, with evident perplexity and perhaps a bit of frustration, that the animal was “highly specialized,” without saying what it was specialized for.Spinosaurus was part of a larger mystery, sometimes called Stromer’s Riddle, that he’d first observed in North African fossils. In nearly all ancient and modern ecosystems, plant-eaters greatly outnumber meat-eaters. Yet along the northern edge of the African continent, from Stromer’s Egyptian excavations in the east to the Kem Kem beds of Morocco in the west, the fossil record suggests the opposite. Indeed, this region was inhabited by three enormous meat-eaters, each of which would have been an apex predator elsewhere: swift, 40-foot-long Bahariasaurus;40-foot Carcharodontosaurus, like an African T. rex; and Spinosaurus, perhaps biggest and certainly oddest of all. Stromer speculated that large herbivores had probably been present—what else had the carnivores eaten?—but not many of their bones had turned up yet. Other scientists have suggested the paradox is merely sampling error, caused by geological processes that mix fossils of different ages together—or by fossil hunters who preferentially select large, spectacular carnivores because they sell better.With a new Spinosaurus in hand and knowledge of the precise location where it had been found, Nizar Ibrahim was in a position to find a more satisfying answer to Stromer’s Riddle. At first glance, however, the new bones made the animal all the more puzzling. For starters, the surface of the dorsal spines was smooth, which meant they were unlikely to have supported a lot of soft tissue like a hump. The spines had few channels for blood vessels, so it seemed unlikely that they were used to regulate body temperature, as other researchers had conjectured. The ribs were equally dense and tightly curved, creating an unusual barrel-shaped torso. The neck was long, the skull enormous. But the jaws were surprisingly slender and elongated, with a peculiar arched snout tip speckled with tiny pits. The forelimbs and thoracic girdle were bulky, while the hind limbs were disproportionately short and slender.“Spinosaurus is incredibly front heavy,” says paleontologist Paul Sereno, Ibrahim’s postdoctoral adviser at the University of Chicago and the discoverer of several notable North African dinosaurs, including Suchomimus, a relative of Spinosauruswith long, crocodile-like jaws. “It’s like a cross between an alligator and a sloth.”Ibrahim had a life-size image of the animal’s skull on the wall in his office that he often stared at, unfocusing his eyes and struggling to imagine the enormous body stretching out behind. “I tried to see all the bones, the muscles, the connective tissue, everything. Sometimes it was there for an instant, then it vanished, like a mirage. My brain couldn’t quite compute all that complexity.”But a computer might. Together with Simone Maganuco at the Milan museum and Tyler Keillor, a fossil preparator and paleoartist at the University of Chicago, Ibrahim set about digitally reconstructing the dinosaur. They CT-scanned each bone of their specimen at the University of Chicago Medical Center and Maggiore Hospital in Milan, then added other body parts by scanning photos from museum specimens in Milan, Paris, and elsewhere, as well as digital images of Stromer’s photographs and sketches, scaling up the remains of younger individuals to adult size in some cases. Keillor, an expert in the digital modeling program ZBrush, sculpted missing bones in ZBrush’s “digital clay,” mapping his work with scans of the same anatomy in related spinosaurid dinosaurs like Suchomimus and Baryonyx. By painstakingly shaping and spacing the 83 vertebrae in their model, they determined that an adult Spinosaurus measured 50 feet from nose to tail. There had been claims that Spinosaurus was the largest carnivore to ever walk the Earth. This confirmed it. (The largest T. rex is 40.5 feet head to tail.)Next they wrapped the skeleton in digital skin to create a dynamic model, which allowed them to estimate the animal’s center of gravity and body mass, the better to understand how it moved. Their analysis led to a remarkable conclusion: Unlike all other predatory dinosaurs, which walked on their hind legs, Spinosaurus may have been a functional quadruped, also enlisting its heavily clawed forelimbs to walk.The peculiarities of the creature began to make real sense, however, only when Ibrahim and his colleagues viewed Spinosaurus from an entirely different perspective: as a dinosaur that spent most of its time in the water. The nostrils are set high on the skull toward the eyes, allowing the animal to breathe with much of its head submerged. The barrel-shaped torso recalls dolphins and whales, and the density of its ribs and long bones is similar to that of another aquatic mammal, the sea cow. The hind legs, so oddly proportioned for walking, would have been perfect for paddling, particularly if the flat claws in its broad hind feet had been connected with webbing like a duck’s, as the researchers suspect. Its long, slender jaws and smooth, conical, croc-like teeth would have been devastatingly effective at snaring fish, and the pits in its snout, also present in crocs and alligators, probably housed pressure sensors to detect prey in murky water. Ibrahim imagines Spinosaurushunting a bit like a heron, leaning forward and snapping up fish with its long muzzle.This new vision of Spinosaurus as an aquatic dinosaur suggests a possible solution to Stromer’s Riddle. The river along which this animal died was one of many large waterways in a vast fluvial system that occupied much of North Africa in the Cretaceous. If the carnivores here were big, so too was the aquatic life, whose remains are common in the Kem Kem deposits: 8-foot lungfish, 13-foot coelacanths, 25-foot sawfish, and similarly outsize turtles. These animals would have made healthy meals for even the largest predator, obviating the need for abundant large herbivores to balance the food web.All this came home to Ibrahim with full force when he saw the culminating phase of the digital dinosaur project: a life-size Spinosaurus skeleton in high-density polystyrene foam, created from the computer model in part by a 3-D printer. The skeleton is mounted in a swimming posture, which Ibrahim thinks it may have employed as much as 80 percent of the time. “I wish Ernst Stromer could see this model, which shows just how much of a specialized swimmer Spinosaurus had become. It would have made him smile.”",
"Tyrannosaurus rex might have been the “tyrant lizard king,” but before the mighty T. rex stomped across what is now North America, it ancestors weren't exactly living like royalty: They were tiny, gangly, and quick on their feet, adapted to life in the shadows of far larger carnivores.Now, a fossil found in Utah is helping paleontologists better understand how this region's tyrannosaurs went from ecological paupers to princes. Weighing about 170 pounds and standing less than five feet tall, the newly named species Moros intrepidus is one of the smallest dinosaurs of its kind dating back to the Cretaceous period, the time between 66 million and 145 million years ago.At 96 million years old, Moros is also the oldest Cretaceous tyrannosaur skeleton found in this region, pushing back that particular record by 15 million years. (Get the best look yet at the face of a tyrannosaur.)This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.“What Moros does for us is help us understand the who, what, why, where, and when of how tyrannosaurs ascended to top predator roles on the North American continent,” says paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, whose team reports the fossil find today in the journal Communications Biology.Small wonder, then, that this dinosaur has the genus name Moros: the Greek embodiment of impending doom.At the dawn of the Cretaceous, tyrannosaurs were nowhere near the titans we imagine today. Instead, they were small, scrappy predators that hunted alongside much larger meat-eating dinosaurs called allosaurs. By 80 million years ago, North America's allosaurs had faded, and tyrannosaurs had grown about 10 times larger—filling in the allosaurs' apex niche in spectacular fashion.It remains a mystery, though, how North America's tyrannosaurs got big, since there's a major gap in the continent's mid-Cretaceous fossil record. With the exception of some isolated teeth, paleontologists had been missing skeletal evidence of North American tyrannosaurs from about 150 million years ago to 80 million years ago.As a result, researchers including Zanno kept searching mid-Cretaceous rock formations. In 2013, Zanno struck gold: While walking through her field site in central Utah's Cedar Mountain Formation, she unexpectedly saw limb bones jutting out of a hillside.“We've been hunting in this area for 10 years, and these are the only bones of this animal we've ever recovered,” she says. “It takes teams a very, very long time and and an awful lot of luck.”The foot bones of Moros are so skinny, it looks ganglier than even the juveniles of later, larger tyrannosaur species. But Moros was no toddler: Close study of the bones' cross sections show that the dinosaur was at least six or seven years old when it died, making it close to adulthood.The tiny fossil suggests that North America's tyrannosaurs stayed small until at least the time of Moros, which means that tyrannosaurs grew to movie-monster size in just 16 million years—an evolutionary sprint. Perhaps fittingly, the Moros hind limb has some of the running-adapted features seen in later, bigger tyrannosaurs. (Could you have outrun a T. rex? Here's the science.)“Moros is important in that way; it's the first hint of tyrannosaurs that eventually became the big ones,” says Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College and a tyrannosaur expert who wasn't involved with the study.What's more, Moros most closely resembles tyrannosaurs that lived in Asia in the early Cretaceous. The find suggests that the ancestors of Moros crossed a land bridge from Asia into North America, as part of an exchange between the two continents that's well-documented in other dinosaur groups. To honor its journey, researchers gave Moros the globe-trotting species name of intrepidus.Now that her team has unveiled Moros, Zanno is eager to describe its swampy home. The same rocks that once held Moros also have yielded the massive allosaur Siats and several plant-eating dinosaurs, including some that are thought to have burrowed. She is also working with researchers to study the area's fossil plant life.“Hopefully,” she says, “we'll have a whole string of discoveries that are going to reveal this lost Cretaceous ecosystem.”",
"Tyrannosaurus rex is the ultimate in Mesozoic clickbait. You could even say that it’s a real tyrant, casting a large shadow over the hundreds of other dinosaurs that could benefit from some time in the spotlight. So even though paleontologist Stephan Lautenschlager included T. rex in his new study on dinosaur bites, I don’t want to talk about the tyrant lizard king much. I want to focus on a different lizard.Long time readers know that I have a soft spot for Allosaurus. The 150 million year old dinosaur was the top carnivore of the Late Jurassic, reaching sizes to rival that of the later T. rex and was much more common than its toothy neighbors Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus. And as estimated by Lautenschlager, Allosaurus also had one of the most impressive bites of all time.Working from virtual models of Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, and the herbivorous theropod Erlikosaurus fitted with digital jaw muscles based on the anatomy of buzzards and alligators, Lautenschlager estimated the optimal and maximum gapes for the three dinosaurs. Contrary to what you might expect from the hordes of cgi dinosaurs that stomp across basic cable science channels, these dinosaurs were able to deliver their best bites when their jaws were open about 28 degrees, not flung to their maximum extent.   (Erlikosaurus, which was more on the vegetarian side of the spectrum, had an optimal gape of about 20.5 degrees.)When it came to just how wide the dinosaurs could drop their jaws without tearing up their own jaw muscles, though, Lautenschlager found that Allosaurus significantly surpassed ol’ T. rex. While Tyrannosaurus could open its mouth an impressive 63.5 degrees, the maximum Allosaurus gape came out to 79 degrees.The figures of Lautenschlager’s yawning dinosaurs reminded me of an idea Bob Bakker mooted in the late 90’s. Allosaurus, in Bakker’s view, was the dinosaurian equivalent of a saber-toothed cat, using a wide gape and strong neck muscles to slash at prey rather than deliver a devastating chomp like T. rex. While the paper was more qualitative and speculative than Lautenschlager’s work, Bakker was nonetheless right that Allosaurus was capable of an astonishingly wide gape.But why? That’s a little more difficult to suss out, especially since it’s easy to be misled by our love of extreme dinosaur traits and habits.First off, most of the recent work on Allosaurus feeding has focused on a particular specimen and species. That’s MOR 693 – “Big Al” to you and me – and while it’s often called Allosaurus fragilis in papers, the dinosaur is actually an older, more slender-skulled species whose true name has yet to be officially published. This is important because, as Mark Loewen showed in his dissertation on the carnivore, the skull of true Allosaurus fragilis flared out more towards the back, giving them more space for powerful jaw muscles. How this would have affected bite performance hasn’t been given the same attention Big Al has enjoyed.It’s also worth noting that Allosaurus might have had two killing techniques. Maximum gape and optimal gape, as Lautenschlager found, are not the same. Exceptionally wide bites would have actually been weaker than when the dinosaur held its jaws at optimal tension. In short, Allosaurus would have delivered its best bites with a smaller gape. (And the same would have been true for Tyrannosaurus, which could throw open its jaws impressively wide, too.) Why the dinosaurs was able to really open wide, then, might support something Bakker previously suggested. If Allosaurus really did attack with a wide gape, the dinosaur could have used its strong neck muscles to drive its toothy upper jaw at prey like some kind of biological “war club.” More of a slash than a bite.So why was Allosaurus capable such an unusual bite? Could it be true that Allosaurus had such wide gapes because they were going after larger prey? That was Bakker’s contention. The big gape made Allosaurus a specialized “brontosaur killer” capable of taking down the surplus of giant sauropods that plodded around the floodplains of the Jurassic west. As dramatic as such visions are, though, there are a few problems with envisioning Allosaurus jumping onto the back of an adult Diplodocus and slicing massive chunks out of flesh.Even if Allosaurus really did slice at sauropod hides in the way Bakker and others have suggested, though, taking down a full-grown sauropod would have been no simple task. Sauropod necks, for example, were not noodles just begging to be bitten through, but, as Mike Taylor and colleagues recently pointed out, were “constructed from tough elements including the often robust cervical ribs, bony laminae, ligaments, and tendons.” Decapitation is never as easy as the movies make it look.And while “Clash of the Titans” dominates paleoimagery, such confrontations were probably rare. Like many modern carnivores, Dave Hone and Oliver Rauhut wrote, carnivorous dinosaurs likely targeted hatchlings and juveniles. (And this might explain why finding baby dinosaurs is so difficult!)Not to mention that Bakker’s chosen analogues for Allosaurus – the sabercats – didn’t target the biggest prey on the landscape. Geochemical signatures in bones pulled from the La Brea asphalt seeps indicate Smilodon targeted bison and camels, not giant sloths or mammoths, and, in a recent review of Ice Age ecosystems, Blaire Van Valkenburgh and colleagues found that large herbivores are vulnerable to carnivores when they’re juveniles. A Homotherium den in Texas littered with the bones of young mastodons attests to the fact that these sabercats typically targeted juvenile giants rather than risking injury and death under the feet of the adults. The same was probably true for Allosaurus, especially since sauropod dinosaurs laid multiple eggs at a time and the landscape may have been flooded with naive young dinosaurs when hatching season rolled around.So we’re left with the perpetual paleontological problem of what an animal could have done and what it actually did. Perhaps Allosaurus both bit at its prey and swung its skull like a tooth-studded hatchet, making it a more versatile predator and perhaps explaining why it’s apparently so much more common in Morrison Formation rocks than any of its competitors. And that makes me feel sorry for the baby sauropods that walked into the fern-covered floodplains and conifer stands of the Late Jurassic world. Imagine hearing the snap of a twig, turning at the sound to see the sky blocked out by a set of serrated teeth swinging down on you from above.References:Bakker, R. 1998.

"If you traveled back in time 67 million years ago to ancient Montana, you’d be entering the realm of a tyrant: the iconic predator Tyrannosaurus rex. Before you venture into that lost world, though, you might want to know: On average, how close is the nearest T. rex to you?That might sound like an impossible thing to know—but after crunching through two decades’ worth of T. rex research, a new study provides estimates of the animal’s population density. In all likelihood, a T. rex would be within 15 miles of you, if not much closer.The new study, published last Thursday in Science, also translates these population densities into estimates for how many T. rex ever lived. On average, researchers estimate that some 20,000 T. rex lived at any one time and that about 127,000 generations of the dinosaurs lived and died. Those averages imply that a total of 2.5 billion T. rex lived in the species’ native North America, possibly as far north as Alaska and as far south as Mexico, over a two- to three-million-year timespan.This research isn’t the first time that scientists have tried to estimate T. rex numbers. In fact, the average population density in the new paper—roughly one T. rex every 42 square miles—closely resembles an earlier estimate published in 1993. But the new study uses the latest T. rex biology research to try to set highly accurate upper and lower limits on the total population.After running millions of computer simulations, each one with a slightly different mix of the possible values, the study found that the total T. rex count could be as low as 140 million and as high as 42 billion, with the average hovering around 2.5 billion. Likewise, anywhere from 1,300 to 328,000 T. rex could have been alive at any one time, with 20,000 being the average.“It’s really exciting that someone’s trying to … use everything we know about T. rex to try and figure out population dynamics,” says Holly Woodward, a paleontologist at the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences who wasn’t involved with the new study. “It’s interesting and fun that this hasn’t been done on this sort of scale.” (Learn more about Woodward’s research on how T. rex spent its teenage years.)In the last 20 years, researchers have discovered an extraordinary amount about T. rex, including how long it lived (roughly 28 years), when it reached sexual maturity (roughly 15.5 years old), and how much it weighed when fully grown (roughly 15,000 pounds, on average). These data let scientists calculate T. rex’s approximate generation time—19 years, give or take—and the average body mass of T. rex at any given time.To get to T. rex’s population numbers, researchers took advantage of a relationship between body mass and population density among living animals. On average, as body mass increases by a factor of 10, population density thins out by more than four-fifths—a pattern known as Damuth’s Law.Damuth, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, first discovered this pattern by compiling 30 years’ worth of ecological data on living mammals. However, Damuth’s Law isn’t ironclad, since animals vary widely in their specific lifestyles and habitats. For example, spotted hyenas and jaguars have similar body masses, and both are predators, but the hyenas’ population density is some 50 times higher.When applied to T. rex (after correcting for the fact that T. rex isn’t mammalian), Damuth’s Law implied that the dinosaur’s true total likely fell within 140 million and 42 billion individual dinosaurs.“In paleontology, it’s very hard to estimate things … so what I’ve started to do is think less about estimating something and more about bracketing it. Can I put a robust upper and lower bound on it?” says lead study author Charles Marshall, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley.Aside from getting a better sense of how many of these elephant-sized predators were stomping around, Marshall and his team were able to crunch the numbers to better estimate how often fossils form. Could the odds of a T. rex fossilizing be quantified, in the same way that we can calculate the odds of getting struck by lightning?There are a hundred or so known specimens of T. rex, but roughly two-fifths of them are in private or commercial hands and can’t be reliably studied. So to set a minimum fossil total for the study’s purposes, Marshall’s team limited its count to 32 fossils of post-juvenile T. rex that are held in public institutions.If all the T. rex that ever lived—the estimated 2.5 billion—yielded just those 32 fossils, then only about one in 80 million T. rex fossilized after they died. Even if a higher percentage of the animals fossilized and we have yet to find the remains, the sheer tininess of these odds underscores just how rare it is for a carcass to be buried quickly enough and in the right chemical conditions to mineralize and form a fossil. “If T. rex were a thousand times less abundant—if the total wasn’t 2.5 billion but was 2.5 million—we might never have found it,” Marshall says.The method Marshall’s team has outlined could be used for other extinct creatures, as well. Among dinosaurs, researchers say one of the best candidates is the Cretaceous herbivore Maiasaura, which is known from hundreds of specimens, from newborns to adults.For Woodward, one of the study’s most exciting implications is just how rare dinosaur fossils really are. If these rates hold for species other than T. rex, researchers may even be able to estimate how many dinosaur species simply didn’t fossilize at all—and are now irrevocably lost to time. “Being able to figure out how much we’re missing can be just as important as knowing how much we have,” she says.",
"The Tyrannosaurus rex fossil known as Stan is displayed in a gallery at Christie’s auction house in New York City on September 17, 2020.More than three decades ago in South Dakota, an amateur paleontologist named Stan Sacrison discovered a titan of the ancient Earth: the fossil of a mostly complete, 39-foot-long Tyrannosaurus rex. Nicknamed “Stan” after its discoverer, the beast was excavated in 1992 and has long been housed at the private Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota. But even if you’ve never been there, chances are good that you’ve seen this particular T. rex. Dozens of high-quality casts of its bones are on display in museums around the world, from Tokyo to Albuquerque, New Mexico.Now, an auctioneer’s hammer has thrown Stan’s future into question, with the dinosaur bones sold off to the highest—and, so far, anonymous—bidder, stoking fear among experts that this beloved T. rex may be lost to science.On October 6, the London-based auction house Christie’s sold the T. rex for a record $31.8 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a fossil. The previous record was set in 1997 with the sale of “Sue,” a largely complete T. rex dug up by the same South Dakota institute and eventually purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago for $8.36 million (equivalent to nearly $13.5 million today).The day after Stan was sold, paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences described the sale price as “simply staggering.”“That’s an astronomical price that borders on absurdity, based on my knowledge of the market,” added paleontologist David Evans, the vertebrate paleontology chair at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, who suggested the anonymous buyer could have spent the same funds in a far more effective way to deepen humanity’s understanding of the prehistoric beasts. “If this kind of money [were] invested properly, it could easily fund 15 permanent dinosaur research positions, or about 80 full field expeditions per year, in perpetuity,” he wrote in an email interview.Scientists also have raised concerns about the negative ripple effects the sale could have on the study of dinosaurs by incentivizing people to seek out and sell well-preserved fossils rather than leaving them for paleontologists to study. (Find out more about the U.S. fossil trade in National Geographic magazine.)“This is terrible for science and is a great boost and incentive for commercial outfits to exploit the dinosaur fossils of the American West,” says tyrannosaur expert Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Paleontologists fear that if the buyer turns out to be a private collector, researchers and the public could lose access to the fossil, limiting their ability to repeat results such as measurements of its bones or conduct new analyses with more advanced tools and techniques. (Find out how scientists are reimaging dinosaurs in today’s “golden age” of paleontology.)The ability to repeat experiments is “a tenet of science; it's part of our ethical foundation,” Zanno says. “The paleontological world is holding its breath” to find out Stan’s future.The Black Hills Institute is perhaps best known for its involvement in the collection of—and years-long custody battle over—the T. rex named Sue, which involved an FBI raid and a legal dispute with the Cheyenne River Sioux. While not quite as dramatic, Stan’s sale also stems from a court ruling. (Find out more about Sue, the world’s most famous T. rex, in National Geographic magazine.)For years, the Black Hills Institute had Stan on display in its Hill City museum. In addition to selling resin casts to other museums, the institute gave researchers access to the fossil, resulting in a flurry of scientific papers about everything from T. rex’s immense bite force to how the skull of T. rex could flex and move.“The skeleton of Stan is without doubt one of the very best Tyrannosaurus rex specimens ever found, and it’s been published in the scientific literature many times,” Evans says. “Stan is one of the keystone specimens for understanding T. rex.”Carr, for one, included Stan in three studies of tyrannosaur diversity and skull shape earlier in his career. He now regrets that decision because the fossil was always in private hands and therefore at risk of being sold. “In the end, I wound up contributing to the successful sales pitch of the fossil … along with the other 45 scientific publications on Stan,” he says. “We shouldn't have touched it with a 10-foot pole.”Stan’s path to the auction block began in 2015, when Neal Larson, a 35-percent shareholder in the Black Hills Institute (and brother of the institute’s president, paleontologist Pete Larson), sued the company to liquidate its assets. According to South Dakota’s Rapid City Journal, the company had removed Neal Larson from its board of directors three years earlier, after a bitter dispute over business dealings and his defense of a former employee accused of sexual misconduct.A judge ruled in 2018 that Stan had to be auctioned off to pay Neal Larson for his stake in the institute, according to a company press release. Despite Stan’s sale, the Black Hills Institute retains the rights to make and sell future casts of the T. rex’s bones, including full-size replica skeletons.“We were saddened to learn that the winner of the auction was probably not a museum, but we are hopeful that the new owner will eventually put Stan on display so the public will be able to continue to see and study this awesome original skeleton,” Pete Larson said in an October 7 press release.In 2018, James Hyslop, the head of the science and natural history department at Christie’s, began to shepherd Stan through the auction process. On October 6, Hyslop was on the phone with the anonymous bidder, calling out their winning purchase price from Christie’s London office.In an email to National Geographic, Hyslop declined to comment on the winning bidder’s identity, or even whether the buyer was a private collector or a public research institution. “As is the case with all successful sales, we are pleased to have achieved a strong result,” he wrote. “It has been an honor to have had the opportunity to work with such an extraordinary specimen.”In the U.S., fossil bones found on federal land are public property and can be collected only by researchers with permits. These remains also must stay in the public trust, in approved repositories such as accredited museums.However, fossils discovered on U.S. private land can be bought and sold, and Stan isn’t the only U.S. dinosaur fossil recently on the auction block. In 2018, the French auctioneer Arguttes sold off a skeleton of the predatory dinosaur Allosaurus, drawing criticism from scientists because its sale, like Stan’s, risked creating the perception that dinosaurs were worth more in dollars than they were in discoveries.The 2,000-member Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP), which represents paleontologists around the world, opposes fossil auctions and has long discouraged the study of privately held fossils, out of concern that researchers and the public wouldn’t always be guaranteed access to them. In September, the organization sent a letter to Christie’s asking them to restrict bidders for Stan to public research institutions. In its reply, Christie’s acknowledged the society’s stance but said that the sale couldn’t be restricted, according to University of Bristol paleontologist and outgoing SVP president Emily Rayfield, who co-signed the society’s letter.“The high-profile nature of the auction and the publicity surrounding the auction event were designed to appeal to high-end bidders, thereby elevating the price of fossil material and promoting fossils as luxury items,” Rayfield wrote in an email interview. “How can public trust institutions spend this kind of money on single fossil specimens—money that could fund jobs, field programs, training, exhibits, and much more?”Other countries take stricter stances on the fossil trade. In Alberta, Canada, for instance, fossils found in the province can’t be exported, thanks to a 1970s law that designated fossils part of Alberta’s natural heritage. Similar laws are also on the books in paleo-hotspots such as Brazil, China, and Mongolia. However, Evans says that black markets persist in fossils from these countries, in part because of the allure of huge paydays. (Find out more about the Mongolian fossil black market—and one scientist’s fight against it.)“The sale of Stan will perpetuate more pillaging of protected fossils in a big way,” Evans says. “It’s heartbreaking.”University of Calgary paleontologist Jessica Theodor, SVP’s incoming president, adds that auctions don’t just price out researchers—they can shape the hunt for fossils for years to come. After Sue’s multimillion-dollar sale in 1997, some U.S. researchers were shut out of private land sites they had worked on for decades, Theodor says, in part because landowners wanted to sell their fossils or lease their land’s fossil-digging rights to private companies. Paleontologists also saw a rise in vandalism at fossil sites as robbers tried to steal what they thought were valuable remains.“A big sale like this stands to do much more damage than [the sale of] Sue did,” Theodor said.Commercial fossil diggers in the U.S. have long argued that their business model brings important fossils to light, because the profit motive encourages more people to dig. The most reputable of these firms excavate and prepare fossils to high standards, and they contact researchers when they’ve found fossils of clear scientific significance.At its best, this system can find and protect invaluable fossils, such as the armored dinosaur Zuul crurivastator, which U.S. fossil firm Theropoda found on private Montana ranchland in 2014. Once Theropoda realized what it had, it contacted Canada’s Royal Ontario Museum, which sent researchers to the site and bought the fossil for an undisclosed sum in 2016. (Learn more about Zuul and its remarkable armor in National Geographic magazine.)For all the debate around commercial sales, public auctions are beasts unto themselves. Bidding wars can drive up a fossil’s price to far beyond what any university or museum could afford. As a result, fossils that would otherwise enter the public trust go into private collections instead.Stan appears to be the spoils of such a war. During Tuesday’s auction, two bidders drove Stan’s price up by millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. The meteoric rise almost certainly priced out most public institutions—especially this year, as COVID-19 has financially devastated museums the world over.The paleontologists contacted by National Geographic urged Stan’s new, anonymous owner to donate the T. rex specimen to a museum or research institution.“Do the right thing: totally relinquish your ownership of the fossil and donate it to an accredited natural history museum so that science can ethically be done on Stan for the benefit of everyone on the planet who has an interest in dinosaurs,” Carr urged.“You have the opportunity to share a treasure with the world,” Zanno added. “It's a rare gift—take it.”",
"Working beside a sunscreen at a quarry in Wyoming, Yolanda Siber digs up dinosaur bones for her family's museum in Switzerland. Private collectors, such as Siber, and academics have a rocky relationship, says Yolanda's father, Kirby. "It's a pity. If we worked together, we'd have great results."Fyodor Shidlovskiy and Mike Triebold don't know each other from a hole in the ground, but they share an undying passion for long-dead and buried beasts.Each summer Shidlovskiy mounts a safari of men, buses, trucks, amphibious vehicles, planes, helicopters, and riverboats and ventures onto the tundra of northeastern Siberia. In the extended Arctic daylight, he and his team spend weeks at a stretch recovering the bones and tusks of woolly mammoths, the lumbering precursors of today's elephants that until about 10,000 years ago wandered the bitterly cold steppes alongside our own fur-clad ancestors.The best of his finds he restores (with auto body filler and varnish) and assembles into complete skeletons. Bones and tusks of lesser quality he has carved into chess sets and knick-knacks. The least valuable are ground into powder for use in traditional Chinese cures. Eventually everything is sold, mostly in Hong Kong and the United States.Shidlovskiy (Fyodor to his friends, and everyone quickly becomes a friend of this joyful, effusive Russian) invited photographer Lynn Johnson and me to join him on an expedition. It was to be more than your run-of-the-mill Siberian mammoth quest, he promised: A hunter had tipped him to the whereabouts of an intact baby mammoth skeleton, the rarest of the rare, and he'd love to have us come along to record what promised to be an important find. Hours before dawn on a balmy August morning, we met Fyodor outside his tony, pink-brick apartment building in Moscow and prepared to set out on his latest escapade.Two months earlier and halfway around the globe, Mike Triebold kissed his wife, J. J., goodbye at their custom-built log house in the shadow of Colorado's Pikes Peak, hopped into a convoy of four-wheel drives, and with four of his guys headed north. They were bound for the sleepy cow town of Roundup, Montana, where I would meet them. Triebold, too, was anticipating something extremely rare—a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Walter Stein, Triebold's field manager, had recently discovered a single rib poking out of concrete-hard sandstone on private land Triebold had leased for fossil collecting. The prospect of connecting that bone to the rest of a young T. rex had Triebold wired and dragging heavily on his Kools.For Shidlovskiy and Triebold, hunting down and digging up the extremely dead is life's great joy. Besides the thrill of discovery, old bones provide them with a comfortable livelihood. In fact—with the going price for a nicely turned out T. rex pegged well into the millions, and a fully articulated mammoth selling for a quarter million or more—very comfortable.Shidlovskiy and Triebold are members of a small fraternity of freewheeling men (almost exclusively) who excavate fossils and sell them for profit. I spent months tracking commercial fossil dealers and investigating their trade, not just in Siberia and Colorado, but also in Morocco, northeastern China, Montana, and the Dakotas. I discovered that some dealers are careful collectors and honest businessmen; others are disreputable and brutish, ripping bones from national parks and other protected lands and selling them for a quick buck. Still others, particularly in developing countries such as China and Morocco, are peasants striving to ease their painful lives with whatever they can claw, quite literally, from the earth around them.During my travels I witnessed some of the damage that unscrupulous or untrained dealers do. In northeastern China I watched pick-swinging farmers hack rock slabs containing the remains of ancient birds and fish with little more concern than they gave to plowing their fields. I saw smuggled and fake fossils sold as legitimate in the United States, which strictly prohibits the excavation and export of fossils from government-owned land without a permit, but has no law banning imports—even when they've been smuggled out of their originating country.I also watched commercial dealers excavate fossils with exquisite care, cleaning away the detritus of eons with delicate dental-style tools and keeping finely detailed records of their discoveries. Yet academic paleontologists, more than a dozen of whom I interviewed around the world, tended to tar all dealers with the same brush—as greedy yahoos and enemies of science, a charge I came to see as undeserved.Which is not to say that every dealer runs an aboveboard business. Much of the fossil trade is in cash, and international sales often involve bribes to customs officials and police. The clandestine nature of such transactions makes it impossible to put a dollar total on the worldwide trade, but educated guesses from dealers and scientists suggest that it runs into the tens of millions of dollars each year.The bone market boomed in the late 1980s, when dealers from Japan, flying high on an economic bubble, started buying up some of the biggest and best U.S. fossils and installing them in new museums back home. The Japanese spree drove prices beyond the reach of most American scientists and museums, which couldn't compete at auctions without the help of lavish benefactors or corporate backers. The price run-up hit an all-time high in 1997 when the McDonald's Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, in a show of marketing genius, chipped in to help Chicago's Field Museum buy a Tyrannosaurus rex known as Sue for a staggering 8.36 million dollars and put it on display for the world's kids to see. The sale was a media sensation and alerted landowners across the western U.S. to the market value of the bones buried on their property. Once seen mainly as scientific curiosities, fossils were now potentially lucrative commodities.One result is that rural property owners increasingly are turning their backs on scientists, who depend on free access to fossil sites. (Commercial dealers, by contrast, commonly pay landowners a percentage of their profits. Mike Triebold says he's paid as much as $76,000 to one rancher.) Relationships between scientists and farm families they've visited each summer for decades have dried up in rancor.As with any commodity, price is driven by demand, and in today's booming market, fossils compete with fine art for the attention of the super rich. Just as industrial barons of an earlier time bid for Great Masters, wealthy fossil fanciers such as Bill Gates, Nicholas Cage, and Charlie Sheen, to name a few, compete in New York and California auction houses for the most eye-popping specimens. Such fossils often end up in the oceanfront great rooms of the grandest Pacific coast mansions.Paleontologists lament that once specimens disappear into private collections, they're lost to scientific study. But dealers are quick to point out that most of the world's great museums are full of important fossils donated by collectors. Indeed, many museum collections were purchased from profit-minded men (and the occasional notable woman) who went out to the Wild West of the United States, the barren wastelands of Siberia, the burning deserts of Mongolia, or the mild-mannered forests and coastlines of their own countries, and gathered the bones, teeth, and horns they found there.Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, America's two leading paleontologists in the latter nineteenth century, both paid dealers to find the vast array of fossils they used to wage their furious "bone wars" for primacy in the field. Half a century earlier Mary Anning, a little-educated Englishwoman who grew up in a destitute family beside the coastal cliffs of Lyme Regis, collected spectacular Jurassic fossils that she sold to scientists and noblemen throughout Europe. After she died in 1847, she was lauded as "the greatest fossilist the world ever knew."Today's scientists say less flattering things about fossil dealers. But the opinion of scientists was far from Fyodor Shidlovskiy's mind as he bundled us aboard a chartered bus parked alongside his home. The driver ground the gears into place, and we rolled off on the first leg of an 8,000-mile (12,875-kilometer) haul by road, air, and water. Shidlovskiy's blue eyes, magnified behind wire-rimmed glasses, glittered with excitement.Among us were Shidlovskiy's good friend, the Reverend John Wood, a loquacious, big-game-hunting Baptist preacher from Waco, Texas, and Wood's prominent physician neighbor, "Doctor Joe" Cunningham. They were there mainly for the adventure. (A few months later they would ship crates of medical supplies from Waco to a poorly supplied Siberian clinic we visited.)After a 14-hour bus drive we arrived at Yoshkar Ola's derelict air base, where Fyodor hustled us onto a banged-up Russian border patrol cargo plane. This once worthy warhorse had no seats other than a few benches, no cooling, no heating, and no toilets. Already on board, to our surprise, was a cluster of Siberians living in Moscow who'd heard that Fyodor was going to their hometown and could they hitch a ride? "Fyodor just doesn't know how to say no," Wood drawled admiringly. The good news was that our gracious host had shoved a case of vodka under the pilot's seat. Less encouraging was that the pilot and navigator enthusiastically joined in the toasting as bottle after bottle made the rounds.Eight time zones, nearly ten flying hours, and one case of vodka later, the screaming plane shuddered to a halt on the broken airstrip at Cherskiy, a no-longer-bustling port town on the Kolyma River, in the autonomous Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) high above the Arctic Circle. Bladders bursting, backs aching, we gingerly disembarked and fell into the bear hugs of Sergei Zimov and his wife, Galia. The Zimovs operate a tundra-monitoring scientific station outside the nearly deserted town. Sergei, an ecologist, plays host to scientists and the occasional commercial bone collector, like Fyodor, to help withstand post-perestroika privation.Russian paleontologists are so hard-pressed that some succumb to stealing fossils from their own museums and selling them. In 1999 a complete woolly rhinoceros skeleton, as large as an SUV, was disassembled and removed from the Yakutsk State University Mammoth Museum, where it was on display in a room adjacent to the director's office. Fyodor recovered the fossil and returned it to the museum. This act, he said, won him an official open-ended permit to collect and remove fossils in Sakha and established his self-anointed reputation as "Emperor of Siberia," which he delights in calling himself.After a day of R & R at the Zimovs' camp, we pulled on hip boots (in summer the spongy tundra above the permafrost layer can behave treacherously like quicksand) and clambered onto an orange and blue Mi-8 helicopter Fyodor had chartered. We choppered 200 miles (320 kilometers) north across broken tundra to the Arctic coastline. Our first stop was a rough wooden shack alongside a snaking stream, where two of Fyodor's men and a black-and-white dog named Nelson had spent the past two months. They had collected an array of mammoth bones and tusks, which they loaded into the rear of the helicopter. Next we took off for a spot a few miles beyond, on a towering, eroded coastal cliff.Fyodor and one of his men, Anatoly Borischuk, slithered down the black muck of the cliff face to a narrow ledge, where Borischuk earlier had spotted an adult mammoth skull about the size of a washing machine. A crew member tossed down a rope, which Fyodor threaded through the eye sockets, and all hands helped haul the skull up and into the chopper.Our final stop for the day was the village of Andryushkino. As our helicopter clattered to the ground, a shouting throng flooded out of their concrete-block houses to greet us, smiles creasing their broad Asian faces. The villagers, members of the Yukaghir minority, survive by herding reindeer. Some augment their limited income by gathering fossils for Fyodor, even though taboos warn against disturbing the mammoths. He pays them in cash, snowmobiles, boats, outboard motors, and most recently, laser disco equipment for a new recreation center.A wooden sled hauled by tractor came scraping toward us, heaped with skulls, pelvises, ribs, tibias, and femurs. The bone pile was crowned with a mammoth skull and twin golden tusks tall enough to shelter an NBA star. With this booty stuffed into the helicopter, the human cargo settled onto the bones of our choice for the ride back to Cherskiy.Late the next night we drove down to Cherskiy's dilapidated port. Stumbling over rusting beams and smashed glass, we boarded a government-owned channel-marking ship for a 480-mile (772-kilometer) trip on the Kolyma River. The hunt for the baby mammoth was finally on.As the sun set on our second day out, we anchored near the fossil site and went ashore in powerboats. We trudged clumsily in our hip boots to a shallow mud pit. There lay the large femur and a few other bones that Fyodor's man had discovered. Alas, the tributary stream that had gurgled just feet from the burial site when he made the find, only weeks before we arrived, had dried up. Russian fossil hunters customarily use pressurized water to wash away the earth entombing mammoth bones. Now the only possible water source was a tiny pool a hundred yards distant, which meant that Fyodor would need more hose. A full day was lost as another of his men sped back to Cherskiy in a small boat. When he returned, he was carrying old canvas hoses from the town's fire department and a generator for Fyodor's portable pump.At last the long-awaited excavation began and continued around the clock for the next 48 hours. By late afternoon of the second day, the pool was nearly dry and men strained to augment the flagging flow, scooping out shovelfuls of muck as dense as chewing gum. To everyone's frustration, they uncovered only a few more bones. The youngster either had been killed at another location and part of its remains dragged by predators to this place, or over the millennia bits and pieces had been washed away by rain and melting snow. We left, Fyodor dejected.But not for long. A few hours after setting sail back toward Cherskiy, we dropped anchor at a three-cabin settlement festooned with drying fish like silvery pennants and guarded by ferociously barking sled dogs. The previous summer Fyodor had recruited the hunter-fishermen who live here to gather whatever bones they came across, mammoth or otherwise. Now he had to rouse one of the men, sprawled in a drunken stupor on the pebble-paved riverbank. (Alcoholism is common among the lonely hunters of the tundra.) After a few cups of steaming, sweet tea, a wanly grinning Valeriy Petrov led us to a space beneath one of the log cabins, where he and his friends had stashed tusks and bones.Fyodor estimated the haul at over a thousand pounds and offered the men the equivalent of $16,000, which they snapped up. He handed over a thick stack of rubles and promised to deliver a snowmobile and an outboard motor. The bones were ferried out to our ship, and we resumed the overnight run to Cherskiy. As the boat gathered speed, Fyodor began sorting through the bones, selecting out the mammoth fossils and blithely pitching rejects into the river.About 20 minutes later we were hailed and boarded by four men wearing Environmental Protection Committee patches on their camouflage windbreakers. When confronted with a charge of poaching fossils in Kolyma National Park, Fyodor jauntily assured the officers that their concern was misplaced. Anyway, couldn't they use a new outboard motor? Not only that, but if they would collect bones for him in the future, he'd take good care of them. The erstwhile defenders of the land thanked their new benefactor profusely, pumped his hand, hopped back into their speedboat, and departed.Turning to his bemused American onlookers, Fyodor flung his arms up in mock horror and cocked his head to one side. "Russia!" he said.Mike Triebold's expedition to central Montana was considerably less daunting, at least in getting to where we were going. After a restful night at the Best Value Inn on Main Street in Roundup, I joined Triebold and his crew for a jouncing, hour-long ride in a pickup over prickly rangeland, eventually passing through a barbed-wire gate. As the men unloaded a pneumatic jackhammer and other tools, Triebold walked me over to a raw scar in the brown sandstone. It had been dug from the side of a jagged mound as high as a two-story house. Barely poking out of the rock was what could have been a bone in a standing rib roast, festively wrapped in aluminum foil for protection. Triebold said it belonged to a youthful dinosaur and was "float," meaning it wasn't connected to any other part of the buried skeleton.That lone bone was the latest of a collection Triebold and his crew had recovered since they began digging at the site the previous summer. Triebold, who's been chasing fossils for more than 20 years, had reason to believe that the rest of the skeleton was buried in the mound. That meant that he and the crew would have to remove as much as ten feet (three meters) of overlay before reaching the level where the animal might be. The digging commenced: the roar of a gasoline generator and the staccato outbursts of the big hammer interspersed with long periods of nothing noisier than small chisels scratching at the sandstone. Great black thunderheads boiled above us and wind-whipped sand lashed our eyes. By the time the thunderheads had damped down the dust and temperatures dipped in the late afternoon, Triebold's crew had seemingly made no progress. Shoving back his floppy hat, he decided to call it quits for the day. I was disappointed. He seemed not to be."The ground is the hardest I've ever worked in," he said in a flat, midwestern twang, "but I've got a good feeling about this."Six months later, after Triebold had turned up a good portion of the skeleton, he sent me an e-mail:"Very exciting news: One of the rib fragments has clear [T. rex] serrations across it. ... We believe that this is the first direct evidence of rex-on-rex violence. Now, the big questions are these: Did a pack of Nanos [Nanotyrannus] kill and start eating the juvenile rex, then get chased away by a scavenging adult T. rex, which finished off the carcass? Or did the adult T. rex kill and eat the juvenile in an act of cannibalism, leaving only the scraps for the Nanos after the adult T. rex had its fill? Or did the juvenile rex get killed by the adult rex in a territory battle, and did the carcass then get eaten by the pack of Nanos? We will be looking for more clues as we prepare the specimen."Along with cleaning and stabilizing the skeleton, Triebold carefully mapped the site and preserved all collateral fossils. This level of detailed data by a commercial dealer was a key factor in a decision by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh to buy a first-of-its-kind oviraptorosaur from Triebold and Fred Nuss, the fossil hunter who discovered it. The provenance was excellent, and scientists would have access to the site where the specimens were found. Carnegie is not alone: Other U.S. museums are turning to dealers for fossils.Carnegie's deal with Triebold infuriated some paleontologists. "We wouldn't do it," says Kevin Padian, curator of paleontology at the University of California, Berkeley. A dead-serious scientist with a deceptively pixieish face and a mop of curly gray hair, Padian charges that dealers don't take the necessary pains in establishing fossils' taphonomy—the placement in the ground and the effects of the surrounding soil on the fossilization process. "This work has to be done by experts, and an expert is someone who understands the scientific value, not the dollar value."At the heart of the commerce-versus-science battle is how vast or how limited the Earth's supply of fossils may be. "No one who thinks of conservation can think in terms of a resource being endless," says Padian. Triebold's response: "There's certainly no shortage of invertebrates; they're practically inexhaustible. And vertebrates? Even T. rexes aren't unique anymore. Simply put, fossils are not rare."In a back room tour of the American Museum of Natural History's paleontology collection, department chair Mark Norell walks me through row after row of floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked with fossils seemingly beyond count, many still in their plaster "field jackets." "Most are awaiting preparation and have not yet been studied," Norell acknowledges. "This is common in pretty much every museum in the world."While it's true that many fossils are abundant, others are unique. Or as James Kirkland of the Utah Geological Survey put it to me, "Not all fossils are created equal. Some are worth scientific study, but many are not."One possible solution, Padian says, may lie in dealers and academics exploring together. The scientists could keep the originals for study while the commercial people would produce high quality casts, which most museums and private collectors consider more than adequate. This would give science access to a broadened range of specimens and make material legally collected from government lands available to the private market in the form of casts.Still, having spent many days with the two sets of stubborn protagonists, I suspect it will be a very long time before they seek each other out. Just how long might it take? We may all become fossils first.",
"On a chilly January afternoon, Susannah Maidment stands on the shore of a London lake, staring down a pack of dinosaurs.Maidment, a curator at the U.K.’s Natural History Museum, has come with me to tour Crystal Palace Park, which in 1854 included the world’s first public dinosaur showcase. The sculptures were a smash hit at their unveiling and sparked the dinomania that’s been with us ever since. More than a century before Steven Spielberg dazzled the world with Jurassic Park, the Crystal Palace dinosaurs drew two million visitors a year for three decades straight, and Charles Dickens name-dropped one in his novel Bleak House.To grant us a detailed look at these 166-year-old monuments, Ellinor Michel and Sarah Jayne Slaughter, trustees with the nonprofit Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, guide us through a metal gate to the banks of the lake, where we don waders to make our crossing. I misjudge my first step and fall into the water, clambering onto the island’s shore, dripping wet and smelling of pond scum. “Welcome to Dinosaur Island!” Slaughter exclaims, grinning from ear to ear.Tucked in among ferns and spongy beds of moss, the pale green sculptures are imposing, even imperious. The park’s two Iguanodon, a Cretaceous herbivore, resemble huge iguanas with nubs on their snouts—which scientists now understand were spikes on their thumbs. It’s tempting to dismiss the assemblage as outdated or the stuff of B movies. But Maidment sees the Crystal Palace dinosaurs for what they really are: the bleeding edge of scientific knowledge at the time, based on comparisons between living animals and the few fossils available to researchers.Scientists still use this technique to re-create the fantastic beasts, filling in the soft gaps in time-worn fossils. Bones don’t preserve evidence of cheeks on ancient faces, Maidment says, as we pause between two of the statues, “but we reconstruct them as being there because it works: Animals today have cheeks.” The park’s sculptors used the same process, she says. “They were completely reasonable to reconstruct them like this from what they knew.”In the nearly two centuries since, scientists have learned far more about dinosaurs than the builders of Crystal Palace Park ever could have dreamed. Now our understanding is seeing another revolution—one fueled by a wealth of fresh fossils and innovative research techniques. The resulting scientific bonanza is forcing us to rethink popular visions of these ancient animals.For several years scientists have unveiled an average of about 50 new dinosaur species a year, a pace unthinkable decades ago. The updated menagerie ranges from pint-size fliers with bat wings to long-necked herbivores that were Earth’s biggest ever land animals. Medical scanners, particle accelerators, and chemical analyses are letting researchers virtually separate rock from bone and see fossils’ tiniest hidden features. From the colors of dinosaurs’ eggs and feathers to the shapes of their brains, our dino encyclopedia now includes unprecedented details on how these animals were born, grew up, and lived.With these tools in hand, scientists today are not just overhauling our pop-culture notions about dinosaurs; in a sense they are bringing these remarkable creatures back to life. When it comes to dinosaur discovery, “I do genuinely think the golden age is right now,” says University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte.It’s fitting that dinosaurs are so persistently captivating. For 150 million years they dominated landscapes across ancient Earth, and they lived on what are now all seven continents. Dinosaurs were hugely successful during their reign, adapting into a bevy of shapes and sizes.Brusatte and others estimate that scientists have cataloged more than 1,100 species of extinct dinosaurs, and that’s just a subset of the species that once lived, because fossilization occurred in only a few environments. Their story continues to this day. When an asteroid slammed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago and wiped out three-quarters of life on Earth, one group of dinosaurs survived: the feathery creatures we now call birds. (Find out more on how the dinosaurs went extinct.)Western science has formally studied dinosaurs only since the 1820s, but what we’ve learned reveals a lot about how land animals are affected by our ever changing planet.As continents drifted apart and recombined—and as temperatures and sea levels rose and fell—dinosaurs persisted. What lessons can we take from their responses and resilience? Telling such an epic story requires a worldwide hunt for dinosaurs’ bones, and from Alaska to Zimbabwe, paleontologists are delivering as never before.One of the richest regions for new fossil finds is North Africa. Someone sweltering in the 105-degree heat of the Moroccan Sahara may find it tough to imagine that this landscape was once lush with waterways deep enough to host car-size fish. But National Geographic Explorer Nizar Ibrahim and his crew of paleontologists have returned to the region for years, chasing one of the weirdest dinosaurs ever found: a river monster called Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.The first Spinosaurus fossils were discovered in Egypt in the 1910s but were destroyed in a World War II bombing raid in Germany. Still, surviving field notes, sketches, and photographs of the original fossils, along with a few isolated bones and teeth found later in the 20th century, hinted that this mysterious, sail-backed creature had some kind of aquatic lifestyle. Spinosaurus had conical teeth well adapted for nabbing fish, for example, so paleontologists surmised that it perhaps prowled the shallows and plucked fish out of the water, as herons or grizzly bears do. Ibrahim and his colleagues therefore made a huge splash in 2014 when they described a new partial skeleton of the animal found in Morocco, and used it to make the case that Spinosaurus spent much of its time swimming and feeding in the water.To buttress the claims, Ibrahim’s team returned to the arid site in 2018 with the support of the National Geographic Society in hopes of finding more parts of the creature. The dig was brutal. To clear tons of rock, the crew bought the region’s only working jackhammer, which broke within minutes, forcing them to seek repairs from the seller of the defective tool. Several team members were hospitalized for exhaustion once they returned home. But fueled by Nutella and the promise of discovery, they started finding one vertebra after another from Spinosaurus’s tail, sometimes just minutes and inches apart. The diggers were so giddy over the trove of fossils, they drummed out musical beats with their rock hammers and broke into song.Shaped like a paddle some 17 feet long, the unearthed appendage, unveiled earlier this year in the journal Nature, is the most extreme aquatic adaptation ever found in a large predatory dinosaur. It’s a hard-won revelation that stretches the outer bounds of how researchers thought dinosaurs moved through their environments. “This is going to become a symbol, an icon, of African paleontology,” Ibrahim tells me.The story of Spinosaurus, with its desert vistas and historical intrigue, feels as if it could have been lifted from a movie script. But subsequent research on the fossil tail has shown just how different today’s study of dinosaurs can be.As part of his work, Ibrahim traveled from Casablanca to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Harvard University lab of biologist George Lauder. By his own admission, Lauder is no paleontologist: He specializes in studying how aquatic animals move in water, using high-speed cameras and robots to figure out how they swim. To put Spinosaurus to the test, Lauder mounts an eight-inch-long, orange plastic cutout of the dinosaur’s tail to a metal rod attached to a $5,000 force transducer—part of a robotic “flapper” that dangles from the ceiling.“It’s like a medieval torture device,” quips Harvard paleobiologist Stephanie Pierce, who designed and led the experiments, as Lauder lowers the robot into a flume.Once submerged, the mounted tail springs to life, flapping back and forth and sending data from the apparatus to nearby computers. Pierce and Lauder’s results show that Spinosaurus’s tail could deliver more than eight times the forward thrust in water of the tails of related, landlubbing dinosaurs. A beast longer than Tyrannosaurus rex appears to have swum its way through rivers like a crocodile. “Where we started was, a dinosaur paleontologist gets in touch with another paleontologist, who gets in touch with a fish bioroboticist,” Pierce says. “If you want to do modern, cutting-edge research, it takes a team of people from very diverse backgrounds.”These kinds of interdisciplinary lab experiments now define dinosaur research. Modern computers let scientists crunch through huge data sets of skeletal features and build dinosaur family trees. Close examinations of bone slices thinner than sheets of printer paper reveal, in detail, the length and timing of dinosaurs’ growth spurts. And with the same models used to forecast climate change, paleontologists can virtually sling an asteroid at Earth as it was 66 million years ago, to watch dinosaur habitats shrink in the resulting apocalyptic winter.Few technologies have so profoundly altered our view of dinosaurs as medical CT scanning, which is now a standard in the paleo tool kit.“We’ve been able to pull all of these extinct bones into a computer, where we can do things with them,” says Ohio University paleontologist Lawrence Witmer. “We can reconstruct missing bits … and do crash tests and run simulations and better understand how these animals actually functioned.”Scanning also eliminates a past trade-off: whether to sacrifice a fossil’s soft-tissue imprints to whittle down to bones. Stories abound of dinosaur skin impressions being ground to dust during preparation. Now, researchers virtually cleave bone from rock. “It does make you wonder, what things have we overlooked or bulldozed through?” says Mark Witton, a paleoartist at the U.K.’s University of Portsmouth.The field’s modern sense of caution has yielded an avalanche of discoveries. Recently Witmer used CT scans to show that major groups of dinosaurs evolved distinct cranial air-conditioning systems to keep their brains from overheating. Armored dinosaurs, such as the ankylosaur Euoplocephalus, relied on their nasal passages, which evolved into ducts shaped like crazy straws to shed heat as the animal breathed, cooling the blood destined for the brain. By contrast, large predators such as T. rex vented excess heat with large snout sinuses. Like blacksmiths working bellows, the dinosaurs flexed their jaws to force air in and out of the chambers, causing moisture to evaporate and wick away heat, like sweat on a summer day.CT scans also can give us a sense of how dinosaurs moved and changed as they grew. Using x-ray videos and computer animations of alligators and birds, the University of South Florida’s Ryan Carney built 3D models that revealed in 2016 that the feathered dinosaur Archaeopteryx could flap its wings in a way that enabled self-powered flight. And to understand how the Patagonian herbivore Mussaurus grew up, Argentine researcher Alejandro Otero assembled scans of the dinosaur’s bones in a computer to simulate its stance at different ages. Just like human babies, Mussaurus hatchlings walked on all fours and then matured into walking more upright on their two hind limbs.The deeper paleontologists can look into each new bit of bone, the more they can unravel precious details about the past—and that means they’ve had to seriously scale up their tools.In the northwestern corner of Grenoble, France, on a triangular spit of land where two rivers meet, a gray ring half a mile around rises out of the smog. It’s as if aliens had touched down in the Alps for some skiing and a spot of fondue. The eerie structure is the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, which in recent years has become a mecca for paleontologists, thanks to staff researcher Paul Tafforeau.The ESRF is a particle accelerator that flings electrons around at nearly the speed of light. As the electron beam makes its laps, magnets along the circular track bend the particle stream. The disruption makes the particles give off some of the world’s most intense x-rays, which researchers often use to study new materials and medicines. Tafforeau specializes in using the x-rays to look inside fossils that typical CT scanners can’t make sense of, at resolutions those scanners can’t reach.As we tour the accelerator’s steel and concrete innards, I ask Tafforeau just how discerning the machine can get. He gestures to a display case, with 3D-printed examples of past fossils he’s x-rayed. Portions of one of them, a burrow more than 250 million years old, were scanned finely enough to resolve details as narrow as a human red blood cell. When conditions are just right, Tafforeau’s scans can show features less than a hundredth of that width. Such is the power of a magnifying glass the size of a football stadium.With great power, though, comes great responsibility. To illustrate the importance of safety to new students, Tafforeau uses an unfiltered beam to light objects on fire and roast coffee beans. “Most of the beams we are using to scan fossils would kill you in just a few seconds,” he says.The ESRF’s intensity has worked wonders for Dennis Voeten of Sweden’s Uppsala University, who used it to virtually slice through Archaeopteryx fossils and trace out the cross sections of the bones in exacting detail. Because bones must withstand the strain of flight, their geometric structure can speak to the animals’ flying styles. Though Archaeopteryx’s anatomy didn’t allow for a fully birdlike flap, the cross sections of its wing bones most closely resemble those in living pheasants, which fly in short bursts. It’s a striking hint at how the 150-million-year-old creature—an iconic snapshot of dinosaurs’ evolution into birds—navigated the Jurassic island chains it may once have called home.Kimi Chapelle of South Africa’s University of the Witwatersrand has used the facility to look inside the world’s oldest known dinosaur eggs, which belong to the southern African herbivore Massospondylus. The x-rays let her reconstruct the embryonic skulls inside, down to tiny teeth the dinosaur would have either shed or reabsorbed before hatching. Modern gecko embryos also have these prototeeth, despite the fact that geckos’ and dinosaurs’ last common ancestors lived more than a quarter billion years ago. Thanks in part to geckos, Chapelle figured out that the Massospondylus embryos made it three-fifths of the way through their incubation before dying—an intimate glimpse into lives cut short more than 200 million years ago. “That makes them feel much more real,” she tells me.Each spring Beijing’s Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology welcomes its own symbol of life’s ephemeral nature, as a blanket of cherry and plum blossoms unfurls across the Chinese capital. To Jingmai O’Connor, the scene is impossibly charming: Gargoyles sculpted in the likenesses of ancient fish, dinosaurs, and saber-toothed cats look out from the main building onto gaggles of laughing schoolchildren. “It’s like paleontology Disneyland, almost,” the IVPP researcher says.On the inside, though, the IVPP is more time machine than theme park. Since the 1990s, farmers, researchers, and fossil dealers in northeastern China’s Liaoning Province have brought in hundreds of fossils that have upended our understanding of how dinosaurs looked and behaved. Many preserve traces of feathers that confirm plumage first evolved before dinosaurs ever flew. Some fossils also reveal, in dramatic fashion, that dinosaurs other than birds’ closest ancestors also tried defying gravity.Few dinosaurs better reflect the constantly shifting picture than the scansoriopterygids (SCAN-soar-ee-OP-tuh-RIH-jidz), an obscure group of Jurassic dinosaurs with a mouthful of a name. Some scientists once thought that the crow-size animals used their four-inch-long fingers to nab bugs, like modern aye-ayes do. But in 2015, IVPP researchers unveiled a bizarre member of the group that turned out to be a lost dead end in the origins of flight. Unlike any other dinosaur ever found, Yi qi had batlike membranous wings that it supported with its long outer fingers and bony wrist spurs. “That’s what the story is: One very important specimen … really just kind of knocked everything that we thought we knew upside down,” O’Connor says.China’s fossils, and others from equally remarkable sites around the world, preserve vestiges of all kinds of tissue. In 2014 researchers announced they had found an Edmontosaurus regalis, a type of hadrosaur, in western Canada that has a cockscomb of mummified flesh, like what you’d see on a rooster. This is a structure nobody knew the dinosaur had, despite knowing of the species for nearly a century. Dinosaurs’ bones had shown that the creatures used exaggerated body parts to woo mates and jockey for social status, just like modern animals, or to find their kin. With Edmontosaurus and other dinosaurs bearing soft tissues, paleontologists are seeing hints of these displays’ true splendor.In a few cases, researchers can even infer some of the animals’ original chemistries. In 2008 scientists led by paleontologist Jakob Vinther, now of the U.K.’s University of Bristol, figured out that melanosomes, tiny subcellular sacs filled with the pigment melanin, could fossilize. The discovery opened the door to a field once thought impossible: figuring out the colors of extinct dinosaurs’ skin and feathers, based on the shapes, sizes, and arrangements of their melanosomes.These reconstructions come with caveats: Living animals employ other pigments besides melanin, and some extinct dinosaurs probably did too. Even so, recent finds have been astonishing. The feathered dinosaur Anchiornis, which lived in what is now China, had a reddish crest; the early ceratopsian Psittacosaurus had red-brown skin that contributed to an early form of dino camouflage. In 2018 an international team reported that the feathers of Caihong, a dinosaur that lived in the same region as Yi qi, once shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow.Even more of life’s molecules may last through deep time. In the 2000s, North Carolina State University paleontologist Mary Schweitzer made waves when she found that some dinosaur fossils, including T. rex specimens, contained preserved cells, blood vessels, and maybe even vestiges of proteins. Ever since, Schweitzer and a growing cohort of scientists have asked how such substances could persist—and what we could learn from them.At her lab in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale Ph.D. candidate Jasmina Wiemann shows me how she grinds up a small piece of Allosaurus bone for analysis. She transfers the dust into a tube and invites me to add an acid solution, which fizzes and turns a deep brown. “It reminds me always a little bit of Coca-Cola,” she says. Under a microscope, the gunk left behind includes spongy mahogany chunks shot through with black squiggles. I can’t believe what I’m seeing. The brown schmutz was once protein-rich tissue. The squiggles? The outlines of bone cells that lived more than 145 million years ago in a toothy Jurassic predator as long as a school bus. After millions of years, heat and pressure often will transform these kinds of microscopic remains through chemical reactions. Despite their altered state, the materials hold invaluable clues to dinosaur behavior. In a 2018 study Wiemann showed that when certain dinosaur eggshells are struck with a laser, the light that scatters back reveals degraded protoporphyrin and biliverdin, compounds that give modern bird eggs color and speckling.Based on such analysis, the calcified eggs of the Velociraptor relative Deinonychus had a bluish hue, suggesting that like modern birds with similarly colorful eggs, the dinosaur had open-air nests and brooded its young. By contrast, fossilized Protoceratops embryos found in Mongolia and Mussaurus embryos from Patagonia are surrounded by what was once leathery eggshell, according to a study Wiemann co-authored this year. The find suggests not only that these dinosaurs buried their nests like modern sea turtles do, but also that the first dinosaurs’ eggs were similarly soft. That adds a twist to dinosaurs’ evolutionary story, since it implies hard eggshells—which are found throughout the group Dinosauria—must not have a common origin. Instead, the trait evolved at least three times.More than anything else, scientific advances show us that dinosaurs weren’t the one-note menaces we sometimes see in popular culture. They courted each other with elaborate displays and squabbled for social status. They suffered broken bones and infections. They snapped after bugs and nibbled on ferns. Their days were as rich and varied, frenzied and humdrum, as those of the birds outside our windows. Even the biggest, baddest T. rex sometimes took a nap.It’s a realization that hits me as I walk through the lab of Yale assistant professor Bhart-Anjan Bhullar, whose cramped office is just down the hall from Wiemann’s. Bhullar might work in a geology department, but he’s taken only three geology classes in his life. He studies fossils and the embryos of living animals to try to unlock how ancient dinosaurs begot birds.If anyone could genetically tweak a bird and make a chickensaurus, it’s probably Bhullar. In one 2012 study he found that bird skulls are riffs on ancient dinosaurs’ juvenile skulls, developmentally speaking: Young dinosaur skulls had thinner bones and more flexibility, which birds leveraged to evolve beaks. Parts of the old tool kit survived. Bhullar also has shown that blocking the beak’s key molecular pathways can give chicken embryos Archaeopteryx-like snouts.Across the avian body plan, Bhullar has found other striking examples of how bird embryos essentially summarize their own evolutionary history. He shows me a microscope image of a quail embryo’s forelimb, which looks exactly like the arm of a raptor dinosaur, down to its tiny dinosaurian hand. “That’s Deinonychus! Look at that!” Bhullar exclaims as he points to his laptop. Only closer to hatching is this ancestral form overwritten to become the familiar avian wing.Long after I leave Yale I can’t get that little quail claw out of my head. After years of reporting on extinct dinosaurs, I’ve grown dangerously accustomed to thinking about them in the past tense. But they are still with us, as ghosts within the eggs of their avian descendants.The links between past and present get clearer in London, as our time on Dinosaur Island draws to a close. While the dinosaurs’ world ended in a flash, the Crystal Palace dinosaurs face a slower, more creeping threat. The sculptures have been added to the U.K.’s registry of at-risk heritage, but a lack of upkeep has let cracks splinter through many of their discolored exteriors. In May part of the face broke off the island’s Megalosaurus, damage caused either by deterioration or possibly by vandals. Conservation efforts are being planned, led by Friends of Crystal Palace Dinosaurs.With the need for renewal all around us, I ask Maidment how today’s scientists would build their version of Crystal Palace Park. Maidment offers an elegant answer: She’d fill it with birds. “Dinosaurs are the most diverse terrestrial vertebrates alive today, you know,” she says, as a flock of gulls glides overhead and splashes down into the waters beyond. “They never stopped.”",
"This illustration depicts Ambopteryx longibrachium, a newfound species of nonavian theropod dinosaur that had bat-like membrane wings. It lived in what's now China about 163 million years ago.More than 160 million years ago, the forests of ancient China were home to a bizarre predator: a tiny dinosaur that glided from tree to tree with leathery, bat-like wings. The newfound fossil, unveiled today in the journal Nature, is just the second feathered dinosaur found with signs of large membranes on its wings. Fitting, then, that the animal's newly assigned genus name is Ambopteryx: Latin for “both wings.”“The most exciting thing, for me, is that it shows that some dinosaurs evolved very different structures to become volant,” or capable of some form of flight, says lead study author Min Wang, a paleontologist at China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.Ambopteryx is now the best known fossil of a scansoriopterygid (scan-soary-OP-teh-rigid), an oddball group of nonavian dinosaurs that includes Yi qi, the first dinosaur ever found with bat-like wings. That fossil find—announced in 2015 by study coauthor Xing Xu, the IVPP's deputy director—reshaped how scientists understood the evolution of flight.“Before the discovery of Yi qi, every flying dinosaur we found, we tried to fit on one evolutionary lineage toward birds,” says study coauthor Jingmai O'Connor, an IVPP paleontologist who specializes in ancient birds. “Yi qi really just shattered that idea.” (O'Connor also helped describe the first bird fossil found with an egg inside.)Some researchers now think that flight arose at least four separate times within dinosaurs, including among scansoriopterygids. But healthy skepticism around Yi qi lingered. The animal has strange, rod-like bones called styliform elements that jut off its wrists, and paleontologists thought they might be there to help prop up a large wing membrane. But no other dinosaur, living or dead, also had such a bone—until Ambopteryx.The newfound fossil not only has styliform elements, it also preserves a brownish film on one wing—a material that's thought to be traces of wing membrane. What's more, Ambopteryx has fossilized feathers and a pygostyle, a group of fused tail vertebrae that anchors the tail feathers in living birds.A local farmer found the Ambopteryx fossil in 2017 outside a village near Lingyuan, a city in northeastern China's Liaoning Province. When the IVPP first acquired the fossil, researchers thought it might be an early bird, so Wang—an expert on the early evolution of birds—took the lead. But as preparators carefully removed excess rock, Wang realized that the animal wasn't a bird at all. (Find out more about birds, the dinosaurs that didn't die.)Now fully exposed, the fossil preserves in detail how Ambopteryx made its living. In all likelihood, it was an opportunistic omnivore: Its stomach contains gizzard stones like those in today's plant-eating birds, but it also bears bone fragments, signs that the creature enjoyed a meaty snack soon before death. The adult animal weighed just a few hundred grams, give or take.Researchers are still crunching the numbers on how well it could have flown—though at a minimum, it looks well-suited to gliding among trees. Its feet suggest that it evolved to perch on trees, but rather than acting like a songbird, the team thinks it may have behaved like today's flying squirrels and sugar gliders.“It probably would have been climbing around in the trees—like a little, creepy-looking dinosaur squirrel—and then flying from branch to branch,” O'Connor says.“If you were going to get a gliding arboreal theropod, it would be a really weird animal, and it would look pretty much like this,” says University of Southern California paleontologist Mike Habib, a biomechanics expert who is studying the flight of Yi qi.Scientists are keen to find more hints of soft tissue in Ambopteryx, which new imaging techniques could make easier. For instance, University of Hong Kong paleontologist Michael Pittman has used lasers to reveal soft-tissue traces in fossils of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.And Pittman is no stranger to scansoriopterygids. At the 2018 meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, Pittman's Ph.D. student Arindam Roy presented early results from the lab's laser scans of Yi qi. Wang and Pittman say they are talking to each other about doing a similar analysis of Ambopteryx.To get clearer answers, paleontologists say the ideal would be to find an even better-preserved relative of Ambopteryx. That's a lot to ask for—but sites in China preserve feathered dinosaurs in mind-boggling detail. Perhaps an even more pristine bat-winged creature is waiting to be unearthed.“We've gotten so used to great Chinese fossils, we start making really inappropriate asks, like, Well, why didn't you find one that's preserved perfectly in every detail and shows everything laid out?” Habib quips. “It's totally raised the bar of what a good fossil is.”",
"Since most dinosaur names consist of long, polysyllabic gargles—Parasaurolophus, Therizinosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus—it is refreshing that the latest addition to the family has the shortest one yet.It is simply Yi.In full, it is Yi qi, which comes from the Mandarin for “strange wing” and can be roughly butchered as “ee chee”. The name hints at this pigeon-sized animal’s most remarkable feature. Each of its hands had a long bony rod extending from the wrist. This rod seemed to support a membrane, much like that of a flying squirrel or bat.Yi was a dinosaur with bat-like wings! What an astonishing find!Until now, the assumption was that prehistoric reptiles took to the skies in one of two different ways. The dinosaurs did so with feathers. Many species were covered in downy insulating fuzz, and some small predatory species elaborated these into true, flight-capable feathers—long, flat vanes that protruded from their arms (and sometimes their legs). These winged creatures gave rise to the first birds. Meanwhile, the pterosaurs evolved a very different type of wing, by greatly lengthening their fourth fingers to support a membrane of skin and muscle. (Pterosaurs are often lumped with dinosaurs but belonged to a totally separate group.)These wings were mutually exclusive: dinosaur or pterosaur, feathery or leathery. But Yi went for both options! It had membrane wings with a feathery covering on the leading edge. It shows that at least some dinosaurs had independently evolved the same kind of wings as pterosaurs—an extraordinary example of convergent evolution.“This is refreshingly weird,” says Daniel Ksepka from the Bruce Museum, who was not involved in the study. “Paleontologists will be thinking about Yi qi for a long time, and we can surely expect some interesting research into the structure and function of the wing.”There’s only one known fossil of Yi. A farmer in China’s Hebei Province found it around eight years ago., and the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature bought it shortly after. Xing Xu and Xioating Zheng from Linyi University, who discovered the creature, first laid eyes on it in 2009 and started working on it in 2013. “It looked special to me,” Xu recalls.As the team exposed and analysed the specimen, they worked out that it was a scansoriopterygid—a group of small, feathered dinosaurs with very long third fingers. These species were reputedly good climbers (their name means “climbing wing”) but there was no evidence that their feathers were good enough for flight.The same applied to Yi—its feathers, covering its skull, neck and limbs, were stiff filaments that ended in paintbrush-like tips. They were very different to the flight-capable plumes of birds.Then, the team noticed the weird rod. It stuck out from each of the dinosaur’s wrists and was longer than its forearm. It’s not a finger, but its chemical composition revealed that it is indeed a bone, or perhaps a piece of hardened cartilage. The team had no idea what it was. “When I saw the bone, I was really confused,” says Xu. “There is nothing comparable in any other dinosaur.”But, as Corwin Sullivan from the Chinese Academy of Sciences realised, there is something comparable in flying squirrels. These rodents glide from tree to tree by expanding a membrane that stretches from their wrists to their ankles. They deploy this membrane by splaying their limbs and extending a long piece of cartilage (called the styliform process) that protrudes from their wrists. Bats have a similar piece of cartilage (the calcar) on their feet, and pterosaurs had a similar bone (the pteroid) on their arms.All of these structures do the same thing: they support a membrane that keeps their owner in the air. Yi’s wrist rod was almost certainly fulfilling the same role. “As far as i know, this is the only plausible interpretation,” says Xu. He even found several patches of what look like sheet-like membranes, surrounding the rods and fingers of both hands. Again, they’re unlike anything seen in other dinosaurs.“The ‘bone’ seems to be what they say it is, and they have made appropriate studies to show it isn’t something else,” says Michael Benton from the University of Bristol. “So, yes, it seems real, and, my goodness, what a further broadening of flight capabilities in paravians!” (That’s the group of dinosaurs that includes the scansoriopterygids, celebrities like Velociraptor, and all birds.)But Yi “is not necessarily as weird as it might first seem, in an evolutionary sense,” says Michael Habib from the University of Southern California. “Living birds actually have membranes around their forelimbs, including a well-developed membrane in front of the elbow called a propatagium. Feathers cover [these] parts of the wing, obscuring the soft tissues.” Yi simply extended these membranous parts with the help of their weird extra bone.For the moment, the team can’t work out how it held its wrist rods, and so can’t reconstruct the true shape or capabilities of the extended wing. This is crucial. A broad membrane, Habib says, would have kept Yi qi stable in the air, and allowed it to launch and land safely. With a narrower membrane, it would have needed to fly or flap very fast to stay airborne, and to take off at high speeds.“Yi might have moved through the air with a combination of flapping and gliding flight, though it probably relied more on gliding,” says Xu, who is planning to search for more specimens. “There are many questions remaining to answer about this bizarre dinosaur.”For now, this discovery reminds us that the evolution of flight among birds and other dinosaurs was not a simple story. In the late Jurassic period, when Yi lived, there were all manner of dinosaurs with varying shapes, sizes, and numbers of wings. It was a world of not-quite-birds and just-about-birds—and now bat-winged dinosaurs, too! “What a grand age of experimentation!“ says Ksepka.“This may also be evidence that flight evolved multiple times within dinosaurs—perhaps three or more times,” adds Habib.Reference: Xu, Zheng, Sullivan, Wang, Xing, Wang, Zhang, O’Connor, Zhang & Pan. 2015. A bizarre Jurassic maniraptoran theropod with preserved evidence of membranous wings. Nature http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14423PS: Here’s another odd thing about Yi. Its feathers preserve traces of melanosomes—small sacs of coloured pigments. That’s not unusual in itself; several scientists have used melanosomes to reconstruct the colours of fossil feathers. But Yi has some of the largest melanosomes ever seen. “I had to double-check to make sure I did not misread the measurements,” says Ksepka.",
"In this illustration, a colony of Avimaia schweitzerae nests on a lakeshore in what would become northwest China. Somehow, one female ended up dead in the water—eventually yielding the first fossil bird ever found with an unlaid egg inside.About 115 million years ago in what's now northwest China, a female bird was on the verge of motherhood. But somehow, her life on an ancient lakeshore took a traumatic turn, triggering a pregnancy complication that killed the egg forming inside her and may have even led to her death.Entombed ever since, this mother bird is now a paleontology milestone: Named Avimaia schweitzerae, the newly described species is the first fossil bird known to science that contains an unlaid egg.“We were not expecting anything interesting, but it turned out to be the first fossil bird ever found with an egg inside its body,” says lead study author Alida Bailleul, a postdoctoral researcher at China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP). “To me, that’s the funniest thing.”Described this week in Nature Communications, the egg could shed light on reproductive disorders in ancient birds. And if its pigments are preserved, the fossil could reveal more about how ancient birds nested. Previous research has shown that the colors and speckles on dinosaur eggshells may vary depending on the dinosaur's nesting behavior, such as whether the species buries its eggs or broods them. This pattern holds true in the only dinosaurs alive today: birds.The discovery adds to a growing string of spectacular fossil birds unveiled in recent months. In January 2019, a team led by paleontologist Jingmai O'Connor—Bailleul's supervisor and coauthor—unveiled a pristine 99-million-year-old bird foot preserved in amber. Nearly three months before, a team led by paleontologist Julia Clarke reported on a new fossil bird so well-preserved, the patterns on its feathers are still visible.And in December, O'Connor unveiled another ancient bird with probable medullary bone, a special type of bone found only in reproductively active female birds. Avimaia is also thought to preserve medullary bone. If so, it would be the first fossil ever found with both this bone type and an egg, providing a unique example of the link between medullary bone and avian reproduction.In this photograph of the Avimaia schweitzerae fossil, the preserved egg is visible as a brown, leathery mass near the center of the bird's body.This line of research traces back more than a decade, to a pioneering 2005 paper by paleontologist Mary Schweitzer that found signs of medullary bone in Tyrannosaurus rex. To honor Schweitzer's contributions to paleontology, Bailleul named the new fossil for her.“Is that not the coolest thing ever? I was just so surprised—I’m hugely honored,” Schweitzer says.Avimaia's path to the spotlight took more than a decade. In the mid-2000s, IVPP paleontologists dug up fossils from northwest China's Xiagou Formation, which has yielded many fossils of an extinct bird group called the enantiornithines. At the time, researchers including O'Connor noticed that one of the fossils had a weird, membrane-like structure. But the team moved on and kept the fossil in storage.In 2018, Bailleul arrived at the IVPP looking for a first project. Since her specialty is preserved soft tissues, she and O'Connor combed through the institute's storage for unstudied specimens.“We were just going through boxes, and then [O'Connor] said, Oh, look at this, I remember this fossil!” Bailleul says. She and her colleague Shukang Zhang then began sampling the fossil and, to the team's delight, it dawned on them that the fossil's enigmatic “soft tissue” was, in fact, eggshell.“I couldn’t even sleep at night...I was like, my god, this is an egg,” Bailleul says.Some parts of the egg had up to six layers—which may hint at how the mother bird died. In living birds, trauma can cause a female to delay laying her eggs and instead encase it in several more eggshell layers. This “egg binding” not only suffocates the developing embryo, which researchers did not find in the fossil, but in extreme cases, it also can kill the mother.Cross-sections of Avimaia bone may also show how the bird built the egg in the first place.To help build their eggshells, modern reproductively active birds pack their skeletons with a calcium reservoir called medullary bone. In addition to T. rex, previous studies found what looks like medullary bone in pterosaur fossils. But successfully identifying fossil medullary bone is tricky; it's a temporary structure, and bone diseases can yield similar-looking tissues. This in turn makes it hard to know whether something that looks like ancient medullary bone is truly linked to reproduction.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.In Avimaia, Bailleul's team found medullary-like bony layers precisely where scientists would expect medullary bone to be, and the bone surfaces don't looked diseased. Most of all, thanks to the egg, the bird's reproductive status is beyond dispute.Schweitzer says that Bailleul's case is convincing: “At this point, what else can it be?” she says. “I'd like to see chemistry done, and maybe eventually they will get to that ... but the preponderance of evidence supports it being medullary bone.”Avimaia's egg could yield further molecular secrets, adds paleontologist Jasmina Wiemann, a Ph.D. student at Yale. For one, depending on their arrangement, tiny crystals that Bailleul's team found in the sample could have given the eggshell a glossy sheen like the eggs of today's tinamou, she says.Beyond shine, chemical studies could also reveal shade. In her previous work, Wiemann reconstructed dinosaur eggs' colors and speckles, which likely correspond to nesting strategies. If Avimaia's egg preserves pigments, tests could therefore reveal how the bird may have nested—and even how it raised its young.“This is a spectacular fossil with a lot of potential for future paleobiological investigations,” Wiemann says in an email. “I would be thrilled to analyze pigment contents in this eggshell!”",
"Modern bird eggs come in a huge diversity of hues, like these samples in the collection of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in Los Angeles, California.Since the time of Aristotle, humans have stood amazed by birds' dazzlingly colorful eggs, which range from creamy hues to the deepest reds, blues, and greens. But long before our love of robin's-egg blue, nature may well have given us Velociraptor's-egg blue. After all, modern birds inherited their knack for vibrant eggshells from their dinosaur ancestors, which first gained the trait more than 145 million years ago, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature.The result adds new color to our understanding of dinosaur reproduction. It may also leave you wondering: How did these dinosaurs hatch their eggs and rear their young in the first place? And in light of the latest fossils, what can we learn about dinosaur parenting from today's birds—the last living dinosaurs?With each new find, it becomes clearer that modern birds got many of their iconic traits from their dinosaur ancestors. Feathers, for instance, have popped up thousands of times in the fossil record since the 1990s. And just a few weeks ago, researchers unveiled what seem to be fossilized lungs in an early type of bird that lived 120 million years ago. That Cretaceous fossil suggests that hyper-efficient lungs adapted for flight emerged in the bird family tree far earlier than previously thought.Such birdlike traits arose within the eumaniraptorans, the dinosaur group that includes modern birds, theropod dinosaurs such as Velociraptor and Deinonychus, and nonavian feathered dinosaurs. During the late Jurassic, these animals seem to have diversified rapidly. University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Julia Clarke has speculated that as this radiation kicked into gear, eumaniraptorans evolved a higher metabolism. And during this metabolic shift—or even perhaps because of it—eumaniraptorans became quite the invested parents.Some dinosaur groups, such as the long-necked sauropods, laid small eggs en masse and buried them, leaving them behind like sea turtles. Eumaniraptorans' eggs, however, are relatively bigger and were laid only a few at a time. In some fossil egg clusters, the eggs are visibly paired off—a sign that they were laid more slowly. And in 2005, researchers unveiled the pelvis of a eumaniraptoran that contained two shelled eggs.Unlike other dinosaurs' eggs, eumaniraptoran eggs didn't have that many pores, a sign that the eggs were kept in open, more birdlike nests. Perhaps, like many birds, the animals brooded their eggs to keep them warm; some fossilized egg clusters even preserve adult dinosaurs sitting atop them. And analyses of some dinosaur embryos suggests that these eggs took about ten weeks to incubate—faster than living reptiles, but slower than modern birds.Because their eggs were exposed, eumaniraptorans may have had good reason to color them with hues and speckles, as revealed by the newest Nature paper. Unlike humans, which have three types of light-sensitive cells in their eyes, birds and dinosaurs had four and so would have perceived color differently from us. In particular, their eyes would have seen calcite, the white mineral that makes up eggshell, in a whole other light.“To a bird or to a dinosaur, a non-pigmented white egg would look glowing pink,” says paleontologist Jasmina Wiemann, a Ph.D. student at Yale University and lead author of the Nature paper. “If we think of a nest predator, whenever he or she sees glowing pink eggs at the ground, it's like—this is lunch. Once dinosaurs started to incorporate these pigments, this glowing pink of the eggshell basically disappears.”As Wiemann and her colleagues show, the dinosaur Deinonychus probably had blue eggs like today's emus, while other species had whitish, speckled eggs like today's sparrows. (Read more about the first known dinosaur with colorful eggs.)“It seems that nonavian dinosaur eggshells had a diversity of egg color that pretty much equals what we see in modern bird eggs,” Wiemann says. “They come in all sorts of colors, with or without spots.”The new evidence makes a lot of sense if these dinosaurs did indeed lay their eggs in open nests, says Montana State University paleontologist David Varricchio. If you're burying your eggs, why invest the extra energy to color them?“It’s nice to have that confirmation from an unexpected source,” he says.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.Researchers still have a long way to go to figure out the details of dinosaurs' parenting styles once the eggs have hatched. Case in point: the eumaniraptoran Deinonychus, a long-clawed North American carnivore that lived between 100 and 120 million years ago. Deinonychus is often found alongside the plant-eating dinosaur Tenontosaurus, and there's solid evidence of the former nibbling on the latter. But the two animals were very different sizes: Deinonychus weighed about 200 pounds, while Tenontosaurus could weigh a couple of tons. How did Deinonychus hunt such a large animal?In the 1960s, paleontologist John Ostrom suggested that the creatures hunted Tenontosaurus in packs, like wolves. Ever since, the idea has spread like wildfire, gaining notoriety in the first Jurassic Park movie.“That has been the go-to hypothesis for 40 years, and it's been depicted in popular culture over and over,” says Joe Frederickson, a paleontologist at Southwestern Oklahoma State University. “But the fact is, there's very little evidence that supports that.”Whether Deinonychus was a pack-hunting “clever girl” would directly shape at least one aspect of its parenting. Modern wolves share their kills with their young, and as the pack eats, there's only a low risk of a wolf pup becoming a meal itself. But in 2007, two researchers suggested that Deinonychus ate more like today's Komodo dragons. Under this model, adults would barely tolerate each other at a shared meal and would more opportunistically cannibalize their young. As a result, juveniles would avoid the adults and scrounge up their own meals.To test which model better fit Deinonychus, Frederickson chemically tested small and large Deinonychus teeth from sites in Montana and Oklahoma, using tooth size as a loose proxy for the dinosaurs' ages. At the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's recent annual meeting, Frederickson announced that larger Deinonychus were eating different foods from the smaller ones—a clue that the dinosaurs might not have been pack hunters after all.However, that doesn't necessarily mean Deinonychus treated its young the way Komodo dragons treat their own, Frederickson says. After all, in some living birds, hatched chicks follow their fathers around for protection, but they still find their own food.To keep piecing together the puzzle, Wiemann wants to sample more fossil eggshells, especially from large-bodied theropods such as T. rex or Spinosaurus. She also wants to study living birds in greater detail, to see whether subtle patterns or colors correlate to specific types of nesting or parental care.“Once we have solid data from modern birds, our only surviving dinosaurs, we can easily apply it to nonavian dinosaurs,” Wiemann says. “That will help us better understand why dinosaurs became the incredibly successful group that they were—and that they still are today.”",
"This fossil of the primitive bird Archaeorhynchus spathula preserves not only the animal's plumage but also its lung tissue.About 120 million years ago in what’s now northeastern China, a bird met its end during a volcanic eruption. Ashfall buried the animal so suddenly, its soft tissues didn’t have time to decay, and over millions of years, minerals infiltrated these tissues and preserved their form.Now, researchers have unveiled this breathtaking specimen, which contains the first fossilized lungs ever found in an early bird.The species Archaeorhynchus spathula lived alongside the nonavian dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period. The newfound fossil, which preserves feathers and considerable soft tissue, shows that this primitive bird's lungs closely resemble those found in living birds. This suggests that birds’ hyper-efficient lungs, a key adaptation for flight, first emerged earlier than thought, and it underscores how birds—the last living dinosaurs—inherited many iconic traits from their extinct ancestors.“Everything we knew about lungs, about respiration, about evolution of [birds] was just inferring based on skeletal indicators," says study coauthor Jingmai O’Connor, a paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. "And now we know that we were inferring less generously than we should have.”O’Connor presented the discovery on October 18 at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology’s annual meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the finding will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“This is an exciting discovery,” says Colleen Farmer, an anatomist and physiologist at the University of Utah who reviewed the study. “Finding bird-like lungs in this group of dinosaurs is to be expected, but it is incredible to uncover hard evidence of this soft structure.”Fossilization itself is rare, and rarer still are fossils that preserve traces of soft tissue. So far, researchers have found ancient fish with fossilized hearts and armored dinosaurs with pebbly skin. O’Connor herself has found ovarian follicles—the sacs that hold unfertilized eggs—in dinosaur-era birds. And three earlier studies have described bits and pieces of fossilized lung.Having the lungs of a fossil bird is exceptionally handy, though, when you’re trying to reconstruct how birds evolved into such effective fliers.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.Lungs work by exchanging oxygen and CO2 across a thin membrane full of blood vessels. The bigger and thinner this membrane is, the more efficient—and intricately folded—the lungs become. In some people, the inner surfaces of their lungs add up to more than 500 square feet.Since powered flight is a brutal workout, birds take their lungs to the extreme. They have such highly subdivided lungs, the tissues curl around their ribcages for support. Unlike in other animals, bird lungs don’t expand and contract. Instead, they’re connected to a series of separate air sacs that sit beneath the lungs and act as bellows. These adaptations, Farmer says, let the lung membranes get exceptionally thin—which makes them exceptionally efficient at absorbing oxygen, all the better for nourishing flight muscles. But when did these specialized lungs evolve?Initially, O’Connor and her colleagues at China’s Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature weren’t looking to figure out this respiratory riddle. Instead, they were interested in the fossil because it was the first that preserved A. spathula’s plumage, including its ornamental tail feathers—the first ever found in this group of extinct birds.But as O’Connor and her colleague Xiaoli Wang examined the fossil, they noticed two unusual mats of white speckled material in the bird’s torso. The structures formed two distinct lobes in the animal’s chest, a sign that they might be fossilized lungs.When the researchers initially wrote up a description of the fossil, they focused on the feathers, mentioning the possible lungs only in passing. According to O’Connor, their initial study was rejected after one reviewer lamented that the team hadn’t definitively proven the structures were lungs.In response, O’Connor and Wang decided to analyze the potential lungs in greater detail. Using powerful microscopes, the team revealed honeycombs of tiny voids less than a tenth of the width of a human hair. To make sense of these voids, O’Connor emailed University of Johannesburg professor John Maina, an expert on birds’ lung anatomy. Maina, who is one of the final study’s coauthors, replied that the structures looked like the finely subdivided inner chambers of a bird’s lungs. The microscopes even showed individual air channels.“They rejected me … and I was like, bone wars!” jokes O’Connor, referring to a period of intensely competitive fossil hunting in the 1800s. “So then I went and [examined] it, and I was like, boom! Lung tissue.”Other experts agree that O’Connor and her colleagues make a strong case that the structures are lungs.“More will need to be done to confirm this identity, but it looks very promising to me,” says University of Southern California paleontologist Mike Habib, an expert on the biomechanics of flying animals such as early birds.Many questions remain, however, such as how the lungs fossilized in the first place. University of South Florida paleontologist Ryan Carney, an expert on the feathered dinosaur Archaeopteryx, suggested one possible explanation in an email: “One hypothesis is that this potential lung preservation—and possibly the unusual, ‘speckled white material’ itself—was due to the bird's inhalation of volcanic ash.”In the meantime, O’Connor stresses the importance of studying fossils’ soft tissues whenever possible, since they can reveal features that bones simply can’t record.“A theme that's come up within paleontology the last five years is that when we learn about the soft tissues … we see that the skeleton always lags behind in the evolution of specialization,” she says. “When we’re just studying the skeleton, we’re basically being conservative.”",
"Pterosaurs fly over a volcanic landscape during the mass extinction event that killed the nonavian dinosaurs.A death shroud swept over the planet 66 million years ago, after a giant asteroid crashed into Earth, leaving a crater more than 110 miles wide on the Yucatán Peninsula centered on what is now the Mexican town of Chicxulub. This impact launched more than 12,000 cubic miles of material into the air, which caused a winter that lasted for decades and acidified the oceans. When the shroud lifted, three-quarters of all the species on Earth, including many dinosaurs, were dead.Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, the fallout wasn’t all bad.According to research conducted by an international collaboration of three dozen scientists, the mass extinction that marked the end of the Cretaceous period may have allowed the oceans to soften the blow from a massive volcanic eruption that occurred around the same time as the asteroid collision. The asteroid primed the seas to absorb some of the massive amounts of greenhouse gases emitted from a volcanic plateau in ancient India known as the Deccan Traps, dampening the warming that might otherwise have spelled trouble for early mammals and many of the other species that persisted after the impact.Studies suggest this epic eruption had already been underway for 400,000 years when the asteroid struck, and some scientists argue that the volcanic gases may have been partly responsible for the mass extinction. But based on new estimates of the global temperatures around this time—published Thursday in the journal Science—it seems unlikely the massive volcanoes contributed to the dinosaurs’ demise.The asteroid appears to have acted alone—and its dramatic influence on oceanic plankton may have tempered subsequent global warming as the volcanic eruptions continued for another 300,000 years.In muddy sediments sampled from the ocean floor, the sudden disappearance of plankton species with calcareous shells usually coincides with a layer of tiny glass beads that are known to have rained down after the asteroid hit, says Pincelli Hull, a paleoceanographer at Yale University who co-authored the study.“Since those species appear to have been hit hardest by the asteroid impact, we believe the sulfur and nitrous oxide released by the impact may have acidified the ocean, dissolving the creatures’ shells,” Hull says. It’d be akin to what happens when you throw a piece of chalk—which consists of the remains of calcareous plankton—into a glass of vinegar. The ocean was never that acidic, however, so the plankton shells would have dissolved much slower, and there would have been no fizz.The same sediments can also teach us how global temperatures have changed through time, Hull explains—changes that should reflect any large effects of the gases emitted by the Deccan volcanoes, including CO2.“The fine mud from the deep sea that we find in those samples has a consistency comparable to toothpaste,” Hull says. “It isn’t made up of rock, like the mud we are familiar with on land, but of microscopic fossils of calcareous plankton species that rain down to the seafloor after they die.”Merely identifying the plankton embedded in the various layers of the seafloor sediment can give an indication of the ocean climate at the time, with some species being “equivalent to finding palm trees on the North Pole,” Pincelli says.But the chemical compositions of their shells contain even more information.Ocean temperatures affected which kinds of carbon and oxygen isotopes the plankton incorporated into their protective shells. By combining data from deep sea mud collected around the world, the researchers could reconstruct how global temperatures changed over hundreds of thousands of years.To do this, the researchers adapted a computer model using equations that capture the relationship between the planet’s temperature changes and the carbon cycle during various periods of time, including the present.This model helps address a 40-year-old debate that was reignited by a pair of studies published last February, also in the journal Science.The best-supported scenarios posit that the Deccan’s greenhouse gases were either mostly released 200,000 to 350,000 years before the end-Cretaceous extinction, or about equally before and after the event. The latter possibility of an equal split was first hinted at by geochronologist Courtney Sprain of the University of Florida and her colleagues in one of the papers published last February.“I’m of course very excited to see that this study supports our findings,” Sprain says, and adds that both of last year’s studies allowed for half of the gases to have erupted after the asteroid hit. The main difference is the study led by geochronologist Blair Schoene proposed that a pulse of volcanism occurred within the 100,000-year timespan immediately before the extinction event. This pulse would have disrupted the environment and conspired with the asteroid to drive the global devastation of the planet’s species.  But this scenario isn’t supported by the new computer model, which instead insists that global temperatures cooled in the period leading up to the asteroid collision.That still leaves the question of how much of the gases were emitted before and after the mass extinction. Looking at clear periods of warming closest to the asteroid impact reveals one peak of about 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) around 200,000 years before the mass extinction. A second, much less pronounced spell of warming occurred about 200,000 years after the event.But less warming does not necessarily mean that the Deccan volcanoes were emitting less gas, says Donald Penman, a Yale geochemist and co-creator of the new models. There may be a more intriguing explanation.“After most of the calcareous plankton went extinct, the model suggests the build-up of compounds they would otherwise have used in their shells allowed the oceans to absorb more volcanic CO2, reducing its global warming effect,” Penman says.Heather Birch, a micropaleontologist at the University of Bristol in England who wasn’t involved in making the models, agrees the plankton composition looked very different in the time after the asteroid impact, and that this may have affected the uptake of carbon. But Birch warns that “only a small fraction of the plankton fossilizes, so more research is needed for us to learn how these large amounts of CO2 would have been absorbed.”But given that oceans are currently acidifying again, this time due to a human-caused rise in CO2, could another mass extinction of calcareous plankton save us from the worst of climate change?Hull says don’t hold your breath. After the end-Cretaceous plankton die-off, temperatures rose for thousands of years before the oceans started absorbing more CO2. On a timescale relevant to human society, this means we’d have millennia of upheaval ahead.",
"Two Spinosaurus aegyptiacus hunt Onchopristis, a prehistoric sawfish, in the waters of a vast river system that once covered Morocco more than 95 million years ago. Newfound fossils demonstrate that the dinosaur's tail was well suited for swimming—bolstering the case that Spinosaurus spent much of its time in the water.Casablanca, MoroccoAt the end of a dim hallway in Casablanca’s Université Hassan II, I’ve walked into a dusty room containing a remarkable set of fossils—bones that raise foundational questions about Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, one of the weirdest dinosaurs ever discovered.Longer than an adult Tyrannosaurus rex, the 50-foot-long, seven-ton predator had a large sail on its back and an elongated snout that resembled the maw of a crocodile, bristling with conical teeth. For decades, reconstructions of its bulky body have ended in a long, narrowing tail like the ones on its many theropod cousins.The red-brown remains laid before me are altering that picture. These bones assemble into a mostly complete tail, the first yet found for Spinosaurus. It’s so large, five tables are required to support its full length, and to my shock, the appendage resembles a giant bony paddle.Shovels scrape and pickaxes fly as crew members chip away at Morocco’s Zrigat site, where paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim and his colleagues have been excavating a Spinosaurus skeleton.A Spinosaurus foot bone peeks out from red sandstone at the Moroccan dig site. The dinosaur fossil unearthed here is the most complete Cretaceous theropod ever found in North Africa.Described today in the journal Nature, this tail is the most extreme aquatic adaptation ever seen in a large dinosaur. Its discovery in Morocco stretches our understanding of how one of Earth’s most dominant groups of land animals lived and thrived.Delicate struts nearly two feet long jut from many of the vertebrae that make up the tail, giving it the profile of an oar. By the end of the tail, the bony bumps that help adjacent vertebrae interlock practically disappear, letting the tail’s tip undulate back and forth in a way that would propel the animal through water. The adaptation probably helped it move through the vast river ecosystem it called home—or even dart after the huge fish it likely preyed upon.“This was basically a dinosaur trying to build a fish tail,” says National Geographic Emerging Explorer Nizar Ibrahim, the lead researcher examining the fossil.The structure of the bones—along with state-of-the-art robotic modeling of the tail’s movement—add fresh and compelling evidence to an argument that has raged for years among paleontologists: How much time did Spinosaurus actually spend swimming, and, by implication, how close did large predatory dinosaurs ever get toward a life in the water? In 2014, researchers led by Ibrahim argued that the predator was the first confirmed semiaquatic dinosaur, a hypothesis that generated pushback from peers who questioned whether the fossil Ibrahim’s team were studying was actually Spinosaurus, or even a single individual.Samir Zouhri, a paleontologist at Université Hassan II, Casablanca, explores a site near Sidi Ali, Morocco, for more fossils from the time of Spinosaurus.By the time of Spinosaurus, 95 to 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous period, several groups of reptiles had evolved to live in marine environments, such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and the long-necked plesiosaurs. But those dino-era sea monsters sit on a different branch of the reptile family tree, while true dinosaurs like Spinosaurus have long been believed to be land dwellers.Now, with evidence from the newly analyzed tail, there’s a strong case that Spinosaurus didn’t merely flirt with the shore but was capable of full-fledged aquatic movement. Collectively, the findings published today suggest the giant Spinosaurus spent plenty of time underwater, perhaps hunting prey like a massive crocodile. “This tail is unambiguous,” says team member Samir Zouhri, a paleontologist at the Université Hassan II. “This dinosaur was swimming.”Other scientists who have evaluated the new study agree that the tail puts some lingering doubts to rest and strengthens the case of a semiaquatic Spinosaurus.“This is certainly a bit of a surprise,” says University of Maryland paleontologist Tom Holtz, who wasn’t involved with the study. “Spinosaurus is even weirder than we thought it was.”Team members Simone Maganuco, Nizar Ibrahim, and Cristiano Dal Sasso examine one of the Spinosaurus tail vertebrae. “To study a fossil animal is, to me, a sort of creation,” says Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at Italy’s Natural History Museum of Milan. “You have to resurrect an animal from fragments.”Long spines of bone protrude from the Spinosaurus tail vertebrae. In life, the projections increased the tail’s surface area and helped give it a paddle-like shape.The story of Spinosaurus is nearly as unusual as the newfound tail, an adventure that winds from bombed-out German museums to the Martian-like sandstone of the Moroccan Sahara.The remains of this odd animal first emerged from the depths of time more than a century ago, thanks to Bavarian paleontologist and aristocrat Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach. From 1910 to 1914, Stromer organized a series of expeditions to Egypt that yielded dozens of fossils, including pieces of what he would later name Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. In his first published description, Stromer struggled to explain the creature’s anatomy, speculating that its oddness “speaks for a certain specialization.” He envisioned the animal standing on its hind limbs like an off-balance T. rex, its long back bristling with spines. When the fossils went on display in Munich’s Paleontological Museum, they brought Stromer renown.Paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso gingerly holds the fourth vertebra from the base of Spinosaurus’s tail, one of the most complete vertebrae the team has recovered.During World War II, Allied bombing prompted Stromer—a critic of the Nazi regime—to beg the museum director to move the fossils to safety. The Nazi director refused, and bombing destroyed the fossils in 1944. Drawings, photos, and descriptions in journal articles were all that remained to prove Stromer’s Spinosaurus fossils ever existed.In the decades that followed, Spinosaurus took on a certain mythos, as generations of paleontologists found more of its close relatives across the world, from Brazil to Thailand, and tried to make sense of how they lived. Unearthed across four continents, these additional “spinosaurids” almost certainly ate fish based on their skull anatomy, tooth structures and, in one case, fish scales that were found preserved in a spinosaurid ribcage.In the early 20th century, paleontologists were toying with notions of aquatic dinosaurs, including one idea that large plant-eating dinosaurs lived in lagoons to help support their immense weight. But decades of anatomical research now show that dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes, even the titans among them, thrived on terra firma. The anatomy of other spinosaurids’ hind limbs strongly suggested that they, too, walked on land.Without a new Spinosaurus skeleton to examine, the species seemed destined to remain ambiguous.When Stromer tried to reconstruct Spinosaurus in the 1930s, he filled in the details with other theropod dinosaurs and gave it a now-outdated posture. Since 2014, a team led by Nizar Ibrahim has argued Spinosaurus was a seimaquatic predator, an idea the new tail strengthens.(See how paleontologists used the new Spinosaurus fossils to reconstruct a gigantic aquatic predator.)Clarity would come decades later from southeastern Morocco, where thousands of artisanal miners have scoured the region’s rocks and found fossils that span hundreds of millions of years of Earth’s history. Hoping to find dinosaur remains in particular, some diggers have focused their energies on the Kem Kem beds, a sandstone formation between 95 and 100 million years old that starts 200 miles east of Marrakesh and extends 150 miles to the southwest. The rocks preserve traces of what was once a vast river system where fish the size of cars once swam. If you spot an exposed patch of the Kem Kem beds’ red sandstone on the side of a butte, you’re liable to find the mouth of a tunnel too short to stand up in, carved by local miners with a sharpened piece of rebar.When miners come across fossils, they usually sell the bones to a web of wholesalers and exporters. This fossil mining industry provides vital income to thousands in this region, though it operates in a legal and ethical gray area. Locals dig year-round, making them almost certain to find more scientifically valuable specimens than academic paleontologists, who dig only a few weeks a year.That’s why paleontologists get to know local diggers and frequently check their hauls. An assistant professor at the University of Detroit Mercy, Ibrahim, who is of German and Moroccan descent, travels from village to village whenever he visits Morocco, discussing locals’ latest finds in Darija, the local Arabic dialect, over steaming glasses of fresh mint tea.Standing next to his satellite dish, a fossil collector displays some of his finds outside his home near Taouz, Morocco. The isolated bones offer a glimpse into the biodiversity of the Kem Kem ecosystem that Spinosaurus called home.Fossil-filled pastry boxes line the wall of a home near Taouz, Morocco, for visitors, researchers and would-be buyers to examine.On one such visit to a village outside the town of Erfoud in 2008, Ibrahim—by then a specialist in the Kem Kem beds—met a man who had found bones the scientist later realized might belong to a Spinosaurus. The encounter may as well have been fate. Ibrahim had loved Spinosaurus ever since he was a young boy growing up in Berlin.Ibrahim’s research partners at the Natural History Museum of Milan alerted him to even more bones from the same local miner in Italy and helped secure their return to Morocco. A second trip by Ibrahim, Zouhri, and University of Portsmouth paleontologist David Martill in 2013 at last led the team to the Kem Kem outcrop where the fossils originated, and they started finding more bone fragments.Ibrahim used these fresh fossils, previously found bones, and Stromer’s articles to attempt a fresh reconstruction of Spinosaurus. Their work, published in Science in 2014, declared the Moroccan fossils as a replacement for the original Egyptian ones lost in World War II bombings. Their reconstruction revealed the creature was 50 feet long when fully grown, longer than an adult T. rex.The study also argued that Spinosaurus had a slender torso, stubby hind limbs, a skull shaped like a fish-eating crocodile’s, and thick-walled bones similar to those in penguins and manatees—features that pointed to some kind of semiaquatic lifestyle.Samir Zouhri examines a large Spinosaurus tooth at a villager’s home in Taouz, Morocco. Paleontologists in the region build relationships with locals to make sure that scientifically important fossils make their way to the public trust.The study polarized paleontologists. Some reacted positively, convinced by the new data on Spinosaurus’s thick-walled bones. “That really sealed the deal for me,” says Lindsay Zanno, a North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences paleontologist who wasn’t part of Ibrahim’s research team. “Bone has memory,” she adds, noting that the microstructure of bone looks different in terrestrial animals, flying animals, or animals that spend most of their time in water.For other paleontologists, however, the evidence presented in 2014 didn’t clinch the case for an actively swimming Spinosaurus. Those researchers thought it likely that Spinosaurus, like other spinosaurids, ate fish by wading into the shallows like grizzly bears and herons. But based on the incomplete Moroccan remains, could researchers now say for certain that the prehistoric predator did more than its kin and quickly swam after aquatic prey? If so, how did it move through the water?Still others expressed doubt that the Moroccan bones belonged to a Spinosaurus. While the newfound Moroccan bones were clearly spinosaurid, the number of spinosaurid species in North Africa was, and is, a matter of scientific debate. Did the fossil’s anatomy exactly match Stromer’s lost Egyptian creature? Or did they instead belong to a close, but distinct, relative? “No one was particularly sure quite how many species or genera we’ve got [in North Africa], and quite where any one of them is in time and space,” says Dave Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London and a spinosaurid specialist.Seeking to put the controversy to rest, Ibrahim and his colleagues returned to the Moroccan site, with the support of the National Geographic Society, to check for more bones in September 2018. Time was of the essence: He had heard from local contacts that commercial fossil diggers were tunneling into nearby hills for bones. Ibrahim could not risk letting the rest of what he believed to be the world’s only known Spinosaurus skeleton vanish into collectors’ curio cabinets.Mohand Ihmadi, owner of Ihmadi Trilobites Center in Alnif, Morocco, prepares a Spinosaurus tooth for sale. For years, Ihmadi has saved the rarest fossils that pass through his shop in hopes of founding a museum. “It’s important we preserve our past,” he says. “If we lose it, we will never get it back.”The 2018 dig started brutally. To clear tons of sandstone, the crew bought the region’s only working jackhammer. It broke within minutes. Days were so grueling that several team members were hospitalized once they returned home. But the promise of discovery kept them going, along with Nutella breaks that temporarily took their minds off the punishing work. Finally, they started finding one caudal vertebra after another from the animal’s tail, sometimes just minutes and inches apart. The team was so giddy over the bonanza, they drummed out musical beats with their rock hammers and broke into song, belting out, “It’s another caudal!” to the tune of Europe’s “The Final Countdown.”I got a taste for the site’s challenges, and the rush of discovery, when I joined the team in July 2019 for a return expedition. The 117-degree heat and arid winds wicked liters of water from my body as we chipped our way through an outcrop marbled like bacon. Fanned along the outcrop below, Ibrahim’s Detroit Mercy students lugged rocks in buckets made from recycled tires and scoured the debris for even the tiniest flecks of bone.By the end of the next day, we’d found several Spinosaurus fossils, including foot bones and two dainty caudal vertebrae that would have formed the tip of the dinosaur’s tail. When the fruits of all this labor were at last laid out on tables back in the Casablanca lab, Ibrahim and his colleagues knew they had something truly remarkable.A statue of Triceratops, a species found in North America, looms outside the Tahiri Fossil Museum near Rissani, Morocco. Though Morocco has dinosaurs of its own, they are less well known than their distant American relatives.The Tahiri Fossil Museum, run by a fossil dealer, includes Moroccan remains and fossil casts from around the world. About half the space is devoted to a gift shop, where tourists can buy sliced-up pieces of dinosaur bone.By the end of 2018 alone, the dig team had uncovered more than 30 Spinosaurus tail vertebrae. Crucially, some of the tail bones neatly match up with illustrations of more fragmentary spinosaurid tail vertebrae that Stromer published in 1934, bolstering the case that a spinosaurid species living in Cretaceous North Africa ranged from Morocco to Egypt. In addition, Ibrahim and his team haven’t found any duplicate bones at the Moroccan site—a clear sign that the fossils belong to just one individual, an extremely unusual occurrence in the Kem Kem beds’ rough-and-tumble riverbeds.With the creature’s nearly complete tail now in hand, Ibrahim and his colleagues are more confident than ever that Spinosaurus was a swimmer—an assertion they’ve started putting to the test in the lab.In February 2019, Ibrahim contacted Stephanie Pierce, curator of vertebrate paleontology at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, with a question: Could she help him test how much thrust a dinosaur’s tail would generate in water? Though digitally modeling animal motion is one of her specialties, Pierce knew that answering the question required dynamic, real-world experiments. She and her colleague George Lauder, a fish biologist, agreed to join the team.Nearly six months after the Harvard duo joined Ibrahim’s team, I walked into Lauder’s lab, a room whirring with ventilation and the fans of overworked computers. Lauder, sitting at a workbench, reached for an orange plastic sheet—the laser-cut outline of a Spinosaurus tail—and attached it to a metal rod. He then walked across the lab to what looked like an elaborately built fish tank and mounted the tail inside a tangle of metal beams hanging from the ceiling.With new bones come new models: Guzun Ion of DI.MA. Dino Makers, a museum sculpture firm in Fossalta di Piave, Italy, molds an updated version of the tail for a life-size Spinosaurus sculpture.The device is a robot called the “Flapper,” which dangles beneath a water flume whose flow speed Lauder can control with exquisite precision. Studded with lights, cameras, and sensors, the ensemble can precisely track the aquatic movements of a swimming animal or a swimming robot—and the forces they impart as they move.As I watched, Lauder lowered the Flapper into the water, and the plastic model Spinosaurus tail attached to it sprang to life with a motion meant to mimic a swimming alligator. With each flap, a shadow rushed across the tail—and data streamed into Lauder’s computers. The Flapper recorded the forces imparted by the tail, reflecting how well it would have propelled Spinosaurus through water.Pierce and Lauder’s results, which are included in the Nature paper, show that the tail of Spinosaurus delivers more than eight times the forward thrust in water than the tails of the non-spinosaurid theropods Coelophysis and Allosaurus—and does so twice as efficiently. The finding suggests the giant Spinosaurus spent plenty of time submerged, possibly navigating rivers like a modern crocodile but on a massive scale.That conclusion sets Spinosaurus apart from other water-loving dinosaurs described since 2014, including species that may have lived like geese or turtles. The more Lauder talks about a paddle on the rear of a predator up to 50 feet long, the more his eyes widen at the unprecedented nature of the discovery. “It’s unbelievable!” he says.In future experiments, Pierce and Lauder say that a modified version of the Flapper trials could test a 3D model of the tail, or even a full-body model of the updated Spinosaurus, which would help clarify how the dinosaur’s six-foot-tall dorsal sail affected its swimming. To achieve that dream, though, Ibrahim wants to incorporate every last scrap of bone he can, which is why his team returned to the desert in the height of summer 2019 for more digging.Some of the fossils I saw them find on that expedition will soon help test another aquatic feature of Spinosaurus: its possibly webbed feet. With more bones in hand, researchers can finally reconstruct the dinosaur’s whole foot to help test how widely Spinosaurus splayed its toes.Crucially for Ibrahim, any fossils the team finds remain in Morocco, growing the collection that Zouhri, the Université Hassan II paleontologist, oversees in his Casablanca lab. The hope is that someday, these bones and the scientists studying them will seed Morocco’s first national museum of natural history—and inspire people across North Africa to dream of the lost worlds beneath their feet.“What I want to do is build a home for Spinosaurus,” Ibrahim says. “This is going to become a symbol—an icon—of African paleontology.”",
"Before 2014, paleontologists had only a handful of fossils from the tail of Spinosaurus. They theorized that its tail, like that of other theropods, was primarily used to balance the forward-leaning center of gravity and was most likely rigid. They thought the tail was also a secondary means of aquatic propulsion, adding thrust to the movement of the limbs as it crawled and waded in the shallows. (Read about how the bizarre Spinosaurus makes history as first known swimming dinosaur.)Excavations in 2018 in Morocco found 131 additional bone fragments, including 36 vertebrae, fundamentally changing our understanding of the Spinosaurus tail.The latest find paints a much clearer picture of the tail. It is far more elongated vertically and less rigid than once thought, indicating that the tail was a powerful source of thrust in the water.Studies of the tail show that it had up to eight times as much thrust as other theropod tails, allowing it to swim against currents and accelerate to capture prey.North Africa 95 million years ago had rich river systems. Ernst Stromer found the first Spinosaurus specimen in Egypt in 1912; the latest finds have been located in Morocco.The first ideas of how Spinosaurus looked were informed by a limited fossil record and a narrow understanding of dinosaurs in general. Further finds have added to our concept of what Spinosaurus looked like, leading us to the aquatic predator we now see.",
"At the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago, a giant asteroid impact at Chicxulub off the coast of Mexico led to darkened skies and global cooling, killing off all the dinosaurs save birds.On the last day of the Cretaceous period, a 7.5-mile-wide asteroid slammed into Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula and changed the arc of life on Earth. Sixty-six million years later, scientists have used supercomputers to re-create the devastation of that infamous impact in unprecedented detail. The models are helping to solve a longstanding mystery about what killed off all dinosaurs except birds and offering a new glimpse at how life on Earth responds to rapid environmental change.Scientists already knew that the extraterrestrial impactor blew a crater roughly 120 miles wide into Earth’s crust, hitting in just the right spot—and at just the right angle—to fling colossal amounts of cooling gases and soot into the upper atmosphere. Skies blackened as massive tsunamis tore across the oceans, and wildfires raged for hundreds of miles around. Within years, temperatures plummeted more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, plunging the world into a prolonged cold period known as an impact winter that scientists believe killed off more than three-quarters of life on Earth. (Find out more on how the dinosaurs went extinct.)The event was like “Dante’s Inferno on Earth,” says Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a research associate at University College London, and leader of a new study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Around the same time the asteroid struck—known as the Chicxulub impact—a large volcanic complex in what’s now Southern India was erupting, releasing more than 200,000 cubic miles of lava and pumping climate-altering gases into the sky. While most scientists agree that the asteroid triggered the extinction event, researchers have long wondered whether these volcanoes, called the Deccan Traps, also contributed to the devastation of life.In the new study, Chiarenza and his colleagues use models to re-create Earth’s ancient climate, tweaking the variables of various apocalyptic scenarios. These simulations reveal that the asteroid alone rendered the planet uninhabitable for all dinosaurs other than birds. Perhaps counterintuitively, the volcanoes of the Deccan Traps may have actually made Earth more hospitable, not less.“This is, I would think, a nail in the coffin [for the hypothesis that] the Deccan Traps drove the mass extinction,” says paleontologist Anjali Goswami, a research leader at the Natural History Museum, London, who wasn’t involved with the study.Named for the two geologic periods on either side of the event, the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction happened with remarkable speed. Intense cold, constant darkness, wildfires, tsunamis, unbearable heat in the impact area, and eventual acid rain mangled the planet. The sudden destruction caused by the extinction event presents an opportunity for today’s scientists to study how life may respond to rapid, severe stresses.“It gives us an idea of what organisms do when someone pulls the rug out from under them,” says Yale University paleontologist Pincelli Hull, an expert on the extinction of the dinosaurs.To truly understand how the mass dinosaur extinction played out, though, scientists need to agree on what, exactly, caused it.In the last decade, geologists have confirmed that the Deccan Traps erupted in several pulses over 700,000 years, a period that overlaps with the Chicxulub impact. Because the volcanoes were erupting during the extinction event, scientists have wondered if they played a part in killing the animals. Two of the five biggest mass extinctions were caused by severe warming from volcanic carbon dioxide, including the worst of all: The Permian-Triassic mass extinction 252 million years ago, triggered by ancient eruptions in what’s now Siberia, wiped out 96 percent of marine life and about three of every four species on land.The Deccan Traps could have affected life 66 million years ago in two major ways. On shorter timescales, sulfur dioxide released by the volcanoes could have cooled the planet and fostered acid rain, throwing Earth’s oceans—and broader chemical cycles—into disarray. Over time, the vast amount of CO2 released in the eruptions could have led to steady warming, potentially stressing global ecosystems.Two efforts published last year that tried to date the biggest pulse of eruptions from the Deccan Traps disagree by tens of thousands of years—a difference between the biggest eruptions occurring before the asteroid impact, when they could have affected the die-offs, or a short time after, when they would have played no role in driving the extinction.To put the disasters to the test, Chiarenza and his colleague Alexander Farnsworth, a climatologist at the University of Bristol, built computer models of Earth’s climate as it was 66 million years ago. They ran 14 different scenarios that included the asteroid impact, the Deccan Traps, and the two events combined. The simulations assumed CO2 levels of between 560 and 1,680 parts per million—as much as four times higher than today. The scientists also dimmed the virtual sunlight by between 5 percent and 20 percent from pre-impact levels.In some of the simulations, Chiarenza and Farnsworth also modeled the Chicxulub impact’s short-term cooling effects by injecting a hundred times more ash and aerosols than the Mount Pinatubo eruption that rocked the Philippines in 1991. To track how the disasters affected dinosaurs, Chiarenza mapped out the ancient animals’ likeliest habitats with another computer model based on ancient climate data and dinosaur fossil locations.All of the models showed the Deccan Traps could not have caused dinosaur die-outs. The long-term warming the volcanoes caused wouldn’t have eliminated the dinosaurs; if anything, it expanded the land area they could comfortably inhabit. Even the most extreme dimming scenario from the Deccan Traps didn’t wipe out dinosaurs’ ecological niche, the new study shows.The asteroid impact scenarios, however, were downright horrific. In some, average land temperatures plummeted from more than 68°F (20°C) to well below zero, and precipitation declined by between 85 percent and 95 percent. When the virtual Chicxulub impact dimmed sunlight by 15 percent or more, no habitat anywhere on Earth could support non-avian dinosaurs. (Find out more about how birds survived the mass extinction.)Looking at the new data, “it becomes quite reasonable why some things went extinct,” Goswami says. “Actually, it becomes amazing that everything didn’t.”The research team’s models also revealed something unexpected: The Deccan Traps may have actually helped life recover, as the volcanoes’ CO2 emissions blunted the impact winter’s severity.“That’s a great plot twist,” Hull says. “I don’t think anyone was thinking about volcanism making the impact less bad. That’s truly surprising.”Recent work suggests the Deccan Traps likely erupted in a trickle of activity over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than dealing a sharp global blow to ecosystems. Last November, a group led by Hull found that Earth’s oceans rapidly acidified in the tens of thousands of years after Chicxulub—likely from post-impact acid rain—but ocean pH levels were stable during the 100,000 years or so before the impact, even while the Deccan Traps were already erupting.In a follow-up study, Hull showed that in the 300,000 years before the impact, global temperatures gradually rose and fell by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit, indicative of rising and falling CO2 levels, but nothing so extreme that it would threaten the dinosaurs.There are also signs far from the lava flows in India that hint at the Deccan Traps’ role in facilitating life’s recovery. Last October, a group led by Tyler Lyson, a paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, unveiled several sites in the Rocky Mountains that record North America’s post-asteroid flora and fauna. Lyson’s team found that for 100,000 years after the impact, ecosystems didn’t have many types of life—but then, mammal and plant diversity blossomed in pulses that correlate with mild warming periods, consistent with CO2 spurts that the Deccan Traps could have given off.The recent studies, Lyson says, have led to a captivating idea: “Deccan as the creator, versus Deccan as the destroyer.”",
"As a hatchling, the dinosaur Mussaurus patagonicus walked on all fours. But as the dinosaur grew, its center of mass changed and it shifted to two-legged locomotion.It’s a special moment when a baby learns how to go from crawling on all fours to walking on two legs, especially considering how rare this transition is in the animal kingdom. Only a few other species are thought to make the shift from crawling to upright walking as they age—and they’re all dinosaurs.Now, researchers have added compelling new evidence for one member on that list: a sauropod named Mussaurus patagonicus. (Also see fossil footprints from sauropods that lived in what’s now Scotland.)A baby Mussaurus patagonicus was small enough to fit in human hands.When Mussaurus hatched, it would have been small enough to fit cozily inside a human hand, earning it a genus name that means “mouse lizard.” But after just eight years of gobbling up ferns and other plants, the same creature would have weighed more than a ton.This dramatic explosion in body size and shape brought with it a shift in the way the animal moved, scientists argue in a new study published today in the journal Scientific Reports.Using a remarkable series of nearly complete fossils that depict three key stages of life, the scientists were able to create interactive 3-D models of the early Jurassic dinosaur and work out where its center of body mass would have been as it aged. Early in life, the animal’s large head and neck would have tilted its body forward onto the support of well-developed forearms. But as its tail grew, the center of gravity would have shifted to the pelvic region, drawing the animal upward into a stance that allowed for walking on two legs.“We don’t know if this pattern applied to all sauropods,” says study leader Alejandro Otero, a paleontologist at the La Plata Museum in Argentina. “But the fact that this [group of animals] shifted their movements in a way so similar to humans is fascinating.”One of the things that makes studying extinct animals so difficult is that scientists can usually only see a tiny snapshot of each creature’s life. Often, that snapshot does not include hatchlings or juveniles, which are smaller and less likely to fossilize. (Find out how fossil eggs are revealing more about dinosaur parenting styles.)“There are few dinosaurs for which we have a good series from eggs or babies to adults, and Mussaurus has become one of those, which opens up some exciting new questions not feasible 20 years ago,” says study coauthor John Hutchinson, a professor of evolutionary biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London.It’s taken over half a century to assemble the set of fossils that informed the current study, for instance. Scientists call these ontogenetic series, and they are highly prized.“We typically think of each species of dinosaur represented by one monolithic entity, but like every other animal, they have a growth series that we usually just don't get a chance to see, since dinosaur fossils are so rare,” says Shaena Montanari, a paleontologist and AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow who was not involved in the study.Mussaurus is just one branch on the dinosaur family tree that may have switched locomotion modes as the animals aged.“Several dinosaurs have been hypothesized to do it, including Maiasaura, Iguanodon, Psittacosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Massospondylus,” says Kimi Chapelle, a Ph.D. candidate studying locomotion shifts in dinosaurs at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.Paleontologists have what's known as an ontogenetic series for Mussaurus patagonicus, a set of nearly complete fossils that depict three key stages of life, including this juvenile skull.What’s more, some species displayed shifts in the opposite direction, going from walking on two legs to walking on four, says Chapelle, who was not part of the new study. A propensity for switching things up is even reflected in dinosaur evolution.“Ancestral dinosaurs are bipedal, but quadrupedality evolved independently across two major lineages,” Chapelle says. That includes the Ornithischia branch, which produced many famous quadruped dinosaurs, such as Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and Ankylosaurus. (See a stunning ankylosaur fossil found by accident in a Canadian mine.)Despite all this shifting around among dinosaurs, the scientists had a really difficult time finding an example of such behavior in living animals.“Humans ended up being the best and probably the only really well-known example,” says study coauthor Andrew Cuff, a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London. “It’s a really rare thing to see, which is why it’s so exciting to see it in the fossil record of this species.”",
"The Jurassic period (199.6 million to 145.5 million years ago) was characterized by a warm, wet climate that gave rise to lush vegetation and abundant life. Many new dinosaurs emerged—in great numbers. Among them were stegosaurs, brachiosaurs, allosaurs, and many others.Dinosaurs, birds, and rodents. Crumbling landmasses and inland seas. Sea monsters, sharks, and blood-red plankton. Forests of ferns, cycads, and conifers. Warm, moist, tropical breezes. This was the Jurassic, which took place 199 to 145 million years ago.At the start of the period, the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea continued and accelerated. Laurasia, the northern half, broke up into North America and Eurasia. Gondwana, the southern half, began to break up by the mid-Jurassic. The eastern portion—Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and Australia—split from the western half, Africa and South America. New oceans flooded the spaces in between. Mountains rose on the seafloor, pushing sea levels higher and onto the continents.All this water gave the previously hot and dry climate a humid and drippy subtropical feel. Dry deserts slowly took on a greener hue. Palm tree-like cycads were abundant, as were conifers such as araucaria and pines. Ginkgoes carpeted the mid- to high northern latitudes, and podocarps, a type of conifer, were particularly successful south of the Equator. Tree ferns were also present.The oceans, especially the newly formed shallow interior seas, teemed with diverse and abundant life. At the top of the food chain were the long-necked and paddle-finned plesiosaurs, giant marine crocodiles, sharks, and rays. Fishlike ichthyosaurs, squidlike cephalopods, and coil-shelled ammonites were abundant. Coral reefs grew in the warm waters, and sponges, snails, and mollusks flourished. Microscopic, free-floating plankton proliferated and may have turned parts of the ocean red.On land, dinosaurs were making their mark in a big way—literally. The plant-eating sauropod Brachiosaurus stood up to 52 feet (16 meters) tall, stretched some 85 feet (26 meters) long, and weighed more than 80 tons. Diplodocus, another sauropod, was 90 feet (27 meters) long. These dinosaurs' sheer size may have deterred attack from Allosaurus, a bulky, meat-eating dinosaur that walked on two powerful legs. But Allosaurus and other fleet-footed carnivores, such as the coelurosaurs, must have had occasional success. Other prey included the heavily armored stegosaurs.The earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx, took to the skies in the late Jurassic, most likely evolved from an early coelurosaurian dinosaur. Archaeopteryx had to compete for airspace with pterosaurs, flying reptiles that had been buzzing the skies since the late Triassic. Meanwhile, insects such as leafhoppers and beetles were abundant, and many of Earth's earliest mammals scurried around dinosaur feet—ignorant that their kind would come to dominate Earth once the dinosaurs were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous.",
"This fossilized egg was laid by Mussaurus, a long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur that grew to 20 feet in length and lived between 227 and 208.5 million years ago in what is now Argentina.A global search from the deserts of Mongolia to the highlands of Argentina has revealed the first soft-shelled dinosaur eggs ever discovered, providing a new glimpse into how dinosaurs laid their eggs and parented their young. The emerging picture is that, reproductively speaking, the earliest dinosaurs were like modern reptiles, which generally bury their eggs in nests or burrows and don’t stick around to tend them.The revelation comes from two teams of international researchers, who have presented stunning new fossils of ancient soft-shelled eggs as old as 200 million years. One group describes the first soft eggshells ever identified among dinosaurs, while the other presents the first fossil egg ever discovered in Antarctica—possibly from a marine reptile—which also seems to have had a soft shell.The fossils’ mere existence, let alone the quality of their preservation, has left scientists astounded. “How does the saying go: There’s more things on heaven and Earth than we’ve ever imagined?” says Julia Clarke, a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin and a coauthor of one of the two studies, both unveiled in today in the journal Nature.Past dinosaur egg discoveries going back decades featured hard eggshells like those laid by modern birds, dinosaurs’ only living descendants. Bird eggshells contain a layer of the mineral calcite, which makes them stronger and harder, allowing birds to sit on their eggs, or brood, to incubate them. As such, paleontologists most often imagined dinosaurs using similar parenting strategies. But these eggs almost always were dated to the Cretaceous period, late in dinosaur evolution. Now, the mystery of the missing earlier eggs may have an explanation: In all likelihood, they were soft and leathery, which made them more likely to degrade and not fossilize.Taken together, the new studies add substantially to what scientists know about dinosaur and ancient reptile reproduction.“There’s more to the fossil record than just skeletal remains,” says Johan Lindgren, a paleontologist at Sweden’s Lund University who reviewed both studies and analyzes fossilized soft tissues, including an ancient marine reptile’s blubber. “Occasionally, you find much more than that.”Some of the fossil clues used in the two studies were stashed in the office cabinets of American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Mark Norell—where he keeps high-priority specimens. “They’re the most unthinkably amazing fossils on the planet,” says Yale Ph.D. student Jasmina Wiemann, who likens them to “a sneak peek into the next 10 years in paleontology.”Wiemann and Matteo Fabbri, another doctoral candidate at Yale, regularly visit Norell in New York to see the fossils he studies. Among this ancient collection, Norell showed Wiemann and Fabbri a clutch of a dozen dinosaur embryos more than 72 million years old that he and his Mongolian colleagues found during a 1995 expedition to the Gobi desert. Mysteriously, the embryos, which belonged to the early horned dinosaur Protoceratops, were encircled by black-and-white films rather than any kind of identifiable hard eggshell.In 1995, paleontologists working in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia found this clutch of fossilized Protoceratops eggs and embryos, the first eggs of a horned dinosaur ever described.“Mark showed us this clutch and went, You know, I really think they lay soft eggshells—he just threw it out like this,” Wiemann says. “At first we thought, Probably not. But looking more closely at the fossils, we realized there were these super-weird haloes.”If Protoceratops laid soft eggs, it’d be the first dinosaur ever found with them, upending years of previous assumptions. Soft eggshells had been discovered for other ancient animals, such as dinosaurs’ distant ancestors and extinct flying reptiles called pterosaurs, but not within the clade of Dinosauria itself.The team took small samples of the fossils and sliced them thin enough to examine under a microscope. The cross-section revealed that the “haloes” were about a third of a millimeter thick and lacked the standard calcified structure of later dinosaur eggs. “One of the striking, striking things was that there were no eggshells,” Fabbri says.Meanwhile, in what is now the Patagonian region of Argentina, a team of researchers set out in 2012 and 2013 on expeditions funded by the National Geographic Society to search for fossils of a plant-eating dinosaur named Mussaurus that lived more than 200 million years ago.The expedition found Mussaurus specimens so early in their development, they must have been embryos—but the team was surprised when they couldn’t find hard, calcified eggshells along with the remains. “We could never get it right,” says National Geographic Explorer Diego Pol, a paleontologist at Argentina’s Egidio Feruglio Paleontology Museum. “We were asking the wrong question. We were looking for the wrong thing.”One day, Pol spoke with Norell, his former Ph.D. adviser, and the two realized that the dinosaur embryos from Mongolia and Argentina shared an unusual lack of calcified eggshells. Pol quickly sent samples to Wiemann and Fabbri at Yale, who took a closer look at the Mussaurus remains.  By shining a laser at the samples and analyzing the light that scattered back, Wiemann deduced the chemical signatures of the ancient Protoceratops and Mussaurus eggs, as well as the composition of eggs from modern birds, alligators, turtles, and other reptiles. Chemical data from the dinosaur eggs most closely resembled that from other soft eggshells.Soft eggs don’t retain water as well as hard eggs, which means that Protoceratops and Mussaurus probably buried their eggs like modern turtles or alligators, possibly standing guard for a time or perhaps moving on. The dinosaur lineages with hard eggshells pursued several different nesting strategies, including burying their eggs. But one group of dinosaurs with hard-shelled eggs, the theropods that later begat birds, had open-air nests they brooded—a much more involved form of parenting.To trace the evolution of dinosaur eggs, Fabbri plotted a family tree back to roughly 250 million years ago and found that the common ancestor of all dinosaurs most likely laid soft eggs. The work suggests that calcified eggshells didn’t evolve once among dinosaurs, as previously thought, but at least three different times. Suddenly, the researchers say, the wide diversity of dinosaurs’ hard eggshells has an explanation.“Everything is starting to tie together really nicely,” Wiemann says.Farther south, in the rocks of Antarctica, another egg has captivated scientists—the second largest fossilized egg ever found, measuring nearly a foot long.The 68-million-year-old egg, called Antarcticoolithus bradyi, is the first fossil egg ever found in Antarctica, only outsized by the eggs of Madagascar’s extinct elephant bird. Antarcticoolithus is also one of the few fossil eggs ever found in marine sediment. “For the first egg remnant from Antarctica to be a nearly complete egg that has finely preserved microstructure is kind of insane,” says Julia Clarke of UT Austin.Antarcticoolithus was discovered in 2011 by a team of Chilean researchers on an expedition to Antarctica’s Seymour Island. The bizarre, deflated lump mystified the team. When study coauthor David Rubilar-Rogers, a paleontologist at Chile’s National Museum of Natural History, introduced the fossil to Clarke in 2018, he called it “The Thing.”From the side, the giant fossil egg Antarcticoolithus bradyi looks like a deflated NFL football. Officially, its species name bradyi, derived from the ancient Greek for "delayed," refers to the rarity of marine egg fossils. However, the name also pays winking tribute to NFL quarterback Tom Brady.Under a microscope, Antarcticoolithus not only lacked the internal structure of hard eggshells, but also the pores of hard-shelled eggs, suggesting the large egg was soft.At the time the egg was laid, large marine reptiles called mosasaurs lived in the Antarctic waters where the fossil egg was entombed. The bones of a mosasaur were found less than 700 feet from the site, suggesting the egg may have belonged to these 20-foot-long swimming reptiles.This illustration depicts the hypothesis that Antarcticoolithus was laid by a mosasaur, a type of extinct marine reptile. Mother mosasaurs would have laid thin, soft-shelled eggs that their babies immediately hatched from to surface and take their first breaths.However, the egg doesn’t have any bones inside, so nobody knows the parent’s identity for sure. Other ancient marine reptiles are known to have given live birth like modern whales. If mosasaurs did lay eggs, their babies would have had to hatch immediately to surface and take their first breaths.Could Antarcticoolithus have come from a dinosaur? If it did, the large egg was almost certainly laid on land and then washed out to sea. “Hopefully, if they excavate that area more, they will find embryos associated with similar eggs, and then we would know,” Lindgren says. (Read about Spinosaurus, the first known swimming dinosaur.)These prehistoric eggs collected from around the world underscore how much scientists have yet to learn about reptile evolution, particularly among dinosaurs, whose earliest members buried their eggs like many modern reptiles, as well as their distant reptilian ancestors from more than 250 million years ago.“We thought about dinosaurs as special reptiles for all this time ... At least in their beginning, they were not so special,” Fabbri says. “We are overturning what we were assuming for decades.”",
"Germany's Holzmaden shale quarries have yielded many 180-million-year-old marine fossils, including thousands of dolphin-like reptiles called ichthyosaurs, such as this juvenile Stenopterygius. Now, researchers analyzing a different Stenopterygius specimen from Holzmaden have found fossilized blubber, a first.Some 180 million years ago in what's now Germany, a dolphin-like reptile died and sank to the bottom of an ancient ocean. Remarkably, the creature's burial at sea preserved its body in stunning detail—including the first chemical clues that suggest these prehistoric animals had whale-like blubber.The fossil, unveiled on December 5 in the journal Nature, preserves the body of a Stenopterygius, a type of marine reptile called an ichthyosaur that lived during the early Jurassic period. The animal's skin still bears folds and ripples, as well as cells that held some of the animal's pigmentation and the chemical traces of blubber. Controversially, researchers also claim that the remains still have vestiges of their original proteins.“Not only can you look at these structures and identify them at the cellular level, there's traces of the original protein in there—this is the tip of the iceberg, into Jurassic Park-type stuff,” says study coauthor Benjamin Kear, a paleontologist at Uppsala University.The research marks the latest effort by paleontologists to glean huge insights from fossils' smallest scales.“This study really delves into the preservation of this animal in its entirety ... at a scale that has only become possible over the last few decades,” Virginia Tech paleontologist Caitlin Colleary, an expert on molecular preservation in fossils, writes in an email. “This study is another example of how molecular paleontology can help us to reimagine what these animals looked like when they were alive.”Before dinosaurs were even named by science, ichthyosaurs—literally “fish lizards”—captured the imaginations of 19th-century natural philosophers. With leathery skin, slender jaws, and bodies built for speed, the reptiles were the dolphin of the Mesozoic era, the time of dinosaurs. Today, the creatures are understood as evolutionary trendsetters.“They came from lung-breathing reptiles on land, and pretty quickly became fish-shaped after 30 million years. Ichthyosaurs are the first; whales did it later,” says Ryosuke Motani, a paleontologist at the University of California, Davis, who studies ichthyosaurs. “They [also] have the largest eyes of all vertebrates, and some later species had the highest number of fingers: nine to 10 in one hand.” (At 85 feet long, an ichtyosaur found in the U.K. may be the largest that ever lived.)Photographic (top) and diagrammatic (bottom) representations show details of the Stenopterygius examined in the new study. The animal's skull lies to the left.For more than a century, people have found ichthyosaur fossils with traces of soft tissue, a consequence of the animals' deep-sea burials in low-oxygen sediments. The best-known of these fossils come from the shale quarries of Holzmaden, Germany. Many of the quarry's ichthyosaurs bear blackish outlines, which trace the animals' skin and fins.Since the 1930s, researchers studying these outlines have suspected that ichthyosaurs had blubber, Motani says. In ichthyosaur fossils with body outlines, there's always a gap between the backbone and the ichthyosaur's upper surface—suggestive of ample soft tissue padding the animal's frame.The challenge came in proving the blubber hunch with chemical evidence. Could researchers be sure that the outlines preserved the ichthyosaur itself, or simply the mats of bacteria that had feasted on the corpse? Did the fossil preserve hints of the animal's original fats and proteins? To find out, researchers needed to study the chemistry of an ichthyosaur in detail. But to prepare fossils, museums often carefully remove surrounding rock or treat them with stabilizing compounds, which could introduce contamination.That's when Lund University paleontologist Johan Lindgren decided to source an uncontaminated ichthyosaur and then throw as many different chemical analyses at it as possible. Holzmaden's Urweltmuseum Hauff, which holds many of the site's fossils, happened to have a Stenopterygius specimen that fit the bill. Soon, 23 international researchers joined Lindgren's team.“It really was an Alice-in-Wonderland kind of story,” Kear says. “We went down the rabbit hole, and it got deeper and deeper.”First, Lindgren's team analyzed the ichthyosaur's skin, which the fossil preserved in astounding detail. Researchers could make out the skin's individual layers and even the folds that formed as the animal decayed.Strikingly, the researchers found traces of melanophores, specialized cells that contain the pigment melanin. While such a find dates back to the 1950s in ichthyosaurs, Lindgren's team took a decidedly 21st-century approach. Using high-powered spectroscopes and x-rays, researchers scanned the fossil for melanin and reconstructed the melanophores in 3-D. The team found that, like many marine animals today, the ichthyosaur's back was darker in color than its belly. This form of coloration, called countershading, would have helped the animal disguise itself in the water and regulate its body temperature.Researchers also saw hints of blubber within the preserved skin. Chemical tests suggest that the layer isn't a modern contaminant or protein-based like the other skin layers. Instead, it's a yellowish, fatty band, approximately where dolphins and leatherback turtles have blubber today.An illustration shows the ichthyosaur Stenopterygius as it may have appeared in life. Researchers don't know the animal's precise color or patterning, but fossil evidence suggests that its back was darker in color than its belly.“To me, it looks quite convincing,” says Yale paleontologist Jasmina Wiemann, a Ph.D. student and expert on fossils' molecular preservation who was not involved with the study. “They did lots of methods, I have to say, it looks like a lot of work.”At a minimum, the presence of blubber implies that ichthyosaurs could maintain a steady body temperature. While not conclusive evidence for warm-bloodedness like that in modern mammals—including whales and dolphins—the find jibes with a 2010 study that found that ichthyosaurs' body temperatures reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit.Perhaps the study's biggest and most contentious claim is that the ichthyosaur fossils still contain some of the animal's original proteins. If so, the ichthyosaur would have some of the oldest preserved biomolecules ever found, at approximately 180 million years old.North Carolina State University paleontologist Mary Schweitzer, a coauthor on the paper, helped the team sniff out fossil proteins using antibodies. She has used this technique for decades, finding evidence of dinosaur collagen and other proteins under rigorous clean-room conditions. In this case, Schweitzer and her colleagues saw signs of hemoglobin in the ichthyosaur's liver, as well as hints of structural proteins such as collagen and keratin in the skin.Her team analyzed the samples in a lab where modern animal tissues are forbidden. To further protect against false positives, they also screened their samples with multiple antibodies, including one that would highlight fossilized bacterial mats if they were present.“We can differentiate where these antibodies bind, and they don't bind randomly,” Schweitzer says. “You don't see keratin [antibodies] binding everything; it only binds in what we interpret as skin.”But some paleontologists have long criticized the antibody method as one prone to showing proteins that aren't really there. Recently, researchers reanalyzed one of Schweitzer's first published samples—fibers from the dinosaur fossil Shuvuuia deserti—with several methods. They found no evidence of proteins.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.“I am worried that these antibody techniques are highly susceptible to false positives from consolidants [compounds used to stabilize fossils], contaminants, and other fossil organics,” Evan Saitta, the researcher at the Field Museum of Natural History who led the Shuvuuia reanalysis, writes in an email. “I would like these studies to include more control samples ... although the heterogenous nature of this sample might help to sort some of this out.”The skepticism stems in part from the magnitude of Schweitzer and others' claims. If proteins really do preserve that well in the fossil record, researchers could directly study ancient animals' proteins and learn much more about how the creatures lived and evolved than bones alone can reveal. Future work on other ichthyosaurs, as well as more analysis of this study's Stenopterygius, should help clarify the matter.“We're absolutely going to continue [studying this fossil],” Schweitzer says. “It's an amazing specimen.”In the meantime, Kear welcomes the debate the team's study may provoke: “Bring it on!” he says. “It's only through this constant testing of the data that we're going to have any close idea of what's actually going on.”",
"The explosion of animal diversity really kicked off during the Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago.The first animals that lived on Earth roamed the seas. The oceans were ruled by jawless, mostly spineless creatures that look alien compared with modern ocean life. The earliest animals with backbones, the vertebrates, were around in the Cambrian, but they did not diversify extensively until the Silurian period, just over 420 million years ago.The oceans then became overrun with a vast array of bony fish, while arthropods and insects were making their way onto land. In the Devonian period, around 400 million years ago, four-legged fish crawled out of the sea to become the ancestors of all vertebrate life on land—including humans.Once on land, animals expanded into an assortment of shapes designed for running, flying, hopping, and crawling. The rise of dinosaurs kicked off during the Triassic period, around 230 million years ago. Pterosaurs, flying reptiles, took to the skies around the same time and became the earliest known vertebrates capable of powered flight.Even while dinosaurs dominated the landscape, small rat-like mammals were becoming more common. They survived the mass extinction 65 million years ago that ended the Age of Dinosaurs, along with some birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Most major animal groups that survived this extinction event still exist today.",
"The largest birds that ever lived—the now-extinct elephant birds—looked a lot like super-sized ostriches. They were fast-running and flightless, just like ostriches are. And their island home of Madagascar was just a short distance from mainland Africa, where ostriches live.If you had to put money on the identity of the elephant birds’ closest living relative, the ostrich would be a safe bet. It would also be a spectacularly wrong one.Elephant birds have been extinct for centuries, but many of their skeletons reside in museums around the world. By extracting DNA from these specimens and comparing it to DNA from living birds, Kieren Mitchell from the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA has discovered that the elephant birds’ closest living relative is… the kiwi.“That blew us away completely,” says Alan Cooper, who led the study. “You have to try pretty hard to get a more disparate pair.”He’s not exaggerating. Elephant birds probably plucked fruit from trees, while kiwis rummage through leaf litter for grubs and worms. Elephant birds lived in Madagascar, around 7,000 miles away from the kiwi’s home in New Zealand. The biggest elephant birds great up to 3 metres tall and weighed up to 275 kilograms; kiwis would bump against your shins and smaller species could fit inside an elephant bird’s gargantuan egg.“Geographically, it didn’t make any sense. Morphologically, it didn’t make sense. Ecologically, it didn’t make any sense,” says Cooper. “We tested it pretty exhaustively because we were so surprised, but there’s no doubt in the genetic data.”All the scientists I contacted agreed that the result is surprising. But it actually fits with a new narrative about the origin of ostriches, kiwis and their kin, which has been gaining support over the last few decades.The elephant bird and kiwi belong to a group of birds called the ratites. These include the ostrich from Africa, the rhea from South America, the emu and cassowary from Australia, and the extinct moas of New Zealand.Kiwis aside, these species are all big and flightless. Many scientists (quite reasonably) assumed that evolved from a common ancestor that was itself already big and flightless. This ancestral ratite probably lived at a time when all the southern continents were fused into a single land mass called Gondwana, and diverged into separate forms when the super-continent broke apart.This ‘rafting’ story seems intuitive but it has crumbled in the face of genetic evidence.As scientists compared ratite DNA, they found that geographical neighbours aren’t necessarily evolutionary neighbours. The moas and kiwis, for example, both hail from New Zealand. But when Cooper sequenced moa DNA in 1992, he found that kiwis are closer to the Australian emus and cassowaries than to their island neighbours. These birds arose after Australia and New Zealand had split so if they all evolved from an already flightless ancestor, the kiwis must have somehow rafted over a huge stretch of Pacific.The ratites aren’t all flightless either. Genetic studies revealed that a group of flying, South American birds called tinamous are part of the ratite group. Stranger still, the closest relatives of the small, partridge-like tinamous are the huge, towering moas—a fact that Allan Baker from the Royal Ontario Museum confirmed earlier this month.Cooper’s discovery mirrors the moa-tinamou relationship. Two groups of giant birds (moas and elephant birds) are more closely related to small, chicken-sized ones (tinamous and kiwis) from the other side of the world, than to similarly large neighbours (ostrich and rhea). Time and again, physique and geography have proved to be poor guides to ratite evolution.There’s only one plausible explanation: the ratites evolved from small, flying birds that flapped their way between continents and independently lost the ability to fly on at least six separate occasions.The rafting hypothesis is dead, and the kiwi-elephant bird is the “final nail in the coffin”, says Michael Bunce from Curtin University, who studies ancient DNA. “A number of text-books need to be re-written.”Indeed, in his 2004 book The Ancestor’s Tale, Richard Dawkins writes, “I take delight in the power of natural selection, and it would have given me satisfaction to report that the ratites evolved their flightlessness separately in different parts of the world… Alas, this is not so.” Cheer up, Richard. It is so.The ratites are an incredible example of convergent evolution—the process where living things turn up to life’s party wearing the same clothes. “They all started as these small, flighted, partridge-like things and most of them became these large, giant forms that were so close that everyone assumed they must have started off like that,” says Cooper.Cooper thinks that the rise of the ratites took place shortly after the extinction event that wiped out most of the dinosaurs. Their absence created an ecological vacuum—there were lots of plants around and no big animals to eat them. The ratites filled those niches. Time and again, they evolved into big plant-eaters, losing the ability to fly in the process.After around 10 million years, the mammals started doing the same thing, and their success stopped other birds from following in the ratites’ footsteps. “The window of opportunity had gone,” says Cooper. “No bird after that point could try and become big and flightless again, or they’d get eaten. The ratites survived by running like hell.”This idea also explains why the kiwis and tinamous stayed small. Cooper thinks that they diversified in places that already had large flightless ratites—the moas and rhea. “These guys turned up after someone else had taken up the big and flightless niche, forcing them to do something alternative,” he says. “The kiwis became small, nocturnal insectivore. The tinamous kept flying.”The discovery raises other puzzles about kiwi evolution. Some scientists believed that kiwis lay disproportionately huge eggs because they evolved from a much larger ancestor. “This new paper proposes that kiwis have always been small, suggesting that egg size independently became large in kiwis even when body size did not,” says Rebecca Kimball from the University of Florida. “That may stimulate some new and interesting research.”If there’s a crack in this story, it’s that Cooper’s result is based on mitochondrial genomes—small, secondary sets of DNA within our cells. In the past, scientists have had to revise conclusions based on mitochondrial DNA after getting their hands on the main nuclear genome.  “The mitochondria only give us part of the picture,” says Bunce. “The next challenge is to peek into the nuclear genome.”“We’re working on that,” says Cooper. It’s not easy. Elephant birds tend to die in hot, humid, swampy conditions, which are awful at preserving DNA. Cooper’s team struggled for years to get enough material to sequence, before finally recovering enough from specimens stored in a New Zealand museum. It’ll be even harder to sequence the nuclear genome of these titans. Cooper adds, “The nuclear DNA from the other ratites, including the moa, confirms what we see from the mitochondria, so we’re not expecting too many surprises.”Reference: Mitchell, Llamas, Soubrier, Rawlence, Worthy, Wood, Lee & Cooper. 2014.

"When a Mongolian paleontologist sees a dinosaur skeleton illegally up for auction in the United States, she goes to great lengths to stop the sale.TRANSCRIPTBOLORTESTEG MINJIN (Paleontologist): You know, since 1920s, all fossils been found from Mongolia left the country. Either for research, or illegally—stolen.PETER GWIN (HOST): Bolortsetseg Minjin is a Mongolian paleontologist. Eight years ago, she saw something on TV that really made her mad.MINJIN: I saw local news in New York sitting in a coffee shop and showing this dinosaur, but they turned off the volume. I couldn't tell. I just assumed, Oh, maybe that's another new species of dinosaur. But then it looked Mongolian. So then I went home, and I search on Google. Then I found the image. And then that led me to auction house's website.GWIN: The auction house that was selling the dinosaur. It was a 24-foot skeleton of a Tarbosaurus bataar, a toothy monster similar to T. rex that’s only ever been found in Mongolia. It shouldn’t have been for sale.MINJIN: Then find out that this dinosaur is going to be auctioned in three days for almost for a million dollar. So it was...GWIN: Wait a minute, it was going to be auctioned for a million dollars?MINJIN: Yes. So I quickly wrote a email to Mongolia. We have to stop this auction.GWIN: And the Mongolian government replied. The office of the president issued a press release protesting the auction and asked Bolor to do whatever she could to stop it. At first she tried contacting the auction house, but a lawyer there replied saying the auction would go forward.MINJIN: So I quickly wrote, emailed back to president's office, said, OK, we need a lawyer. I can’t stop this.GWIN: So the president of Mongolia reached out to a lawyer he had met at a conference in the United States. A guy named Robert Painter, who specializes in medical malpractice in Texas. Robert had helped the president as an adviser, but he’d never gone to court for Mongolia before.ROBERT PAINTER (ATTORNEY): First time it was on my radar that there was even such a thing as a dinosaur auction, let alone one with questionable provenance, let alone one where I was being asked to, you know, do something legally to stop it.GWIN: But he was just as prepared as anyone. As far as Robert could tell, a dinosaur fossil had never been legally returned to another country from the United States. And he was about to file a lawsuit that would change that. I’m Peter Gwin, and you’re listening to Overheard at National Geographic: A show where we eavesdrop on the wild conversations we have here at Nat Geo—and follow them to the edges of our big, weird, beautiful world. This week: the first victory in the struggle to repatriate stolen fossils. More after this.GWIN: It was a Friday night when Texas lawyer Robert Painter got an email from the office of the president of Mongolia: Could he do anything to stop the auction of a dinosaur skeleton in New York? The auction was just two days away.PAINTER: The first thing I thought was—’cause it was a little after 6 p.m.—I thought, Boy, it would have been really nice to hear about this a couple hours ago, when the courts were still open. You know, from a lawyer’s perspective, it’s like, well, I need to get a judge. And where am I going to find a judge? It's, you know, after six o'clock on a Friday.GWIN: Even though the auction was happening in New York City, it just so happened that the auction house was headquartered in Dallas. This is key because Robert has a license to practice law in Texas. But Robert lives in Houston, and he needed a Dallas judge to sign a temporary restraining order. So he asked a friend in Dallas to help him find a judge.PAINTER: He called and said, Hey, Judge, I want to let you know my buddy from law school has a dinosaur auction, and the president of Mongolia wants it stopped and we need a TRO hearing—the restraining order hearing—and Judge Cortez hung up the phone. So when Kurt called him back. He said, Judge, did you hang up? He said, Quit pranking me, it's Friday night. He said, No, no, Judge, this is real. And so he said, Oh, OK. Well, yeah, have him come by at 10 or 11 or I forget what time. And he called me back, and we’re all good to go.GWIN: There was a lot to do before Robert could meet with the judge. For one thing, the relevant laws needed to be translated from Mongolian to English.PAINTER: In the U.S. legal system, you need evidence that's notarized, and it was already a Saturday in Mongolia and I was talking to the president's chief of staff and I said, We need this notarized. And he said, Well, we don't really do that. And I said, OK, well, can you—what can we do to make this official? And we decided just—I said, Just grab some seals, get the seal of state, or the president's seal. Start putting these seals on it to show this is official, this is legitimate.GWIN: Notarized or not, these Mongolian laws had been on the books for almost 100 years.PAINTER: It turns out that since Mongolia has been a free country, in the early 20th century, that they've had these laws that defined dinosaur fossils, among other things, as property of the government.GWIN: Although it had never been used in the U.S. before, the Mongolian dinosaur law was created in part because of the actions of another American.MICHAEL GRESHKO (WRITER, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC): I mean, this is not the first Mongolian dinosaur that's ever been auctioned off in the United States. These kinds of transactions had happened before.GWIN: Michael Greshko is a writer on our science desk who covers dinosaurs.GRESHKO: Mongolia is not a good place to find dinosaur bone—Mongolia is a great place to find dinosaur bone. Anybody who's watched Jurassic Park knows the name Velociraptor. Velociraptor is Mongolian. Protoceratops is Mongolian. And then there's also tyrannosaurids, this family of predatory dinosaurs.GWIN: You mean like Tyrannosaurus?GRESHKO: Like Tyrannosaurus. Yeah, not T. rex. T. rex is North American, but very close cousins, including Tyrannosaurus bataar, also known as Tarbosaurus bataar.GWIN: That’s the type of dinosaur that was for sale at the auction house. These bones come from the Gobi desert. The Gobi is twice the size of Texas, so it isn’t too surprising that paleontologists didn’t know the dinosaurs were there until about a century ago.GWIN: Who was the first place to sort of like show up there and go, wait a minute, this place is filled with dinosaurs?GRESHKO: Right. So in large part, we have to thank an American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews.GWIN: Roy Chapman Andrews was a real Indiana Jones type. In fact, some people say Harrison Ford’s character was based on him.GRESHKO: He's best known for a series of expeditions that he directed in Mongolia that are known as the Central Asiatic Expeditions.GWIN: And on these expeditions Andrews found a lot of fossils, including the first dinosaur eggs. At the time, scientists were dying to know if dinosaurs laid eggs. And Andrews found entire nests of them. Some even contained visible embryos.GRESHKO: Those eggs made a huge global splash when they were first announced in the early 1920s and made Andrews about as big as a celebrity as you could be at the time.GWIN: Andrews knew there were more discoveries to be made in Central Asia and he wanted to return. But to get back to the Gobi desert, he needed to raise millions of dollars. So he came up with an idea.GRESHKO: So one of the things he did was he took one of the 25 to 30 dinosaur eggs that they had collected and had an idea to auction it off.GWIN: And so the first Mongolian dinosaur fossil was auctioned off in the United States.GRESKO: The winning bid—$5,000—was from a guy named Austin Colgate, who was a vice president of the Colgate Company. He then turned around and donated that egg to Colgate University, and it's there to this day.GWIN: But the auction backfired. To the Mongolian government, Andrews’s trips seemed like they were more focused on profit than discovery.GRESHKO: He himself, you know, kind of rued the day he came up with this. He wrote that “I was very pleased, but it proved to be a boomerang. Nothing else so disastrous ever happened to the expedition. Up to this time, the Chinese and Mongols had taken us at face value. Now they thought we were making money out of our explorations. We had found about 30 eggs. If one was worth $5,000, the whole lot must be valued at 150,000.” The second that you put a dollar price on a fossil, the second you create all sorts of perverse incentives around science. And that push and pull has been with paleontology ever since.GWIN: The egg was auctioned off in 1924.GRESHKO: Later that year, Mongolia becomes the second communist country. There's a revolution in Mongolia, and they put together a new constitution. And that constitution specifies that Mongolia's fossils, its paleontological heritage, belong to the people of Mongolia. And from that time to now, it has been illegal to export Mongolian fossils from Mongolia.GWIN: And now, almost a century later, those laws were about to be tested for the first time in the United States. After getting them translated, lawyer Robert Painter asked the judge to intervene—the day before the auction.PAINTER: And by 10 or 11 a.m., I'm sitting in the judge's kitchen with him going over the petition and the evidence that we put together overnight, including having everything translated from Mongolian. And you know, fortunately, the judge found that to be persuasive and he just granted our TRO.GWIN: TRO, a temporary restraining order to stop the auction while the courts decided what to do. Robert sent copies to the auction house in every way he could think of.PAINTER: So I find all their emails and fax numbers and send them a copy of the restraining order. And then I thought, you know, I need to babysit this. So I got a colleague in my office who does video work and things, and we hopped on a flight, went straight to New York, then the next morning met with some Mongolian folks, and then headed straight over to the auction that morning, Sunday morning.GWIN: The dinosaur wasn’t the only thing for sale that day. There were gemstones and elephant tusks, ancient insects suspended in amber, even the skull of another Mongolian dinosaur, but Robert was there to stop the sale of the biggest item up for auction.PAINTER: They had the whole Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton fully assembled. And he was kind of towering over the whole auction watching.GWIN: And then one of Robert’s colleagues overheard some staff talking about the restraining order.PAINTER: So we overheard a call. This guy was speaking to someone, and said, Yeah, we're gonna go forward with the auction despite the order.GWIN: Ever hear the phrase “It’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission”?PAINTER: The thinking is that if someone bought it and didn't know that the ownership was disputed, then they could be a good-faith buyer, and there could be maybe some legal argument that they shouldn't have to give it up, because they bought and paid for it and didn't know about the dispute. So that's what we wanted to avoid.GWIN: He had to do something to stop the auction, but he wasn’t quite sure what. And then the bidding started.PAINTER: So I'm seated there. And I told my colleague from Houston, I want you to have your video camera ready, and mic and everything, because I want to capture this video.[Auction sound begins]PAINTER: As the auction begins, I get my phone, redial the judge real quick. Say, Judge, I'm at the auction and they are now proceeding to auction. Can you talk to them and explain that this violates your order? He said sure. So I stand up. And have the phone with the judge in it in my right hand, and I say, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have the judge from such-and-such court on the phone, and he wants to explain how this auction is violating a temporary restraining order. So the guy on the stage with the phone starts running toward me. He comes toward me, and he's kind of worked up and he want—he says, you know, We need to go to the back, go to the back. So we do. Meanwhile, the auctioneer just keeps going on like nothing's happening. So the guy on the phone bids and—sold. That's how it goes.GWIN: But the bidder didn’t collect the bones. There was still a temporary restraining order. And Robert was moving forward with the Mongolian president’s lawsuit against the auction house.GWIN: But the next day, a federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York called. Her office wanted to take over the effort to recover the fossil. So Robert dropped the Texas case and a new federal lawsuit took its place:PAINTER: United States v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar. So the United States is actually filing a lawsuit where a party to the lawsuit is a fossilized dinosaur.GWIN: And that’s not all.PAINTER: So we actually flew back up to New York and watched them go and arrest—the FBI arrested the dinosaur—and took him into custody.GWIN: The skeleton stayed in federal custody until it finally got its day in court several months later. With a team of other paleontologists, Bolor Minjin had inspected the fossil and determined that it was definitely from Mongolia. In record time, the skeleton was on its way back home.PAINTER: This was the first time ever that a dino—ever—that a dinosaur has been repatriated anywhere, let alone Mongolia. It was quite a feat.GWIN: It was the first time, but not the last. Since then, there have been more than 50 dinosaur fossils repatriated to Mongolia. But Nat Geo writer Michael Greshko says black-market fossils are still being sold throughout the world.GRESHKO: China formally, on the books, has laws preventing the export of fossils. A few years ago, I was in a museum in Europe. They were selling a Chinese dinosaur egg in the gift shop.GWIN: Wait a minute, you could have bought that? You could’ve just rolled up there and bought it?GRESHKO: I could have just rolled up there and bought it, and that—I was shocked when I saw it in there because the second I saw it, I knew it was hot. There is no way that that egg left the country legally.GWIN: Wow. So, I mean, if this is happening in European gift shops, I mean, that's pretty pervasive then, you would imagine. Right?GRESHKO: Yeah. This is a, I mean, it's a huge global trade.GWIN: And that trade gets in the way of science. When fossils are dug up for profit, they’re often altered in ways that make it difficult for scientists to study them later.GRESHKO: Poachers have come through paleontological sites and just… who come through with pick axes and basically work their way up a skeleton to find the skull. The skull is really valuable. And then if the skull breaks or whatever, then you just destroy the skull and you pull the teeth and claws because those sell.GWIN: This sort of destruction is one of the reasons why paleontologist Bolor Minjin keeps working to repatriate fossils to Mongolia.MINJIN: I don’t know, I've been doing now so long that it's almost become a job for me.GWIN: When a Mongolian dinosaur fossil is recovered, it ends up in a warehouse, like this one in Queens, where Bolor and a small team carefully package it up for the long flight back to Mongolia.MINJIN: So we have 10 dinosaur specimens.GWIN: Ten dinosaur specimens that weren’t always treated very well before they were recovered.MINJIN: And this specific dinosaur skull had five teeth been broken.GWIN: Bolor’s sending the specimens to the Natural History Museum of Mongolia. She hopes that they will inspire the next generation of Mongolian paleontologists.MINJIN: It’s not a thing you go to mall to purchase with money. It's a heritage, and generation to generation, we're supposed to, you know, share this heritage and knowledge. It's a part of Earth history. It's not just Mongolian. It's actually for the rest of the world.GWIN: We can’t make new fossils. So if we don’t protect the ones we have, who will?

Minions possessed by the fictional beast proclaim, “There is only Zuul!” But in real life, scientists have discovered a doppelgänger: Zuul crurivastator, a new genus and species of dinosaur with movie-monster looks.The creature is the most complete ankylosaurid—a type of club-tailed armored dinosaur—ever found in North America. It’s also amazingly preserved. Zuul’s armor fossilized in place, down to the furrowed soft tissues sheathing it. Preserved damage on Zuul’s flank may even chronicle its battles with other ankylosaurids. “It’s beyond our wildest dreams,” says David Evans, the Royal Ontario Museum paleontologist who is leading the study of Zuul.The tanklike herbivore died 76 million years ago in what’s now northern Montana, near an estuary fringing an ancient sea. Its bloated carcass somehow ended up in a river, where it got caught in a logjam and was quickly buried in sand. The animal stayed entombed until 2014, when private fossil excavators stumbled across the remains. The Royal Ontario Museum acquired the fossil in 2016, and in May 2017, museum researchers declared it a new type of dinosaur. While research on the fossil continues, Zuul has made its red-​carpet premiere—as the focus of a new museum exhibit.Read more about Zuul, the club-tailed Cretaceous beast known as the “destroyer of shins.”",
"Fearsome bony spikes jut from the skull of Zuul crurivastator, one of the most complete armored dinosaurs ever found. Zuul's demonic looks inspired researchers to name it after a monster from the film Ghostbusters—but the animal thirsted for buds, not blood; Zuul was an herbivore.On the second floor of Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum, the skeleton of an older, ganglier cousin of Tyrannosaurus rex stands tall. But if the creature were alive today, it might be limping. More than 70 million years ago, this Gorgosaurus would have been an apex predator in what are now the badlands of Montana and western Canada. Apex doesn't mean invincible, though. The animal's right shin is a mess of broken bone that healed over in life.What broke the poor tyrannosaur's leg? Short of hopping in a time machine, researchers can't be sure. But elsewhere in the same museum, visitors can get a glimpse of one of the best—and most exquisite—suspects in this Cretaceous cold case.Ankylosaurids are best known for their tails, which evolved into stiff sledgehammers capped with bony knobs up to two feet wide. Zuul's club may have helped it fend off predators or rivals within its own species, earning it the species name crurivastator—Latin for “destroyer of shins.”Meet Zuul crurivastator, a new species of ankylosaurid that's also the most complete fossil of its kind ever found in North America. In life, the animal was a 20-foot-long living tank bristling with armor and weighing as much as a white rhinoceros. In death, its hulking fossil is amazingly well-preserved from its snout to its sledgehammer-like tail—the perfect weapon for delivering bone-shattering damage.While Zuul's discovery was announced in May 2017, the fossil skull and tail were unveiled to the public on December 15 as part of a new museum exhibit. It's a multimedia extravaganza, featuring a full-size model of the fossil, a huge animation of Zuul in action, and even educational arcade games. (See pictures from an exhibit in New York that showcased dinosaurs in all their feathered glory.)The rest of the fossil is still being unlocked from its sandstone tomb in a much more sedate warehouse about a hundred miles east of the museum. On a chilly December morning a few days before the unveiling, I visit this facility, owned by Research Casting International, a museum exhibits firm in Trenton, Ontario. As snow gently falls outside, RCI president Peter May ushers me into the main workspace. The sour smell of polyester resin cuts the air as ventilators rumble in the background.May whisks me down the warehouse's main corridor to a brown tent shielding what looks like a concrete-filled sandbox. Four technicians in dusty blue smocks lie atop the block, buzzing away with tiny handheld jackhammers. Millimeter by millimeter, the needle-tipped tools reveal brownish mineral patches. To my astonishment, the leathery pebbles are bits of armor and individual scales.Releasing this unusually detailed fossil is achingly precise work, but it will be well worth it. Ankylosaur fossils are rare, and even when they are found, they're often scattered like puzzle pieces due to the decay process. With Zuul, it's almost as if the whole animal was instantly turned to stone.“It's among the very, very best-in-class of specimens out there,” says paleontologist Victoria Arbour, a curator at Canada's Royal BC Museum and an ankylosaur expert. Already, the scientists can see broken armor along its flank, a clue that Zuul sustained battle damage from other ankylosaurids.“The quality of the armor and skin preservation has exceeded our wildest dreams,” adds Royal Ontario Museum paleontologist David Evans, who is studying the dinosaur.When Arbour and Evans first announced Zuul, the find made headlines around the world. But in a twist of fate, they weren't the only Canadian paleontologists with a dinosaur to show off that week. Within days, Alberta's Royal Tyrrell Museum unveiled its own remarkable armored dinosaur, a new species later named Borealopelta markmitchelli. (Read more about Borealopelta in National Geographic magazine.)At first glance, the pair may evoke dino déjà vu, but they are very different animals. Borealopelta lived a full 35 million years earlier, and unlike Zuul, it didn't have a tail club. Borealopelta also was found years before Zuul, giving its caretakers a head start in preparing the fossil. In 2017, the world could see Borealopelta in all its glory, but at the time, Zuul's trip back to sunlight was only just beginning.Zuul began its march to immortality 76 million years ago, near a lush estuary in what's now northern Montana. Ferns and cousins of sycamore trees swayed in the wind, as crocodiles and turtles lurked beneath the water. Somehow, Zuul ended up dead in a river's shallows. As its carcass bloated and floated belly-up, it got caught in a logjam and meandered into an eddy. Waves of sand quickly secured most—but maybe not all—of the fossil. Researchers still haven't found Zuul's limbs, which scavengers may have gobbled up like dino kebabs.Once entombed, the dinosaur transformed into a golem, as iron-rich minerals preserved its flesh and bone. Some 40 feet of rock then piled atop Zuul's sandstone cocoon, and the eroding hillsides never came within 30 feet of the fossil. Eventually, the land above Zuul became a private ranch just south of the U.S.-Canada border.In 2014, commercial fossil collectors with a company called Theropoda started digging there to excavate the scattered bones of a Gorgosaurus. As the crew followed the skeleton down through a hundred feet of dirt, they struck hard sandstone. Suddenly, one excavator shouted, “This thing's an alien!” He was staring at something that definitely didn't belong to a tyrannosaur: an ankylosaurid's tail club.Despite marketing many of its fossils to private collectors, the Theropoda crew knew that Zuul was special and that it had to enter the public trust. Soon after finding it, the company contacted Evans, who urged the Royal Ontario Museum to acquire the fossil in 2016. (Learn more about the fossil trade in National Geographic magazine.)“This is how the system should work,” says Tommy Heitkamp, Theropoda's director of operations.For Arbour, Zuul's move to Canada presented a dream opportunity. In a stroke of luck, she was starting a two-year stint at the museum just as the fossil arrived. As she and Evans began studying the dinosaur's skull and tail, which had already been freed from rock, they realized the dinosaur was a newly seen kind of ankylosaurid.To honor the animal's weaponized tail, the pair picked the species name crurivastator, Latin for “destroyer of shins.” As for the genus name, its horns reminded Arbour of Zuul, the hellhound from the 1984 film Ghostbusters. To make the name official, Evans sought the blessing of a friend of his: paleontology enthusiast Dan Aykroyd, the movie's costar and cowriter. Aykroyd enthusiastically agreed.Meanwhile, the 20-ton block containing Zuul's body sat in RCI's warehouse, a silent reminder of the mammoth task ahead. Even getting it inside had been a challenge: The fossil was so heavy, the forklift holding it sank into the parking lot.The block stood untouched until January 2018, when preparators started working to expose Zuul's spine and ribcage. Eight months later, they were ready to tackle the dinosaur's back armor, requiring RCI to cut the block in half and then flip it over like a 17,000-pound pancake.Ever since, preparator Amelia Madill and her team have painstakingly revealed Zuul's armor. These five women now know the magnitude of the find better than anyone. “When the block arrived, I talked to my dad about it, and I said, Well, that's somebody's life's work right there,” Madill says. “It's an amazing job; it's unreal.”This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.Zuul is so unreal, it's put RCI behind schedule. It will take Madill's team until the end of 2018 to finish their work, if not longer. Only then will the fossil's scientific story really begin—including chemical searches for some of the dinosaur's original proteins.Back in the Royal Ontario Museum, the undisputed star of the new exhibit sits within a Plexiglas box: the skull of Zuul, its mouth agape, its brow perpetually furrowed. Staring at the creature, it almost seems to stare back, until I feel like I'm sensing the daily life it enjoyed 76 million years ago. These jaws once munched on Mesozoic meadows. These eyes with their bony lids once gazed out on a lost world.The more I look, the more the display cases and placards melt away. There is no present here, only the past brought back to stony life. There is no museum, only Zuul.",
"Spring and summer bring on some pretty epic weather like thunderstorms and tornados. That can also bring on some pretty epic learning opportunities.Weather is often the first science that kids learn and can inspire curiosity in other areas of science too. “Weather affects what kids do every day, like whether they can go outside and play or if they have to wear raincoats,” says Mary Fairbanks, lead education outreach meteorologist at the National Weather Service, which offers an online weather school for kids. “So they’re very much aware of the weather, and they want to learn why it happens.”Local meteorologists have tapped into kids’ curiosity by teaching them lessons on air and online. “Using hands-on activities will keep kids interested much longer than reading text lines in a book,” says Brittney Bowman, a meteorologist with WJHL in Johnson City, Tennessee. “Being able to physically see a process—especially one that the child created—can help them remember the concept.”Inspire your budding meteorologists with the following experiments, plus some video explainers.What you’ll need: A balloon, a lightbulb, wool (unless you want to use your hair), and a dark room.What to do: Blow up the balloon and have your kid rub it against the wool or their hair to build up static electricity. In a dark room, shake the balloon over the top of the unplugged lightbulb as close as you can without touching it. The bulb will flicker from the static in the air.The science: Charged particles called ions build up in clouds. These positive and negative ions group together so that each cloud develops a positive or negative charge. Positively charged clouds rise, creating a tall cloud called a thunderhead. Negatively charged clouds remain closer to Earth, which is also positively charged. (Check out a kid-friendly explanation of lightning.)But opposites attract. When the negative charges build up and become too much for the atmosphere to hold, they release electricity toward something positively charged—either another cloud or the ground. That’s what you see when lightning strikes.That’s sort of what’s happening with the balloon and wool: Rubbing the balloon builds up a negative charge, which creates static electricity. The bulb, like the ground, has a positive charge, which attracted the negative ions from the balloon. When too many negative ions built up in the balloon—zap! Your kids made a tiny bolt of lightning flicker inside the lightbulb.Watch it: Bowman demonstrates how lightning forms.What you need: Isopropyl alcohol and an empty plastic water bottleWhat to do: Pour about half an inch of isopropyl alcohol into the bottom of the bottle. Tightly screw on the cap, and swirl the alcohol around so that it wets the inside.Have kids grasp the bottle with both hands and twist their hands in opposite directions so that the bottle starts to crush in on itself. (Little ones might need some help.) The more they twist, the more difficult twisting will become. That’s because as they’re decreasing the space available inside the bottle, they’re increasing the bottle’s internal pressure.Twist the bottle until you can’t twist anymore. Then let go. Poof! You have a cloud. (See photos of the experiment on Nat Geo Kids.)The science behind the weather: A clear, blue sky usually means high atmospheric pressure and temperature compared to other areas nearby. That’s what’s happening inside the bottle as you twist: The pressure increases, which makes the contents hotter. A cloud forming in the sky needs moisture, atmospheric particles, and cooling air. By letting go of the bottle—which expands the space inside, therefore lowering the pressure and making the air cooler—the moisture that’s naturally in the air inside condenses on the alcohol particles to form a cloud. That’s just like moisture in the sky condensing on particles in the air to form a cloud.Watch it: Bowman demonstrates how to make a cloud.What you’ll need: A jar, scissors, balloon, paper, straw, tape or glue, markerWhat to do: Cut off the neck of the balloon. Then stretch the balloon over the jar’s opening so it’s flat like a drum. Have your kid to cut an arrow out of paper, and stick it inside the straw so it points outward. Lay the straw flat against the top-center of the balloon so that the arrow sticks out over the jar, and tape or glue. Place the jar beside a piece of paper you’ve taped to the wall, and draw a line straight out from the arrow’s point. Above this line, write “High Pressure;” below, “Low Pressure.” Boom: Your kid has just made a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure. Depending on the day’s atmospheric pressure, the arrow will rise and fall. Have kids record their readings as well as the weather over a few days.The science: Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air. When it increases, the air outside the jar will sink down on the balloon and the end of the straw, causing the arrow to rise and point to “High Pressure.” Outdoors, sinking air near the surface warms, and the moisture dries out. “That’s why we typically see clear conditions associated with high pressure,” Bowman says.When atmospheric pressure decreases, less air presses down on the balloon. The air inside the jar rises, causing the balloon to expand slightly and the arrow to fall. Outdoors, the air is also rising into the atmosphere, where it will cool and condense, then possibly fall as rain. That’s why when the arrow points to “Low Pressure,” clouds or storms are probably coming.Watch it: Bowman shows how to make a barometer.What you’ll need: 2 empty 2-liter bottles with labels removed, duct tape, tap water, food coloring or glitterWhat to do: Add a few drops of food coloring or scoops of glitter to one of your 2-liter bottles, then add water until it’s three-quarters full. Now line up the mouths of the bottles so they cover each other, and have your kid tightly tape them together so water can’t leak out. Help your kid flip the two bottles over so the full bottle is on top, and give it a spin.The science: As the water travels from the top bottle to the bottom bottle, it will continue to spin, creating a tornado. This water tornado keeps its shape because of centripetal force, which pulls the water toward the center of the bottle as gravity pulls it down. Real life tornados are a bit more complicated. Winds in a tornado keep spinning because they’re in “cyclostrophic balance.” (Fun fact: cyclo refers to cyclone, a low-pressure system, which is needed for a storm; trophic means to turn.) To create that spin, centrifugal force, the force you feel in a car going around a tight curve, pushes in the opposite direction of the force caused by the differences in atmospheric pressure as that pressure decreases higher up in the atmosphere. (In scientist-speak, that’s called the pressure gradient.)“The centrifugal force pushes outward, while the pressure gradient pushes inward,” Bowman says. “This balance results in a circular motion.” (Check out a kid-friendly description of tornadoes.)Watch it: Bowman demonstrates how to make a tornado in a bottle.",
"You gather the family to capture the perfect vacation selfie. The result is not pretty. Faces are cut off, random people are in the background, and there’s no telling where the heck you actually are. Who better to help solve the selfie situation than a National Geographic photographer? Erika Larsen has traveled from Peru to Scandanavia to Hawaii photographing people—and that includes selfies with her husband and four-year-old son, Pauhlo. She gives her tips on taking the perfect family selfie.Head out early in the morning or during sunset, when the light is even. “The key is to avoid having a mix of dark and light in your photo,” Larsen says. If noon is the only time you can gather everyone, look for a shady area to avoid squints.Sure, you want to show where the photo was taken, but who wants to see a giant Eiffel Tower behind your antlike family? “People should be the focus of the family selfie,” Larsen says. Palm trees, stone walls, and interesting building textures are good backdrops. Cars, telephone wires, reflective windows … not so much.Getting everyone in the frame can be challenging— especially with energetic kids. The farther away the camera is from the subject, the more you can include in the shot, so whoever has the longest arms should take the pic. Still struggling to get everyone in the frame? Let the kids jump on a picnic table or rock so everyone is at the same level.Check out more of Erika Larsen’s work on Instagram, @erikalarsen888.",
"Most kids will never see a wolf pack in their backyard or an otter in their neighborhood creek. But birds? They’re everywhere—and that’s why they make great photography subjects for children.Not that birds are the easiest things to photograph—they’re small, have faraway perches, and tend to, well, fly away. But naturalist and wildlife photographer Lucas Bustamante says that by simply being curious about the fliers, kids will increase their chances of snapping great pics. Plus, focusing on birds can help kids focus on other natural surroundings as well.“If we activate the naturalists we have inside, we activate and wake up our senses that normally we might miss in our fast and busy lifestyles,” he says. Here are some “cardinal rules” (pun intended) for helping kids snap some great shots of the highfliers.Start in your own backyard. To help kids develop patience and curiosity, begin your photographic adventures right outside your own home. “We photographers are often asked questions about where we started, but we’ve all started in our backyards,” Bustamante says. “That’s where you start training your eye. Just study the animals in your backyard and the interactions they have.”Know before you go. Before kids take their first shot, do some research together about the birds in your area and where to find them. “Listen to bird calls, look at pics, and learn the birds you might see,” says conservationist and photographer Melissa Groo, who recommends the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Brush up on bird behavior. Helping kids learn about how certain species might act can improve their photo skills. “For instance, some birds, such as red-tailed hawks and bald eagles poop just before they take flight,” Groo says. “Photographers call it ‘lightening the load’ and they know to get ready for a flight shot when they see that happen!”Attract the birds—but ditch the bird calls. Encourage kids to place natural seeds or fruits that local species enjoy in the backyard. “Study which birds are in your area and the trees they feed on,” Bustamante says. “If you plant them, the birds will come to you.”But don’t use whistles or bird-calling apps to attract birds, which can fool them into wasting energy looking for a fake bird instead of hunting for food and caring for young. “Some species of birds can be disturbed by these calls,” Bustamante says.Catch some wind. Photographing birds in-flight is easier if kids are prepared. “Birds love to take off into the wind,” Groo says. “Position yourself upwind of birds if you hope to capture them taking off in flight.” Since capturing moving targets on camera can be tricky, Bustamante suggests practicing beforehand. “Try following moving objects with your camera or phone. This will help train your stability and will result in better action pics.”Be an early bird. Kids might not like this tip, but often the best bird shots come early in the morning, when the fliers are claiming their territories and hunting. The early morning dew attracts worms, so children will be likely to catch breakfasting birds. After that comes their songs to potential mates. “It’s called the dawn chorus—and it’s a fabulous thing to experience,” Groo says.Focus on the eyes. Although keeping the photo sharp is key, focusing on the eyes will help a child hone in on the bird’s face better. “Your camera’s focus point should be centered on the eyes when you press the shutter,” Groo says. “It’s super important for the eyes to be sharp, as that’s where our own eyes, as viewers, go.”Work all the angles. Having kids move a couple of feet to the right or left can produce a better shot than shooting the first angle they see. “In nature photography, things that are behind or in front of your subject are crucial,” Bustamante says. “If things look cluttered, it can be distracting for the observer. Try moving gently around your subject [so you don’t affect its behavior] to find a cleaner background and foreground for the shot.”Get the best light possible. Bright sunlight can create a harsh contrast or shadows under the bird, so stick to early mornings or overcast days before the sun is high in the sky. “This is called ‘the golden hour,’ but if it’s overcast all day, you can shoot all day,” Groo says. “The perfect day for me is sunny for an hour or two, then it gets overcast, and then gets sunny again the last couple of hours.”Get the color correct. Then challenge kids to think about which conditions will best show off the birds’ color. “Some birds—like European starlings or painted buntings—look better in overcast light or rain since it gives color a saturated quality,” Groo says. “And you’ll want to photograph white birds only late in the day or in overcast conditions, or they’ll be bright white with no detail.”Seek out surprising spots. Think beyond wooded areas or your backyard. “The beach or a shore can be a great place to find ospreys, terns, and pelicans fishing,” Groo says. “Garbage dumps can even be great places to find gulls, which are also awesome for practicing your takeoff and landing action shots!”Look for city birds. Another surprising spot to find and photograph birds can be in urban settings like parks, streetlights, or even skyscrapers. “These birds are used to people walking around and know that they don’t normally pose a threat,” Groo says. “So it gives you a good opportunity to stick around and see some of their natural behavior.”Watch for guest stars. Kids shouldn’t be looking for only an amazing bird shot. Paying attention to the surprising harmony birds have with surrounding wildlife can create fantastic photos as well. “If you see that a bird is coming to the same spot each day, you’ll notice its interaction with the other birds, bugs, and animals in its environment,” Bustamante says.Be a storyteller. A bird does more than just fly in the sky or perch in a tree. “There are birds fighting, birds looking for or showing off for mates, birds feeding young, or birds migrating through after they’ve just flown 2,000 miles,” Groo says. Before kids take a shot, ask them what that bird might be doing—and what it might do next. “Think of it like a game of Red Light, Green Light,” Groo says. “When a bird goes back to its natural behavior and starts foraging again, creep up a few more steps.”Show some respect. If the birds change their behavior or seem agitated, have kids give the fliers a break for a bit. “It’s crucial to know your subjects well enough to know when they feel uncomfortable,” Bustamante says, adding that maintaining a comfortable distance will help birds feel unthreatened by the photographer.",
"Here’s something worth tweeting about: Being around more birds can boost your family’s happiness. A German study of more than 26,000 Europeans found that the cheeriest folks lived near natural areas with a wider diversity of bird species.And no need to know the difference between wood thrush and white-throated sparrow whistles—turns out simply seeing and hearing a variety of feathered friends is enough. (Although learning how to ID birds’ songs and calls is a cool way to tune into nature with kids. And here are some bird bios to get them started.)Since songbirds in particular tend to be cute and colorful, it seems natural that having more of them close by would be a good thing. But the mood lifter isn’t from the birds alone, researchers say. Instead, it’s the rich biodiversity, or variety of life, found in places birds call home. Here’s a quick look at why nature makes kids happy, as well as some tips for turning your backyard into a mini birding sanctuary.“Many studies have shown that spending time outside in nature, or even viewing it from a window, can benefit mood and cognitive function, as well as reduce stress and anxiety,” says Greg Bratman, assistant professor of nature, health, and recreation at the University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences.For instance, this “nature pill” study found that a 20-minute nature break can significantly reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Other studies, Bratman says, have shown similarly positive impacts on heart rate, blood pressure, and other aspects of the autonomic nervous system.That’s why Bratman, who led a review of research linking the environment and well-being, encourages families to make nature part of their daily lives.“Trips to natural areas can contribute to well-being,” he says. “But regular instances of experiences with nearby nature can have effects as well.”But why are birds so important to nature’s biodiversity—and therefore your family’s potential happiness? For one thing, birds are an indicator species, meaning they basically function as a “check engine light” for biodiversity. When something is out of whack in nature, birds let us know—often by disappearing—because they need a healthy environment to survive.Of course, birds aren’t the only indicator, but since they’re found almost everywhere in the world and are easy to study, their presence—or absence—is a good way to measure the variety of life that research shows can boost mood.So, would biodiversity without birds have the same effect? For instance, could seeing lots of poop-eating dung beetles—an indicator species in some parts of the world—increase happiness? Or is there something about birds that naturally sparks joy?Scientists are still learning, says Clint Francis, a Cal Poly biology professor who supervised a recent study showing that hearing bird songs while hiking can hike up our sense of well-being. The authors suggest this is both due to the sounds themselves and the perception that more birds mean greater biodiversity.Francis says that one reason birds might make us feel better could be related to how our ancestors used birdsong and chatter as a cue for danger.“I think many people can relate to the experience of walking through a forest—birds are singing and chattering—then suddenly everything goes quiet,” he explains. “Our subconscious, and that of many animals, uses passive listening as a surveillance mechanism. Thus, sudden quiet is immediately brought to our attention for possible danger.”Hearing birds might also produce positive effects because it reminds us of previous happy experiences in nature. That’s because the part of the brain—the temporal lobe—that processes memories also processes sensory information, meaning a specific sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch could become part of a memory. “Birdsong in particular might signal the arrival of nice weather and that harsh winter conditions are behind us,” Francis adds.Although hearing more bird sounds is good for people, Francis says human-made noise is bad for birds. Based on his research and other studies, unwanted sounds—like traffic and gas-powered leaf blowers—tend to keep birds away. Plus, more background noise makes it hard to hear the birds that are already there.“This is likely one reason why people reported seeing and hearing more birds during the COVID-19 lockdown,” he explains.So turning down the noise even a little bit in your yard (for instance, by using battery-powered lawn equipment or planting tall hedges as natural sound barriers) will increase the number and variety of birds your family can see—and improve your ability to hear them, too!To bring more biodiversity, birds, and happiness into your family’s life, create a wildlife habitat garden with the kids, says David Mizejewski, a National Wildlife Federation naturalist and the author of Attracting Birds, Butterflies and Other Backyard Wildlife. No matter the size of your outdoor space, you can build a bird-friendly habitat using these five steps:Plant a native smorgas-bird. “Native plants are natural feeders that provide the variety of seeds, berries, nuts, and insects birds eat,” Mizejewski says. (Use this free Audubon native plants database to figure out what works in your region.) You can also use bird feeders—Mizejewski suggests starting out with black oil sunflower seeds (birds love it!)—as supplemental food sources. (Here’s one feeder the kids can make themselves.)Add water. Birds need water for drinking and bathing. A simple birdbath or a one- to -three-inch-deep dish works well. (Check out this kid-friendly DIY.) Mizejewski suggests putting water in an observation area where kids can record the bird species they see in a journal or in a family eBird account for citizen science purposes.Create hideouts. Densely planted areas give birds a place to escape predators and bad weather. “Kids enjoy building forts and dens, so enlist their help in choosing where to plant,” Mizejewski says. Roosting boxes (similar to birdhouses but with the hole at the bottom) are great for cold nights. “There are perches inside where multiple birds can fit,” he explains. “Their body heat kind of warms it up.”Make room for baby. To reproduce and raise their young, birds need places to build nests. Help them by planting native trees and shrubs and protecting existing ones. “Many species build nests right into the branches, but cavity nesters use holes, oftentimes old woodpecker holes, in tree trunks,” Mizejewski says. For a fun activity after leaves disappear in the fall, take kids on a scavenger hunt to see where the birds built their nests.Go natural. Keep the habitat you created healthy for wildlife by avoiding insecticides and other potentially harmful products. And don’t forget to keep cats indoors so they don’t “go natural” and kill the birds!",
"Birds have favorite places, just like people. Although some birds seem to live just about everywhere, most birds prefer a specific type of habitat. That’s because the land and plants of an area provides them with what they need to live a healthy life. Help kids identify birds they see with this downloadable U.S. state bird map.For instance, sandpipers are found on mudflap and beaches, not up in trees with woodpeckers, of course! Many species—especially smaller birds— don’t move around too much. The same chickadees that come to your feeder in fall and winter probably nest nearby in the summer. Some birds, like hawks and vultures, might fly many miles every day searching for food. Other birds migrate long distances, but once they get to where they want to nest or to spend the winter, most of them stay put for months.Even within a specific habitat, there are places that are especially attractive to birds: places that have lots of food or that are safe to nest or to roost overnight. If you want to see lots of birds, be on the lookout for these special locations:• Edges. Anywhere the habitat changes from one type to another, such as the place where a forest stops and a field begins.• Sheltered Areas. Birds are attracted to small areas out of the wind because they tend to be warmer, especially in winter.• Water. Water is a magnet for all kinds of birds in all kinds of places, from deserts to mountains.• Your Backyard. A backyard or common area where you can put up a bird feeder and birdbath is likely to attract a large number of birds.Once you are watching a bird, it’s time to play detective. Each bird you see is a mystery for your family to solve. And like any detective, you have to search for clues and gather evidence to help you solve each mystery. Here are things to look for.WHAT ARE ITS FIELD MARKS? “Field mark” is the term that bird-watchers use to describe something unique about a particular species of bird. Field marks are the clues that will help you put a name to a mystery bird. The first thing that most people notice about a bird is its color, but there are a lot of other field marks. Sometimes you need only one clue to identify a mystery bird, but often you need several clues to find the answer. Here’s a list of the most important types of field marks to consider:• Color• Size• Shape• Behavior• SongWHAT COLOR IS THE BIRD?There are completely red birds (male cardinals) and completely black birds (crows), but most birds are a combination of colors. Remember to look at the pattern of dark and light areas on a bird, as well as its colors. Can you see streaks on the chest, spots on the wings, or a white tail? Noticing these patterns can help you tell similar birds apart.HOW BIG IS THE BIRD?It helps to compare a new bird to a common one you already know. For instance, is it bigger than a robin or smaller than a robin? Try thinking of it this way:• Tiny—Hummingbirds• Small—Sparrows, chickadees, wrens• Medium—Robins, jays, blackbirds• Large—Crows, hawks, ducks• Huge—Eagles, herons, pelicans, swansWHAT SHAPE IS THE BIRD? Is it tall and slender with long legs for wading in the water? Does it have a crest like a Blue Jay or Northern Cardinal? Or is it small with short legs for hopping on the ground? What is the shape of its bill? You might not be able to give your mystery bird a name just by looking at its shape, but you can often figure out what type of bird it is. For instance, that tall bird with long legs might be a heron and that small bird with short legs hopping on the ground is probably a sparrow.Songs and call notes can be as important as visual clues. Each bird species has its own special songs and calls. Some birds have such memorable songs that they are named for them. Chickadees really do go chick-a-deedee-dee and the Eastern Phoebe calls out fee-bee. Some experienced birders can identify birds just by their songs and calls. Even if you don’t recognize a bird’s song, it’s a great clue to where it may be hiding.It is possible to look at birds without binoculars—for example, at a window feeder or a park where the birds have become tame. But, almost always, binoculars help you see birds much more clearly. Through binoculars the birds will appear close up, so you can see details. And with binoculars, you can easily see birds that are flying high in the sky or feeding up in the treetops. Many families have a pair of binoculars that are used at sporting events or concerts. While these may not be ideal binoculars for looking at birds, they are better than no binoculars at all.A small notebook and a pencil are useful, but not essential. Encourage the kids to jot down the date and place and what birds they saw, and any interesting details about the bird. Later, if they start a life list (a list of all the species you have ever seen), they'll have a record of the birds they've already seen. For starters, try keeping a list of the birds your family sees in your backyard taped to the refrigerator and update it with new birds as you see them.Bird guides are great to have, but it would be better to concentrate on watching the birds when you’re outside and look the birds up in the book later on.Clothing in bright colors, bold patterns, or white can scare birds. If possible, wear tan, dark green or olive, dark blue, or brown. Avoid noisy nylon jackets or pants that make loud, swishy noises when you walk. Wearing a baseball-style hat will shield your eyes from the sun’s glare and make it easier to see birds in the treetops or soaring high in a sunny sky. Don’t wear sunglasses, though; they make it impossible to see birds hiding in darker places.• Be quiet and careful. If you make noise, talk in a loud voice, or get too close, the birds will get scared and fly away. Be stealthy and sneak up on birds, so they stay put and you can look at them. You can get fairly close if you try! And when you do, you might be able to snap some photos.• Don’t disturb nesting birds, their nests, eggs, or baby birds. If you come upon a baby bird on the ground that is not yet able to fly, leave it where it is. Chances are, the baby bird’s mother knows where it is and will come to feed it. If it has left the nest, it may be close to being able to fly. Although a baby bird that has left the nest too soon may not make it, baby birds that are “rescued” by people often die. If you’re in doubt, call your local Audubon Society or a veterinarian.• Respect private and public property. Make sure your kids ask permission before going onto private property—like yards, country clubs, or private beaches—to look at birds. While in parks or nature preserves, stay on paths, trails, or boardwalks, and don’t do anything to damage the environment. When there are no trash cans around, put your litter in your pocket or backpack and take it home with you.• HAVE FUN!Text adapted from National Geographic Kids Bird Guide of North America, by Jonathan Alderer",
"When 16-year-old Violet Brill looks out her window, she doesn’t see only grass and trees—she sees a whole feast. Her father, legendary plant expert Steve “Wildman” Brill, introduced her to the world of wild edibles as a baby, toting her along on his foraging tours from the time she was just two months old.“I just started picking it up,” Violet says, “kind of like the way kids learn to recognize celery and carrots.”Until the advent of agriculture about 12,000 years ago, our hunter-gather ancestors relied upon wild vegetation for nutrition and medicine. In the millennia that followed, farms and grocery stores replaced that primal knowledge. But in the past decade or so, a renewed interest in foraging for edible plants has begun to emerge—an interest that has truly blossomed during the pandemic.“I think we’ve had a lot of time to slow down, get outdoors, and look around,” says Adele Nozedar, author of Foraging for Kids. “The growth in foraging has been exponential in the past year.”Steve Brill agrees. “People have been doing a lot more cooking,” he says, “and they’re becoming more interested in nature and ecology and the environment.”Kids are natural-born foragers. Take them out into the woods and they’ll happily gather fallen leaves, pluck berries from bushes, or root around in the undergrowth for hidden treasures. “Foraging is definitely a gateway to nature,” Violet Brill says. “Kids learn quickly that it’s not just a bunch of green stuff outside. All those plants have a purpose.”And by encouraging a love of nature, foraging also encourages a love of the environment. “Having a strong connection to the land means you’re more likely to protect it,” says Dave Hamilton, author of Family Foraging. “And you can’t get much more connected to the land than eating from it.”Plus, foraging brings good news for parents of picky eaters: When kids search for and pick their own food, they’re more likely to be invested in it. Foraging for wild edibles encourages kids to try new, nutritious foods—especially kids who tend to turn their noses up at the vegetables on their plates.For instance, Hamilton remembers taking a group of boys camping and asking them to gather enough lambsquarters for dinner. They came back with three days’ worth of the greens, which he turned into a pesto.“They absolutely loved it,” he says. “There’s something empowering about finding your own food, especially for kids.”Finally, foraging—and the romping around outdoors that comes with it—is just a lot of fun. When you set out on a foraging adventure, you never know what you may find. Maybe it’s a big patch of blackberries or a hidden stash of tender ramps, or even a bright orange salamander wriggling beneath a damp log while you’re looking for mushrooms. It’s also a safe, socially distanced way to boost kids’ moods, providing them with an opportunity to get out into nature and reconnect with others. (This article shows how getting kids into nature can boost their brainpower.)Learning to forage is easier than ever. Here are some guidelines to get your family started.Keep it simple. Begin by learning to recognize just a few, easy-to-identify plants that don’t have any dangerous look-alikes. Dandelions, garlic mustard, and common plantain all tend to grow in grassy backyards and local parks, so they’re especially prolific. Other wild plants, like ramps, garlic mustard, staghorn sumac, wood sorrel, and blackberry are found in abundance in forests, fields, and even along the side of the road.“Don’t feel like you have to have an entirely wild food meal,” reassures Hamilton. “It could be that you forage for the same two, three, or four plants for the first couple of years. There are baby steps to this.”Gather your gear. Foraging doesn’t require fancy equipment, but it’s wise to dress for the adventure. Long pants tucked into socks or worn with a pair of rain boots protect from brambles and ticks. A pair of gardening gloves can help harvest prickly plants like nettles and berries, and scissors or garden clippers are handy for snipping leafy greens.Collect your harvest in paper and resealable plastic bags—the former are best for things like mushrooms, which need to breathe. Finally, a good plant identification guide— either a book or an app—is essential.Start a foraging journal. Recording their foraging adventures reinforces plant recognition and helps remind children where and when certain plants can be found. In their journals, kids can draw pictures of the plants they harvest; bring a small magnifying glass to examine a plant’s characteristics, or snap pictures with your smartphone.Kids can document how the same plants change throughout the seasons, a tally of the various plants they gather, and maps of foraging locations. They can also store leaf pressings, plant rubbings, or simply their thoughts on their experiences.And remember, safety first! As every veteran forager will tell you, never allow your kids to eat any wild plants unless you’re unequivocally sure of what it is. Going on a guided foraging tour can be an excellent way to develop some basic knowledge.During the tour, take pictures of the plants your guide points out, and have your child take notes on the plants’ traits so that you can identify it on your own the next time. “You can’t beat someone saying to you, ‘This is what you need to look for, it has this, it has that,’” Hamilton says.But beware: Foraging is habit forming! “As soon as you learn to identify a plant, you’re going to start seeing it everywhere,” says Violet Brill. Hamilton agrees: “Once you catch the foraging bug, there’s no turning back.”Whether you’re looking to identify common plants, take a foraging class, or simply figure out what the heck to do with the big bags of nettles you brought home, this list of resources will help.Foraging With Kids by Steve “Wildman” BrillThis book includes 76 easy-to-find wild plants and includes activities, science and history, games, and recipes.

"Parents at the Schlitz Audubon Nature Preschool in Milwaukee like to share the changes they notice in their children. After spending hours outside each day—clambering over logs, exploring under rocks, learning to quietly observe wildlife—shy children became bolder, and hesitation gradually morphed into confidence.Teachers noticed a difference too: The kids could sit still when needed, became more attentive listeners, and could better regulate their behavior.“I’d meet teachers at other schools who would say, ‘I know kids who came from that preschool,’” says school founder and former director Patti Bailie, now an assistant professor of early childhood education at the University of Maine. “They ask more questions, are willing to try new things, and are more caring with the other children.”The idea of having children connect with nature has long been held up as beneficial for the body and mind. Time spent outdoors has been linked with improved attention spans, better memory, and enhanced executive function—how we learn versus what we learn. Bailie adds that nature experiences are positively linked to early brain development and provides opportunities to hone gross motor skills, stimulate brain-boosting chemicals that improve neuron-to-neuron communication, and help produce new cells in the brain.“There’s now enough evidence that shows a very causal link between outdoor learning and academic achievement,” says Sarah Milligen-Toffler, executive director of the Children & Nature Network. “We know now there are very specific ways nature impacts our ability to learn and engage.”Here are some insights from the experts about how weaving outdoor or nature-based activities into your child’s life can boost their brainpower.A central tenet of the “brain-based learning” theory is that movement can strengthen the brain’s ability to learn, retain, and recall lessons. The approach got its start in the mid-’90s, after studies showed that many of the same neural pathways in the cerebellum, a highly complex area of the brain involved in coordinating motor movements, are also related to learning processes.Further research indicated that activities involving cross-lateral movement, or reaching across the body with arms and legs, specifically helps the two sides of the brain connect and communicate. That means that things like digging for treasure and crouching to inspect insects could be directly connected with improved reading and writing skills.With apologies to neat freaks, that means that clutter that kids must interact with can actually be good—outdoors in a yard, in the corners of local parks, or other natural spaces you might have access to.The key word is “unstructured.” Beyond just toys in the yard, it’s as much about supplying your kids with tools like shovels and spoons as it is about leaving sticks and brush in the yard to build with. Take kids to a nearby waterway to turn over stones and look for invertebrates and amphibians, or to unpaved hiking trails with plenty of logs and boulders to jump on and navigate around.“What’s inviting to a child is the lack of adult dominance,” says Nooshin Razani, a pediatrician and founding director of the Center for Nature and Health at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland. “It’s not too well-groomed and not barren. Plain grass is not that fun. It needs little things kids can move around and play with. Then it becomes a landscape for opportunity and creativity.”Nature provides many opportunities for close observation—and fostering this skill builds kids’ ability to concentrate and learn about the world around them. Think handheld magnifying glasses and microscopes; even inexpensive ones can reveal amazing details. Take a “micro-hike” in your yard, a local park, or even a weedy vacant lot and record what plants and animals you find along a 50-foot path.Ask questions: What’s in dirt? How do leaves from different trees compare? What birds and insects can we find from the window, balcony, yard, or park?These kinds of inquiry-based activities spark interest and curiosity—and don’t require trips to special places. In fact, one study looking at MRI brain scans of children in Barcelona found that merely having access to street-level green space, even being able to see trees and sky from a window, was associated with increased gray and white matter in areas of the brain linked to memory, attention, and cognitive test scores.“There is a strong link between attention and learning,” Bailie says. “The idea is that when children explore the natural world, they do it with a lot of interest and attention. And things that grab your attention are connected to memory.”Milligen-Toffler acknowledges that while getting out into nature isn’t always easy, literally anything your family has access to can be beneficial. Live in a city? Seeing the sky and trees, exploring what’s in the street below, or identifying local species are great ways to connect. And even books, TV shows, and apps can help.“We often think of ‘nature’ as something on a huge scale—and certainly you experience that in the mountains or at the ocean,” she says. “But we know that even looking at pictures of nature helps the brain.”Rashani, well-known for her “park prescriptions,” says that one aspect to outdoor time often goes overlooked: its role in building and fostering healthy relationships.In her clinical practice in the San Francisco Bay area, Rashani uses trips to area parks as part of therapeutic interventions to promote healing for families struggling with poverty, depression, and other issues.In her research, she’s noted that the outdoor environment can help people build beneficial social ties. Her observations are backed by other inquiries: a 2018 study found that talking to kids while taking even short excursions resulted in increased talkativeness, responsiveness, and communication between parents and children.Some of Rashani’s current work explores using nature as a dose—just like medicine. In clinical trials, she’s studying how the outdoors and nature can be used to treat depression and anxiety in kids as well as families.“If we’re going to take nature seriously as a health intervention, we do need guidelines on how much, how often, and for whom nature can be of use,” she says. “And we know that just one strong relationship with a parent can do all kinds of good things for childhood brain development.”She recalls a 13-year-old girl and her mother who were early participants in the parks prescription program. Living in a family shelter at the time, the daughter had trouble with anxiety and maintaining a healthy weight. But after they began going on nature outings, they were both able to tune in better to their own emotional needs, and the daughter’s anxiety and weight issues improved.“The outdoors gives you a landscape for building that relationship within a family,” Razani says. “Families need to know that they have the right to take a bit of time off every day to be together—and that it has actual health benefits.”",
"When Jen Farr and her eco-conscious family noticed their bathroom trash was piling up, they decided to investigate the problem. With their two 11- and 13-year-old daughters, the Toronto family used gloved hands to sift through used tissues, cotton balls, and dental floss—then they made a plan.This review process, called a trash audit, is a way for families to fight back against the mounting problem of waste: The average American creates 4.9 pounds of trash a day, almost double the amount Americans created in 1960. According to one study, all operating U.S. landfills will be full in 62 years if we continue this pace of waste.It might be difficult at first for your kids to see all the waste that your family has created—they might’ve already forgotten about that toy packaging or half-eaten sandwich they discarded a few days ago. But once kids understand that their trash doesn’t just go away, they can feel empowered to make changes in their behavior that will result in real-life consequences.“A trash audit can increase a kid’s sense of efficacy in addressing environmental problems,” says Susan Clayton, a conservation psychologist and professor of psychology at the College of Wooster.Trash audits are built around a concept called self-monitoring, which means being aware of your own behavior. For example, you might notice a higher charge than usual on a water bill, and then later you’ll think to turn off the tap while you’re brushing your teeth.“You can start making connections between your past choices and their consequences,” says Nicole Sintov, an environmental psychologist and assistant professor at Ohio State University.After the audit, the Farr family realized they could divert half their waste from the trash can to the compost bin. Even better, Farr says the activity has helped her daughters remember to throw away trash in the proper receptacles and avoid using single-use plastics.Ready to review your refuse? Check out options for either a trash audit or trash inventory, based on your space, time, and willingness to get dirty.What you’ll need:• A pair of rubber gloves for each family member• A tarp (or use multiple plastic garbage bags)• Paper and pencil• Cleaning suppliesGather items and make space. Choose a trash can to review and a time to do the audit when the bin is pretty full. Then find the space. (We recommend a backyard if one’s available—this will get stinky.)Dump and sort. Dump the contents of the trash can onto the tarp. Wearing rubber gloves, separate the trash into piles: food waste, recyclable stuff, and true trash. Then keep sorting the items by type, depending on what you have. You might place all plastic food containers together or make a pile of paper scraps.Collect data. Ask your kids to write down what’s on the tarp and how many of each item. (You can recreate or print out a simple chart here.) Ask your kids to write down any patterns they see: Are there lots of granola bar wrappers? Tons of tissues? (Your kids might want to turn this data into a graph or pie chart later.) Turn the audit into a game by asking each kid to find the grossest or most surprising piece of garbage in the pile.Talk some trash. Connect the garbage to the zero-waste concepts of refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot. For instance, could you have refused a straw that you found in the trash? Could you have used a reusable container instead of the plastic sandwich bag you found? Did your family have to buy this type of plastic-wrapped popcorn or could you have bought kernels? Can kids reuse this plastic strawberry container? Are we putting the trash in the correct recycling and composting bins?If you don’t have the space or time for a full trash audit, tape a piece of paper near the bin. Every time a family member throws something away, ask him or her to write it down. After a week, review the results as a family.“You're getting that feedback many times a day,” Sintov says. “Research shows that the more frequent that kind of feedback is, the more effective it is.”One of the reasons a trash audit can be so effective for kids is because it’s a “sticky” learning experience that allows them to play with something they’re typically taught not to touch. “It’s a hands-on experience that engages their senses of sight, smell, and touch,” says Mary DeMocker, author of The Parents’ Guide to Climate Revolution. “It’s a whole different way of learning.”After your family sorts through the waste, your kids might be inspired to make changes in their own life. That might mean asking to put low-waste snacks on the grocery list or walking away from cheap toys and decorations.“Once kids see the dozen single-use plastic birthday cups they begged Mom for now heading to the landfill, they may choose to opt for reusable glasses next time,” DeMocker says.She adds that parents can also hammer home the lessons by empowering kids to come up with creative solutions to cut down on waste. For example, if the audit has revealed a lot of recyclable items in the trash, kids could create a poster to remind family members to recycle. If it’s turned up too many stinky food scraps, perhaps they could start their own composting system. (Here are kid-friendly step-by-step instructions.)You could also enlist their help in grocery planning. Could your kids help plan a family meal that they’ll definitely finish? Could you buy one big tub of yogurt and serve it in reusable containers instead of little packaged bowls? (Maybe you could even start making your own yogurt.)“Handing kids the tools to effect change even just in the household empowers them,” DeMocker says. “It brings out their creativity and ingenuity.”",

"The coronavirus pandemic might have had a silver lining—make that a green lining. When most of the world went into lockdown in 2020, planes stopped flying, commuters stopped commuting, and daily emissions dropped 17 percent below the previous year’s average, according to research published in Nature Climate Change. It was the single biggest drop in CO2 emissions ever recorded.Now that we're returning to work and school, these gains could quickly disappear. Or maybe not.“We can’t just turn off our economy to reduce carbon emissions; that’s not a good solution,” says Elizabeth Thomas, a climate change scientist and professor at the University at Buffalo.Here’s how you can keep the momentum going by turning your family into carbon, water, and waste warriors.Charge carefully. Everyone is using more gadgets—and that means more time spent charging. “Up to 23 percent of the electricity consumed in U.S. homes today vanishes as standby power, when fully charged devices are left plugged in,” says Lauren Urbanek, senior energy policy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Instead of charging gadgets while you sleep—which means items stay plugged in long after they’re fully charged—give your tech just the right amount of juice during the day. Have kids make a chart or graph to figure out about how long it takes each device to drain, and how long it takes to charge back up. When it’s time to charge, set a timer and unplug the device as soon as it hits 100 percent.Slay vampires. Appliances that plug into outlets use power even when they’re on standby. These energy-sucking vampires usually have a light on, like the clock display on the microwave or DVD player, or the light on a game console. And don’t forget about sneaky suckers like blenders, coffee makers, TVs, and computer monitors. Challenge your kids to a spot-the-sucker game—and then unplug. Don’t want to keep pulling the plug? Use power strips for all your appliances, and put your kids in charge of remembering to turn off the whole thing.Power down. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, the average U.S. home blows through more than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of energy each year—the greenhouse gas equivalent of burning over 7,000 pounds of coal. So consider a weekly “Turn It All Off” day to minimize energy-depleting screen time. Read books instead of watching TV, swap video games for board games, and tell family stories instead of video chatting with friends. At night, take advantage of clearer skies (reduced air pollution!) to go for a family stargazing walk. (Check out this article for more screen-time alternatives.)Take the temp. Raise kids’ thermostat awareness. “The biggest energy users in your home tend to be heating and cooling systems,” Urbanek says. Thomas adds that turning up the thermostat by just one degree (or down in winter) could save 5 percent of the energy you’re using to cool or heat your home. To get kids in the spirit, play “How High Can You Go?” Turn up the thermostat one degree a day and see who’s willing to crank it up the next day. Even if your crew lasts only a few degrees, they’ll have made a difference for the planet.Shower tunes. By now you’ve probably drilled into your kids’ heads that singing “Happy Birthday” while washing their hands is just the right amount of time to help prevent infections. To reduce water waste, use that musical approach for showers as well. Have your kids each create a playlist between five and seven minutes long. The average shower lasts eight minutes, so shaving even just a minute off of your normal routine could save five gallons of water—almost as much that’s used during a dishwasher cycle. When that last song comes on, your kids will know it’s time for the final rinse.Greener plate. Cook home more isn't only healthier, but it’s also an opportunity to cut back on water waste by trying more plant-based meals. According to the United States Geological Survey, a quarter pound of burger meat takes 460 gallons of water to make (water grows the crops that feed the cattle), but one plant-based burger only requires about 60 gallons of water. To add more veggies to your family’s plate, bring your kids to the farmers market or grocery store. Have each person pick a color and find as many of those foods as they can. (Grape ice pops don’t count!) Then give a day off dish-washing duty to whoever comes up with the next family-favorite veggie-based dinner.Rethink online orders. To reduce packaging waste on internet orders, save items in your cart until you’re ready to make a big order, then select the option to group your items together. This prevents your items from coming in individual boxes.Trash talk. Give each family member their own wastebasket for the week, and have them write down everything they throw away. (But not food scraps: Here’s how to compost them instead of trashing.) Then at the end of the week, see what everyone’s written down. Takeout utensils and condiment packets from to-go orders? Next time, ask the restaurant to nix the waste. (Here’s a pdf checklist to help kids write a letter to restaurants about plastic waste.) Paper napkins? Ask each of your kids to pick a fabric, then cut out squares to create reusable cloths.",
"Some of Rachel Tinker’s favorite childhood memories were made at family gravesites. Her parents’ recollections of relatives she’d never met, along with stories told by her grandparents, helped her see where she came from.Apparently, her kids want the same view. “Hey, Pawpaw, tell me an old story,” is a common request from 11-year-old Allen when he’s with Tinker’s dad. Through tales of his Huck Finn-like childhood adventures as well as tougher stories about lean times, Allen is learning about his family—and who he is.“It shows the kids they come from surviving stock,” Tinker says. “They’re going to make it no matter what hardships life throws at them.”Sharing family history through storytelling is hugely beneficial to kids and families, says Bruce Feiler, who collected hundreds of life stories for his new book Life Is In the Transitions. For one, it gives kids a sense that they’re part of bigger family narrative.“Sharing family stories with children lets them know that people around them, people they love, people they view as heroes, also underwent obstacles and overcame them,” he says. “Not just people in books and movies. People in their lives.”In his book The Secrets of Happy Families, Feiler cites Emory University research showing that kids with more knowledge of family history have higher self-esteem and self-confidence, fewer behavior problems, and lower levels of anxiety. That might be because family stories give children a stronger sense of connection and belonging, which boosts their well-being, according to child development expert Elaine Reese, who runs the Story Lab at New Zealand’s University of Otago.Family stories show children that they’re not alone—and that might help them later in life. “When these children encounter difficulties, they appear to be better equipped to overcome adversity,” says Reese, who has researched family stories for over 30 years as a professor of developmental psychology in the United States and New Zealand. “From their bank of family stories, perhaps they’re even able to draw upon a similar experience that happened to someone they know and love.”Sparking a kid’s interest in family stories is easier than you might think. Children—especially between the ages of 5 and 12—are primed to listen to fictional stories from their parents. Real-life family stories are no different. “When they hear some, they usually beg for more, or ask for repeats of favorites,” Reese says.Good times to tell family stories together are at meals, on walks and rides, and on special occasions like birthdays and holidays. “Children love to hear their birth stories on their birthday each year,” says Reese, who wrote Tell Me a Story: Sharing Stories to Enrich Your Child’s World. “Although most would prefer you leave out the gory bits.”If you don’t have a ready supply of family stories, start creating one. Try these family-tested ideas from the experts.Interview elders: Encourage children to ask grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives about kid-friendly topics, like their favorite childhood toys, the home where they lived as children, how they met their spouse, and the biggest event of their childhood, Feiler says. If possible, record the interviews to create a video keepsake, or request written replies to preserve the stories and the handwriting in a scrapbook.Play whose story is it? Reese suggests writing a family history clue on one side of an index card. (For example, This person’s high school nickname was Cannonball because he could throw a baseball really fast and hard.) Write the answer on the other side. Take turns reading and guessing, and continue to add index cards as the years go by.Grow a family tree: Use tools like the National Geographic Kids Guide to Genealogy to create a family tree, showing kids how they’re connected to extended family. Then enhance all the facts and figures with funny or adventurous stories about those relatives that children can engage with.“The science of human memory tells us that facts and figures—Great-Grandma Adele was born in 1887 in Key West—aren’t remembered as well as a story about an actual event from that person’s life, such as the time Great-Grandma’s pony got caught eating sugar cubes in the pantry,” Reese says.Go on an heirloom scavenger hunt: When kids choose a family treasure on a shelf, wall, or attic, an adult then explains its origin story, Feiler says. (To keep keepsakes safe, set some ground rules, like “point but don’t touch,” before unleashing kids on their quest.)Build family stories together: “At the dinner table, start a story about your most recent family vacation,” Reese says. “Each person repeats the previous person’s bit, then adds more to the story: ‘We made the campfire,’ … ‘We made the campfire, and then we made s’mores.’” Parents: You might need to help connect events or create a positive ending.Share relevant stories from your childhood: For instance, if your child didn’t make the competitive soccer team, share how disappointed you were when you got passed over for the top basketball team, then ended up making friends and having fun on the B team. “Keep these stories short and dramatic, and avoid preaching,” Reese says.Host an autobiography night: Feiler suggests occasionally turning family dinners into intentional-storytelling sessions by having everyone tell a personal story. To keep things low-pressure, ask everyone before dinner to prepare a three-minute tale.Dish out food memories: While baking or cooking with kids, share bites of family culinary history, such as your favorite foods as a kid, who taught you how to cook, and aromas you remember from your grandparent’s kitchen.Take a virtual tour: Use Google Street View for a show-and-tell look at family landmarks, such as your parents’ childhood homes, your elementary school, and the church in Italy where your immigrant great-grandparents got married.",

"Favorite books that have inspired journeys are set in places ranging from Antarctica to Peru.It started with an ancient capital buried in the jungles of Peru. In April 2008, a few National Geographic Traveler staffers met over lunch to discuss The Lost City, by Henry Shukman, a novel that evokes the northern Peruvian wilds and one adventurer’s quest to uncover a forgotten citadel. That lunchtime journey proved so fascinating that, ever since, we’ve been traveling together via the magic carpet of stories.We meet every six weeks or so, and the group is open to anyone at National Geographic interested in books that inspire you to pack your bags or that reveal a place you might never get to. We read fiction, narrative nonfiction, thrillers, memoirs, essays, even “children’s literature.” We wandered from Australia and Brazil to Ukraine and Venice—all in the National Geographic spirit of learning about the world and everything in it.We begin our 100th book this month (see what we’re reading at the end of this story). These are some of our favorite reads from the past 12 years.Eighty Days: Nellie Bly and Elizabeth Bisland’s History-Making Race Around the World, by Matthew Goodman. Turns out journalist Nellie Bly, in 1889, had a competitor for her stunt round-the-world trip in the fastest time. Elizabeth Bisland, a reporter for a rival newspaper, departed New York on the same day as Bly, going in the opposite direction. Goodman’s true tale of these trailblazing women is an exhilarating (and exhausting) read.Gods of Jade and Shadow, by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. A spirited young woman from a small town in the Yucatán and a Maya god of the dead make an odd couple in this legend-filled Mexican odyssey. After reading this novel, Nat Geo Travel associate editor Brooke Sabin says, “I knew to seek out a cenote and look for a portal to the underworld on my recent trip to the Yucatán.”Travels With Charley, by John Steinbeck. A dog proves to be the best companion in Steinbeck’s classic 1962 travelogue of his trip around the U.S. meeting fellow Americans and reflecting on the state of the nation.The Black Penguin, by Andrew Evans. Fulfilling a lifelong dream, Evans undertakes the ultimate road trip: 12,000 miles in a month from Nat Geo headquarters, in Washington, D.C., to Antarctica—almost entirely by public transport.A Hole in the Wind, by David Goodrich. A climate scientist bikes across the U.S. from Delaware to Oregon, noting the effects of climate change on communities. Goodrich’s story helped Dustin Renwick, senior program officer for Nat Geo storytelling grants, see wind in a new way: “He lends physical presence to a force we perceive but never directly observe.”Don’t Let’s Go To the Dogs Tonight, by Alexandra Fuller. “Several years ago, I convinced my fiancé to go to Zimbabwe for our honeymoon. This book is the reason why,” says Nat Geo finance director Jeannette Swain. “Fuller’s memoir of growing up in (now) Zimbabwe is beautiful, haunting, and captivating. Despite hardships, her love for her family and Africa is as large as the continent itself.”Wild, by Cheryl Strayed. Strayed finds her best self while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. With her candor and willingness to be vulnerable, she inspired us to believe we could hike it too.The Woman Who Fell From the Sky, by Jennifer Steil. Here was a book about a place none of us knew much about, beyond the occasional news headline: Yemen. During a year teaching a journalism class and editing an English-language newspaper in Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, Steil brings us along as she hangs out at a pool party with Yemeni girlfriends, deals with prejudice from her male colleagues—and falls in love.Without You, There is No Us, by Suki Kim. A compelling account of Kim’s stint teaching English at a North Korean university, this memoir “provided insight on a place I’m unlikely to ever visit,” says former Nat Geo Channels researcher Rachael Jackson.Where’d You Go, Bernadette, by Maria Semple. A scalpel-wit satire about the insular world of Seattle’s Microsoft elite veers into unexpected territory when architect and private-school mom Bernadette suddenly takes off for Antarctica without telling anyone.The Matchmaker of Périgord, by Julia Stuart. “This was possibly the book I enjoyed the most,” says Jackson, “for its delightful, rhythmic writing and depiction of a whimsical little town in rural France. The images stayed with me: the woman who wore fancy dresses shorn off at the knee, the two men who had a tradition of trying to “out-picnic” each other. I passed it along to my husband and we still quote those men at their picnics: ‘Are you feeling peckish?’”Crazy Rich Asians, by Kevin Kwan. Super-wealthy Singaporeans throw parties, plan a wedding, go shopping, indulge in multicourse feasts—and we loved every over-the-top minute of it.A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles. We know who we’d want as our desert-island companion: Count Alexander Rostov. He can’t leave Moscow’s Metropol hotel without risking death, yet he spins a whole world out of his posh prison and finds humor, love, and family.The Library Book, by Susan Orlean. Delving into the mystery of the 1986 Los Angeles Public Library fire, the largest library fire in U.S. history, Orlean goes deep into the stacks at the type of place many of us consider heaven. “I really enjoyed this book, for obvious reasons,” says Nat Geo library director Maggie Turqman.The Geography of Bliss, by Eric Weiner. Traveling from Bhutan to Qatar to Asheville, North Carolina, Weiner searches for the kernels of truth in all those Happiest Places lists.Behind the Beautiful Forevers, by Katherine Boo. In Mumbai, slums lie in the shadows of glass-covered luxury hotels and office towers. Boo shows the spectrum of hope and despair in one particular slum, Annawadi, which is hidden from a city highway behind a concrete wall plastered in an ad for Italian tile that reads “Beautiful Forever.”All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr. Simply beautiful writing and a gripping narrative set in WWII France had us turning pages and biting our nails.The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. Cora escapes the brutality of the antebellum South on an actual underground railroad. Each stop on her journey rings with truth despite (or because of) Whitehead’s disruptions of time, space, and history.The Shadow of the Wind, by Carlos Ruiz Zafón. “Many of the book-club reads have been page-turners, but this one became an obsession for me,” says Sabin. “Zafón treats his native Barcelona like a character, detailing its many moods and dark corners. On recent trips to the city, I’ve used the book’s settings as inspiration to explore evocative, less-touristed spots like the medieval Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar and the hilltop Tibidabo, with its old-fashioned amusement park and views stretching from city to sea.”Our 100th book: Meet Me at the Museum, by Anne Youngson, which shuttles between Denmark and England.

"Cenotes, like this one in Tulum, dot Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. These entrances to the Maya underworld also offer spectacular snorkeling and surreal swimming.Though perhaps most known for tourist-packed Cancún, Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula also holds tens of thousands of beautiful, overlooked cenotes. For the ancient Maya, these natural, freshwater sinkholes had deep spiritual significance. An important water source, they were also a mystical threshold between this world and the underworld, marked with sacrifices of pottery, jewelry, and occasionally human beings. Today, many double as swimming spots popular with locals—and often unknown to tourists. (See the discovery of the world’s largest underwater cave.)Brimming with history, these four cenotes are worth the trip to take the plunge (or at least a few photos). Explore them while supporting local and indigenous businesses—and, as regional tourism increases, leave no trace on the rich environment.Why go: Find the region’s most famous Maya ruins in the archaeological zone Chichén Itzá, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Alongside El Castillo, a 98-foot-tall step pyramid topped by a temple, lies Cenote Sagrado, where archaeologists have found the remains of people who were probably sacrificed to the rain god. Because it’s a sacred site, swimming isn’t allowed, but photography is so pack a camera (and a sun hat). (See amazing pictures of the Yucatán’s Maya-temple-dwelling bats.)Getting there: Foreigners pay 480 pesos (about $25 USD) to enter Chichén Itzá. Nearby hotels tend to be overpriced, so fly into Mérida or Cancún and stay in charming, historic Valladolid (which also has 15 public cenotes). At Hotel Posada San Juan, beds are accompanied by hammocks so guests can sleep like Yucatecans. Eat like one too: Taste zik’il pak (a light, hummus-like pumpkin seed spread) at Yerbabuena del Sisal.Why go: This 53-foot-deep, 150-foot-wide cenote is so named because taxis drivers used to pull off the road there to—you guessed it—wash their cars. Today, the taxistas have given way to snorkelers and cave divers enjoying this little-touristed swimming hole. Bring your own snorkel gear to spot colorful fish, turtles, and maybe even—from a safe distance—a crocodile. (Read about the search for the lost empire of the Maya.)Water lilies reach for the sun in the Car Wash Cenote, where visitors can snorkel and explore for a $2.50 entrance fee.Getting there: Fly to Cancún and stay at Tulum’s Mi Amor Hotel to take advantage of their regional excursions, including an archaeologist-led trip to Maya ruins. The Car Wash cenote is a 15-minute taxi ride from the hotel, and costs 50 pesos (about $2.50 USD) to enter. Afterward, follow locals’ example and fuel up on tacos al pastor, aguas frescas, and empanadas at no-frills El Rincón Chiapaneco.Why go: Want to swim where the Empress of Mexico once did? An 18th-century plantation of henequen (an agave-like plant), Hacienda Mucuyché is home to two cenotes that supposedly hosted Carlota, a Belgian princess who briefly became Empress of Mexico when Napoleon III named her husband emperor. Tour the historic hacienda with a personal guide, then snorkel and float on the canal that connects the two cenotes.Getting there: Hacienda Mucuyché is a perfect day trip from Mérida, capital of the state of Yucatán and host to its own airport. Stay at Chablé Resort & Spa, a magical old hacienda that makes you feel as though you’re deep in the jungle, then rent a car for the scenic, 45-minute drive to Mucuyché and pay 450 pesos (about $24 USD) to enter. Explore all day before popping into the on-site restaurant for regional cuisine like conchinita pibil, a traditional braised pork dish.Why go: In the 1500s, fearless warrior Nachi Cocom led the Cocomes Maya people in resistance to the Spanish. According to local legend, he once took refuge from conquistadores in the Seven Cenotes of San Gerónimo, hiding out for several days before emerging to stalk his attackers. He was later forced to surrender, taking the name Juan upon his conversion to Christianity, but his bravery lives on in stories told on tours of the fabled cenotes. (This Maya ritual cave, “untouched” for 1,000 years, stunned archaeologists.)Getting there: The Seven Cenotes are less than an hour by car from Mérida. Book a daylong guided tour ($119 USD for adults): You’ll bike, snorkel, and learn about Mayan history, with a break for a lunch of poc chuc, a Yucatecan delicacy prepared with grilled meat and citrus.",
"A spectral bat in a cage targets a laboratory mouse in leaf litter on a table. Scientists studying these carnivorous bats in Mexico haven’t yet seen them take prey in the wild, so they film them and record sounds related to the pursuit.They hang from the cold, stone ceiling of an ancient Maya temple like a bunch of fuzzy grayfruits, staring down at us witheyes that shine golden in the red glow of our headlamps.The toothy, hungry bats have long, nearly transparent bunny-like ears and wrinkled, wolfy faces with a lance-shaped nose leaf—an appendage that bats use for echolocation—on top of their snouts.These mysterious bats just outside the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, in the Yucatán Peninsula, don’t roost in the thousands like some other species, said Rodrigo Medellín, the country’s leading expert on the flying mammals and a professor at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. “They’re always in these small groups—they’re very protective of one another.”Medellín swung his butterfly net at one of the six bats, catching it. He held the animal in a leather-gloved hand so we could examine the bat’s thick, woolly fur, which made it look sweet and cuddly, and its protruding snout and sharp teeth, which made it look anything but. This was a female, and she chattered her jaws at us, protesting. Medellín gently stretched out one of her wings and pointed to the bat’s thumb, which curved out from the edge. It was armed with a pronounced claw, shaped like a saber and just as sharp.“That’s what they use to lock their prey,” he said. From the size of this weapon, you know these hunters of the night aren’t slashing mosquitoes—they’re after rodents, songbirds, even other bats.Carnivorous bats, known collectively as false vampire bats because they don’t drink the blood of animals, as true vampire bats do, are found throughout the tropics, although in low numbers: Less than one percent of all bat species eat other vertebrates.Two species are found from southern Mexico to Bolivia and Brazil, with one even extending farther south into parts of Paraguay and Argentina: the woolly false vampire bat (the ones in the Maya temple) and the spectral bat, also called Linnaeus’s false vampire bat. The latter are the largest of the New World bats, some with wings spanning up to three feet. Threats to their rain forest habitats are putting pressure on Mexico’s bats—and adding urgency to efforts to understand their ways.Little is known about woolly false vampire bats, so Medellín caught all six and brought them outside the temple in soft, white cotton bags to weigh and measure them. Four were male, and two female, one pregnant. To learn more about the bats’ relationships, the researchers punched out a tiny skin sample from one wing of each bat to send to a laboratory for genetic analysis. Small GPS tracking devices were attached to the backs of three of the bats (including the pregnant female) to provide information about their hunting habits.“Look,” Medellín said, pulling a male from a bag and turning him on his back. “The males have tiny testicles—that correlates with monogamy.” In the animal world, monogamy is rare. “It could be that two of these males are the females’ mates, and the other two are their offspring from last year and are in the process of becoming independent,” he explained. One female was nursing a four-month-old pup, and the pregnant one’s swollen belly indicated that she would give birth soon.On the floor of the bats’ room was the partially eaten carcass of a spiny pocket mouse. “Look at that—a fresh meal, and probably the last prey of the night,” Medellín said. “We think they eat some prey outside, and after they’re full, they bring the last one back.” The catch often goes to bats that may not be able to hunt, such as nursing mothers. “We want to know what time they leave their roost, where they go, who feeds whom, and who they travel with,” he said.Clues to the bats’ diets were gleaned from dinner leftovers and feces in the temple. “Look,” Medellín exclaimed again, holding up the tiny, decaying carcass of the juvenile mouse. “I’m surprised they didn’t eat it all, because usually they eat every bit—even the bones, toenails, and tail, sometimes.” They’d also eaten a yellow butterfly, forgoing the wings; a cicada; and a bird, possibly a woodcreeper, judging from a cluster of russet feathers. “Usually we find the wings of other bats.” They eat a lot of one uncommon species that is difficult to find. Medellín is now studying why this species is highly favored and how the woolly false vampires find them.According to Medellín, woolly and spectral bats “are likely the bats described in the Maya origin myth, Popol Vuh.” In that tale the Maya hero twins are placed inside a “bat house”—a cave filled with death bats, called Camazotz by the Maya. The bats had snouts like blades, which they used to kill people and animals. To escape, the twins crawled inside their blowguns, and all night long the bats terrorized them. Toward dawn, one of the twins said he would check to see if it was safe to leave. He raised his head out of his gun—and promptly had it cut off by a Camazotz.“These bats do the same thing,” Medellín said. “They stalk their prey, land on them with half-spread wings, locking them with the thumb claws, and deliver a death bite to the back or top of the head. Camazotz was not an invention.”All wings and ears, a woolly false vampire bat hangs from a branch before taking flight. The bats have a lance-shaped nose leaf—an appendage that bats use for echolocation—on top of their snouts.Like wolves, lions, most bird species, and some cetaceans, insects, and primates—including us—woolly and spectral bats share food, but only with their roost mates. Scientists consider food sharing to be a sign of altruism, although the behavior is most often found among animals that are closely related to one another—and then it’s more indicative of a close genetic relationship than a kind heart. Giving food to individuals outside of one’s genetic relatives, as humans often do, is seldom seen in other species. That’s another reason Medellín and his students want to clarify the genetic relationships among the woolly bats. They know the bats are bringing prey back to their temple roost (“It’s the soft side of their nature,” Medellín said), but they’re not yet sure which ones are sharing and which receiving. They expect to get answers from video recorders deployed in the roost by Ivar Vleut, Medellín’s postdoctoral researcher, to capture footage of feedings.Vleut played some food-sharing clips for me on his laptop. “You can see the mother with her pup hanging here, and now another bat has arrived with a mouse,” he said. The bat, most likely one of the males, flies in and roosts close to her, grabbing an overhead beam with his feet. Hanging upside down, she shakes her furry forearms at him much as a baby bird does when begging from its parents. She bites the prey and removes it from the hunter; the mouse is already missing its head, which the male probably ate. Grasping the mouse’s body by its neck and chewing vigorously, she devours everything but the tail, which drops to the floor. The hunter bat hangs quietly beside her, grooming his wings by licking them. “That’s the usual behavior,” Vleut said. “They often seem to be full, satiated, when they return, which is why we think they’ve been hunting for a while and then bring back their last catch to share.”This ancient Maya temple near Mexico’s Calakmul Biosphere Reserve is home to six woolly false vampire bats. Unlike many other species, these bats roost in groups of between four and eight, not en masse, according to the scientists.The scientists have yet to see the bats hunting in the wild, but they have a good idea of their technique because Medellín kept two woolly false vampire males captive for two weeks in his hotel room and let them hunt for mice he released. He scattered leaves for the rodents to rustle through, sounds the bats quickly detected as they rotated their giant ears like satellite dishes to target their prey. “The bats flew inside a cage and hung from its wire sides or a branch,” Medellín said, “and just stayed there, perfectly still. But as soon as they heard the tiniest sound from the mice, they pounced.” The bats were easy to train, he added, quickly learning that a certain sound on his cell phone meant they’d soon have a chance to hunt. Medellín suspects that woolly bats in the wild hang out on tree trunks when hunting, listening for the scuttling footsteps of rodents or reptiles, or the sound of another bat’s wings.One day we trekked through the rain forest hoping to find spectral bats. Vleut had first encountered one in 2009. “They’re very rare, and I knew nothing about them,” he said as we hiked along a trail. Once he trapped a spectral in a net while doing a bat survey. “I smelled it before I saw it—I thought something had died in our net. I was completely confounded, without words, when I saw this giant creature chewing his way out of our net. I was so surprised and a bit scared because of its size.” After removing the bat from the net, Vleut put on two pairs of leather gloves to handle it.Fascinated, Vleut read everything he could find about the bats—which was very little—and discovered that no one had looked into their ecology. He contacted Medellín, and the two launched their study. “Right now we’re trying to determine how many of these bats can live in an area,” Vleut said. “We give rewards to people who find their roosts and tell us.”A woolly false vampire bat is released after having a GPS tracker removed. The device helps researchers like Ivar Vleut study the elusive bats’ movements and ecology.That was how they’d located several roosts. They found another one after netting a spectral bat and attaching a transmitter to its back. Our group followed the signal to a hollow tree, where Medellín and Vleut hoped to be able to observe spectral bats at home. The scientists attached a GoPro camera to a cable. Vleut fixed a set of ropes and carried the camera to the uppermost part of the trunk, where the hollow opened. He slipped the camera inside and inched it farther down.For several minutes the computer monitor on the ground was dark. Then: “We see them! There they are! Look, look! Right there!” Three pairs of eyes shone in the camera’s light, an adult female with a juvenile and an adult male. Surprised by the strange intruder in their home, they were protesting. We couldn’t hear their sounds, but the bats’ faces were contorted, their teeth chattering furiously, their long ears vibrating.A woolly false vampire bat flaps into a moonlit night. The mission: Get dinner. For rodents and other small creatures of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, the night is an especially dangerous time, as meat-eating bats leave their roosts seeking prey.“They do that when they make the burrrr sound, which tells you to back off,” said Medellín, who kept his eyes fixed on the screen. “Now what’s that down there?” he said, looking past the bats at what appeared to be the floor of the tree’s interior. “That’s a bat’s wing!” one of his students replied. It was the remains of a recent meal, perhaps, lying there like part of a discarded Halloween costume. The bats continued to glare and chatter at the GoPro, and finally in what was surely a desperate protective gesture, one of the adults turned and spread its wings around the pup.“Ohhh,” we said in unison, and then: “Take the camera out—get it out of there!” Vleut pulled on the cable, and the bats disappeared from the screen. An animated discussion ensued about how the scientists might put an unobtrusive camera into the tree to get images of the lives of bats without disturbing them.Undoubtedly these carnivorous bats were terrifying to the Maya, just as they must be today to the animals they hunt. But we saw their softer, vulnerable side when they were huddled in their roosts or being handled by the scientists. Strange-looking creatures—a winged mix of mouse and wolf—as gentle and caring of their own as any other mammal.",
"The ancient city of Holmul isn’t much to look at. To the casual observer it’s just a series of steep, forested hills in the middle of the jungle in northern Guatemala, near the Mexican border. The jungle here in the Petén Basin is thick and warm but drier than you might expect. And silent, except for the drum of cicadas and the occasional calls of howler monkeys.Take a closer look, and you may notice that most of these hills are arranged in massive rings, like travelers huddled around a fire on a cold night. An even closer look reveals that parts of the hills are made of cut stone, and some have tunnels carved into their sides. In fact they’re not hills at all but ancient pyramids, left to decay after the collapse of the Maya civilization a millennium ago.The site was a thriving settlement during the Classic Maya period (A.D. 250-900), a time when writing and culture flourished throughout what is today Central America and southern Mexico. But it also was a time of political upheaval: Two warring city-states were locked in perennial conflict, grappling for supremacy. For a brief period one of those city-states prevailed and became the closest thing to an empire in Maya history. It was ruled by the Snake kings of the Kaanul dynasty, which until just a few decades ago no one even knew existed. Thanks to sites around this city-state, including Holmul, archaeologists are now piecing together the story of the Snake kings.Holmul isn’t a big, famous site like nearby Tikal, and it was mostly ignored by archaeologists until 2000, when Francisco Estrada-Belli arrived. An Italian-born Guatemalan, he’s ruggedly handsome with scruffy hair and a relaxed demeanor. He wasn’t looking for anything fancy, such as Classic-era written tablets or ornate burials—just some insight into the roots of the Maya. One of the first things he found was a building a few miles from what appeared to be Holmul’s central cluster of pyramids. In it were the remnants of a mural portraying soldiers on a pilgrimage to a faraway place.Oddly, parts of the mural had been destroyed, apparently by the Maya themselves, as if they’d wanted to erase the history it depicted. Hoping to understand why, Estrada-Belli tunneled into several nearby pyramids. Ancient Mesoamericans built their pyramids in stages, one on top of the other, like Russian nesting dolls. When the people of Holmul added a new layer, they preserved the one beneath, which has allowed researchers to tunnel in and see previous structures almost exactly as they were left.In 2013 Estrada-Belli and his team worked their way into one of the larger pyramids, tracing an ancient staircase to the entrance of a ceremonial building. Climbing up through a hole in the floor, they discovered a 26-foot-long frieze, marvelously preserved, above the entrance to an ancient tomb.Stucco friezes are very rare and fragile. This one depicted three men, including a Holmul king, rising from the mouths of strange monsters flanked by underworld creatures, entwined by two giant, feathered serpents. The artwork was iconic and strikingly vibrant.As Estrada-Belli gazed at the frieze, he noticed a series of carvings at the bottom. Kneeling down, he saw a ribbon of characters, or glyphs, listing the kings of Holmul. Near the center was a glyph that he knew at once was the most electrifying discovery of his career: a grinning snake.“Among the various glyphs, I saw the [name of the] Kaanul,” he says. “Before this we were anonymous; Holmul was anonymous. And then, all of a sudden, we were in the middle of the most exciting part of Maya history.”The story of the discovery of the Kaanul, or Snakes, and their effort to create an empire begins in Tikal, the city of their most hated enemy. Just as Tikal dominated the Maya lowlands for centuries, it has dominated Maya archaeology since the 1950s. The sprawling city once had a population approaching 60,000, and its elegant buildings surely dazzled visitors in A.D. 750, much as they do tourists today.It also had hundreds of beautifully carved tombstone-like blocks called stelae. Using the inscriptions on them, scientists reconstructed Tikal’s history until its fall in the ninth century. But there was an odd gap—roughly from 560 to 690—when no stelae were carved and little else was built. Baffled by this 130-year break, archaeologists called it the Tikal hiatus and chalked it up as a mystery of the ancient Maya.Archaeologists began filling in the gap in the 1960s, when they noticed an odd glyph scattered around various Classic sites—a snake head with a clownish grin and surrounded by markings associated with royalty. In 1973 archaeologist Joyce Marcus recognized it as an emblem glyph—words for a city and ruling title that served as a sort of coat of arms. She wondered if it could be related to the Tikal hiatus. What if some unknown warriors had conquered the city? If they had, where would such a force have come from, and wouldn’t archaeologists be familiar with it?The jungles of the Petén are hot and parched in the dry season and nearly impassable in the wet season. They’re infested with poisonous plants and insects and menaced by armed drug runners. Nevertheless Marcus explored them for months, visiting ruins and collecting photos of glyphs. Everywhere she went, she saw references to the grinning snake, especially around the ancient city of Calakmul, in what’s now Mexico, near its southern border.“These satellite sites were mentioning this city in the center. So in that way it was kind of like a black hole,” Marcus says. “It was the hub of a network of sites around it that were equidistant from Calakmul.”When she got to Calakmul, whose two central pyramids were easily visible from the air, she was amazed by its size—roughly 50,000 people once lived there. Stelae were strewn everywhere, but most of them were blank. The limestone was so soft that centuries of erosion had wiped them clean. She found only two snake glyphs in the city.The mystery of the snakes prompted a young British researcher, Simon Martin, to assemble all the information he could about the snake glyphs from Calakmul and smaller sites. He used hints of battles and political intrigue from around the Maya world to form a picture of the Snakes and their dynasty.“We only really know about Tikal from Tikal. Whereas in Calakmul’s case, we know about them from everybody else,” Martin says. “It just sort of coalesced out of the mist. Little by little the significance of all these random appearances began to point in the same direction.”Eventually Martin and archaeologist Nikolai Grube published a book called Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens, which described the intertwining histories of the kingdoms of the ancient Maya world. At the center of that world, for one shining century, were the Snakes. Like Marcus, Martin says the Snake kingdom was a sort of black hole—one that sucked in all the cities around it and created what might have been a Maya empire. Of course there are still many questions about the Snakes: how they lived, ruled, and fought—and even whether some of them were real.At the end of the fifth century, Tikal was one of the most powerful city-states in the region. Archaeologists suspect that it held its position with the help of a much larger city high in the mountains 650 miles to the west called Teotihuacan, near today’s Mexico City. For centuries these two cities shaped Maya painting, architecture, pottery, weapons, and city planning. But all that changed in the sixth century, when Teotihuacan disengaged from the Maya region, leaving Tikal to fend for itself.Enter the Snakes. No one’s sure where they came from; there’s no evidence of them ruling Calakmul before 635. Some experts imagine them hundreds of years before the Classic era, moving from place to place, creating one megacity after another. But this is guesswork. The first obvious snake glyphs seem to appear in Dzibanché, a city in southern Mexico, 80 miles northeast of Calakmul.Wherever the Snakes were based, we know that starting in the early sixth century two successive Snake kings recognized that Tikal was vulnerable and made a bold play for political control. The first, Stone Hand Jaguar, spent decades making courtesy calls throughout the Maya lowlands.These visits might seem innocuous now—orchestrating a wedding, playing an ancient Maya ball game (a sport involving a ball, several sticks, and stone hoops), perhaps just dropping by to say hello. But this was how conquest often happened in the Maya world—by offering gifts, paying respects, building crucial allies. No one seems to have been better at this than the Snakes.Soon Tikal’s southeastern ally, Caracol, was siding with the Snakes, as was Waka, a warlike city to the west. The Snakes patiently gathered the loyalty of other cities to the north, east, and west of Tikal, forming a giant pincer to squeeze their foe. Stone Hand Jaguar and his allies were finally ready to make their move on Tikal, but the Snake lord died before his political maneuvers could pay off. It fell to his successor (and perhaps son), Sky Witness, to spring the trap. The young king must have cut an impressive figure. Scientists who’ve examined his remains say he was powerfully built and that his skull was battered from untold battles, with scars on top of previous scars.According to inscriptions on an altar in Caracol, Sky Witness put an end to Tikal’s reign on April 29, 562. The king put all the pieces in place, then struck. He led the Snake army east from Waka, while forces from Caracol, the nearby city-state of Naranjo, and probably Holmul moved west.The Snakes and their allies quickly crushed Tikal, sacked it, and likely sacrificed its king with a stone blade on his own altar. It’s probably at this time that the people of Holmul nearly destroyed the mural that Estrada-Belli would find more than 1,400 years later—which honors Tikal and Teotihuacan—as a sign of loyalty to their new Snake lords. The reign of the Snakes had begun.The next 30 years of Maya history are a bit fuzzy. Thanks to Mexican archaeologists Enrique Nalda and Sandra Balanzario, we know that Sky Witness died 10 years after his victory, when he was in his early 30s. In 2004 they uncovered a series of tombs in a pyramid at Dzibanché in which they found a bone needle used for blood rituals amid jade masks, obsidian, and pearls under a thick coating of cinnabar dust. Markings along one side of the needle read, “This is the blood offering of Sky Witness.” Of the eight Snake kings who ruled during Tikal’s hiatus, he’s one of just two whose remains have been found.The next time the Snakes appeared was far to the west, in the lavish city of Palenque. Unlike the drier lowland metropolises of Tikal and Calakmul, Palenque was refined and sophisticated, its elegant stucco-covered pyramids and watchtower nestled in the foothills of the mountains that led to the Gulf of Mexico and the central highlands. Thanks to its ample rivers and waterfalls, it had plenty of water and even may have had toilets with running water.It wasn’t a big city—maybe 10,000 people—but it was a beacon of civilization and a gateway for trade to the west, a prime target for an ambitious young power. The Snakes were led then by a king named Scroll Serpent who, like his predecessors, invaded using proxies and allies. Palenque’s queen, Heart of the Windy Place, defended her city against the Snake onslaught but surrendered on April 21, 599.Such expansionist impulses were rare among the Classic Maya, who often are described as quarrelsome and disjointed, focused on their territories without larger ambitions. The Snakes were different.“The attack on Palenque was part of a larger plan,” says Guillermo Bernal, an epigraphist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “I don’t think the reasons were material in nature—they were ideological. The Kaanul envisioned creating an empire.”The idea of empire building is controversial among Maya archaeologists. For many the concept is culturally and geographically implausible. Still, looking at the Snakes, it’s hard not to see a pattern of expansion. They made allies of the biggest cities to the east, conquered those to the south, and traded with people to the north. Palenque represented the edge of the Maya world to the west. Yet without horses and standing armies, how could they hold it?Influencing such a far-flung region, perhaps as large as the U.S. state of Kentucky, required a kind of organization never before seen among the Maya. It also required a new seat of power, one closer to the jade-rich cities in the south. Dzibanché was almost 100 miles from Calakmul, an impressive distance for people on foot in thick jungle. There are no records of the move to the new capital of Calakmul, but in 635 the Snakes erected a monument declaring themselves the masters of the city, having displaced a dynasty there known as the Bats.Within a year the greatest of the Snake rulers—perhaps the greatest Maya king ever—took the throne. His name was Yuknoom Cheen II, or Shaker of Cities, as he is sometimes called. Sky Witness and Scroll Serpent had been adept conquerors, but Yuknoom Cheen was a true king. Like Cyrus in Persia or Augustus in Rome, he deftly played one city against another—bribing some, threatening others—while consolidating his hold on the Maya lowlands unlike any Maya king before or after. And he kept up this political balancing act for 50 years.The best way to understand a king can be to meet his servant. Similarly, the best way to understand an empire is often to look at a client city. Perhaps the most interesting servant to the Snakes was a small, otherwise unremarkable city called Saknikte.In a sense, archaeologists discovered the site twice. By the early 1970s they’d come across a series of stone panels circulating on the black market. Gorgeously crafted with intricate texts, the panels had been looted by thieves and sold abroad with no way to trace their origin. Sprinkled among them were glyphs of a grinning snake. Archaeologists named the unknown place where the looters had found them Site Q.Site Q became a sort of Ark of the Covenant for archaeologists such as Marcello Canuto. One hot afternoon in April 2005 he accompanied researchers mapping a site nicknamed La Corona in the Petén jungle. Looking for ceramics to help date the site, he walked into a looter’s trench that sliced into a pyramid and saw a wallet-size patch of exposed carved stone on the wall. “I could see some squiggles on the rock,” Canuto says. “I sort of jumped back. ‘Whoa, did I just see what I think I just saw?’ Then I looked again, and I could see more than just squiggles—it was script.” Under layers of dirt and vegetation were the finest, most elegant carvings he’d ever seen in the field. “As soon as we cleared it off, we said, ‘This is Site Q.’ ”Canuto has been there ever since. Saknikte, the site’s Maya name, seems to have had a special status in the Snake kingdom. Its princes went to Calakmul for education, and three of them wedded Snake princesses. Unlike the martial city of Waka just to the south, Saknikte didn’t fight many battles. Its kings had peaceful names that translate roughly as Sunny Dog, White Worm, and Red Turkey. Panels tell of nobles drinking alcohol and playing flutes.According to carved panels found by Canuto’s team, Yuknoom Cheen paid a visit just before the Snake capital officially moved to Calakmul. The elegant portrait shows Yuknoom Cheen seated, looking relaxed, glancing off to the side as Saknikte’s king looks on.Saknikte wasn’t the only place where the Snakes were building influence. Yuknoom Cheen’s name appears throughout the Maya region. He married off his daughter Water Lily Hand to a Waka prince; she later became a powerful warrior queen. He installed new kings in Cancuén, to the south, and Moral-Reforma, nearly a hundred miles to the west. In Dos Pilas he conquered the brother of Tikal’s new king and turned him into a loyal vassal.He also established a new trade route on the western side of his kingdom, linking various allies. Scientists have noticed an oddity of these vassal cities. It seems that certain close allies didn’t have their own emblem glyphs, and their kings, though sumptuously adorned, didn’t use kingly titles once they fell in with the Snakes.Meanwhile, the Snake kings of Calakmul took on a more sweeping title: kaloomte. King of kings.“I think they changed the way politics were done. I think they created something fairly new,” says Tomás Barrientos, a Guatemalan archaeologist who co-manages the Saknikte site. “I personally see it as a breakthrough in Maya history.”All the while the Snakes kept their eye on their old enemy, Tikal, which repeatedly tried to rise up and take revenge. In 657, after shoring up his allies, Yuknoom Cheen and a nearby puppet king, an ambitious man named God That Hammers the Sky, struck Tikal. Two decades later Tikal rose up yet again, and the Snake king once more orchestrated its defeat, killing its king in the process.How was Tikal still able to threaten the seemingly omnipotent Snakes? Experts say Maya kings had to be careful when maintaining alliances and often left defeated kings alive. It could be that Classic Maya battles were mostly ceremonial. Or perhaps the allies of defeated kings—worried that their own throats could be next—pushed for mercy. Or maybe Maya kings typically didn’t have big enough armies to wipe out a city.Whatever the reason, Yuknoom Cheen played a delicate game of politics. Rather than hand over Tikal to his ally God That Hammers the Sky, he held a peace summit with Tikal’s new king. It was then that he introduced his successor (and likely son), Claw of Fire, who one day would inherit the kingdom. And ultimately lose it forever.Around the advanced age of 86, Yuknoom Cheen died. Most Calakmul citizens would have been lucky to live half as long, but their kings were a pampered breed, dining only on soft tamales, so that even their teeth looked unusually young. Malnutrition was pervasive in the poorer classes, but elites could be overweight and some may have had diabetes.Some suggest that Claw of Fire was just such a man. He likely was running the kingdom long before his father died. But as with the sons of many great kings, he fell far short of his father. Despite multiple crushing defeats, Tikal rose up again in 695. This time it was led by a young king, impressively named God That Clears the Sky. Claw of Fire raised another Snake army to face the Tikal upstart.We don’t know exactly what happened that August day. Some experts think that God That Hammers the Sky, bitter about various snubs, betrayed his Snake allies on the battlefield. Others say Claw of Fire, middle-aged and suffering from a painful spinal disease, didn’t inspire confidence in his troops. Perhaps the stars simply weren’t aligned.The Snakes were routed. A few years later, his rule in tatters, Claw of Fire died and took with him the dreams of a Snake empire. Most archaeologists say the Snakes never recovered but continued to wield influence. In 711 the Snakes’ strongest ally, Naranjo, declared it was still loyal to the Snakes, and 10 years later another Snake princess showed up at Saknikte.But by mid-century the Snakes had lost their bite. A Calakmul neighbor even erected a stela celebrating the return of the Bat kings that shows a warrior stomping on a snake. For the next century Tikal punished the city-states that had helped the Snakes—Waka, Caracol, Naranjo, and Holmul.The people of Saknikte, known as lovers not fighters, invited a Tikal princess to marry one of their nobles in 791. Yet Tikal would never attain the power reached by the Snakes, and by the mid-800s the Classic Maya were in collapse. Whether because of overpopulation, instability, or prolonged drought, the Classic cities fell into chaos and eventually were abandoned.Could the Snakes have prevented the collapse? What would have happened if Claw of Fire had beaten Tikal in 695?“I think the collapse could have been avoided,” says archaeologist David Freidel, who leads the excavations in Waka. “The failure to unite the central area of the Maya world under one government was a major factor in the descent into anarchy, endemic warfare, and vulnerability to drought.”Someday we may have the answer. Forty years ago the Snake kings were a rumor. Twenty years ago they were viewed merely as the masters of Calakmul. Today we know they ruled the largest and most powerful Maya kingdom ever.Such is the maddeningly slow work of archaeology. Through glimpses and snippets, experts try to cobble together a coherent picture of the past.And often the experts disagree. Ramón Carrasco, an archaeologist who oversees the Calakmul site, says the Snakes never lived in Dzibanché and never declined from glory. He’s worked alongside Simon Martin and other researchers and seen the same evidence, yet he’s come to different conclusions.And so archaeologists keep looking for clues. In 1996 Carrasco was excavating Calakmul’s largest structure, a graceful pyramid dating to before 300 B.C. Near the top, as he carefully cleaned and pulled up stones, he discovered the remains of a body. And below that, a chamber.“We lifted the lid, and we could see down,” says Carrasco, a distinguished-looking man with a gravelly voice from too many cigarettes. “We saw some bones and offerings and a lot of dust. It was like seeing the dust of time.”It took nine months to safely dig into the tomb and excavate it. When Carrasco finally got in, he knew that he’d found a powerful king. The body had been wrapped in a fine shawl and covered with beads. The king was not alone—a young woman and a child had been sacrificed and laid in a nearby chamber.The king’s body, Carrasco says, “was covered with mud and dust. You could see some jade beads, but you couldn’t see the mask.” So he pulled out a brush and began gently cleaning it. “The first thing I saw was an eye—looking at me from the past.”The eye was from a beautiful jade mask meant to honor the king in the afterlife. Later analysis showed that he was a portly man, perhaps even fat, with hardened ligaments in his spine. His tomb was elegantly ornamented.Nearby sat a headdress of jade, the center of which had once held the paw of a jaguar. Next to that was a ceramic dish with a grinning snake head and the inscription “Claw of Fire’s plate.”",
"National Geographic Explorer Guillermo de Anda examines a cache of ritual vessels inside the Balamku (Jaguar God) cave in Yucatán, Mexico. The objects have been untouched for at least 1,000 years.Archaeologists hunting for a sacred well beneath the ancient Maya city of Chichén Itzá on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula have accidentally discovered a trove of more than 150 ritual objects—untouched for more than a thousand years—in a series of cave chambers that may hold clues to the rise and fall of the ancient Maya. The discovery of the cave system, known as Balamku or “Jaguar God,” was announced by Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) in a press conference held today in Mexico City.After its initial discovery by farmers in 1966, Balamku was visited by archaeologist Víctor Segovia Pinto, who wrote up a report noting the presence of an extensive amount of archaeological material. But instead of excavating the site, Segovia then directed the farmers to seal up the entrance, and all records of the discovery of the cave seemed to vanish.Balamku remained sealed for more than 50 years, until it was reopened in 2018 by National Geographic Explorer Guillermo de Anda and his team of investigators from the Great Maya Aquifer Project during their search for the water table beneath Chichén Itzá. Exploration of the system was funded in part by a grant from the National Geographic Society.De Anda recalls pulling himself on his stomach through the tight tunnels of Balamku for hours before his headlamp illuminated something entirely unexpected: A cascade of offerings left by the ancient residents of Chichén Itzá, so perfectly preserved and untouched that stalagmites had formed around the incense burners, vases, decorated plates, and other objects in the cavern.See why archaeologists are exploring under an ancient pyramid for clues to the Maya underworld.“I couldn’t speak, I started to cry. I’ve analyzed human remains in [Chichén Itzá’s] Sacred Cenote, but nothing compares to the sensation I had entering, alone, for the first time in that cave,” says de Anda, who is an investigator with INAH and director of the Great Maya Aquifer Project, which seeks to explore, understand, and protect the aquifer of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.“You almost feel the presence of the Maya who deposited these things in there,” he adds.To access just the first of seven ritual offering chambers identified so far within Balamku, archaeologists must crawl flat on their stomachs through hundreds of feet of tortuously narrow passages. In the original report on the cave (recently located by archaeologist and GAM investigator James Brady of California State University, Los Angeles), Segovia identified 155 artifacts, some with faces of Toltec rain god Tláloc, and others with markings of the sacred ceiba tree, a potent representation of the Maya universe. In comparison, the nearby cave of Balankanché, a ritual site excavated in 1959, contains just 70 of these objects.“Balamku appears to be the ‘mother’ of Balankanché,” says de Anda. “I don’t want to say that quantity is more important than information, but when you see that there are many, many offerings in a cave that is also much more difficult to access, this tells us something.”Why Segovia would decide to seal up such a phenomenal discovery is still a matter of debate. But in doing so, he inadvertently provided researchers with an unprecedented “second chance” to answer some of the most perplexing questions that continue to stir controversy among Mayanists today, such as such as the level of contact and influence exchanged between different Mesoamerican cultures, and what was going on in the Maya world prior to the fall of Chichén Itzá.“For the ancient Maya, caves and cenotes [sinkoles] were considered openings to the underworld,” says Holley Moyes, a University of California, Merced expert on the archaeology and religious use of Maya caves who was not a part of the project. “They represent some of the most sacred spaces for the Maya, ones that also influenced site planning and social organization. They are fundamental, hugely important, to the Maya experience.”But until the concept of cave archaeology began to take shape in the 1980s, archaeologists were more interested in monumental architecture and intact artifacts than they were in analyzing the residues and materials found in and around objects. When Balankanché was excavated in 1959, caves were still mapped by hand in the dark and artifacts were routinely removed from their sites, cleaned, and later put back. Of all the incense burners found in Balankanché that were filled with material that could have provided definitive evidence related to the chronology of the site, for instance, only one was ever analyzed.Explore the world's largest underwater cave system in Yucatán, Mexico.Investigators of the Great Maya Aquifer Project see the (re)discovery of Balamku as a chance to implement a totally new model of cave archaeology, one that employs cutting-edge technology and specialized fields such as 3-D mapping and paleobotany. These new insights could give us a much more detailed idea of what was actually occurring in Maya cave rituals, as well as the history of the great city of Chichén Itzá, which declined for unknown reasons in the 13th century.“Balamku can tell us not only the moment of collapse of Chichén Itzá,” says de Anda. “It can also probably tell us the moment of its beginning. Now, we have a sealed context, with a great quantity of information, including useable organic matter, that we can use to understand the development of Chichén Itzá.”Further study of the site will also shed light on the intimate details of the catastrophic droughts that likely provoked the collapse of the Maya civilization. While this area has always been prone to drastic cycles of climate variability, some researchers have suggested that excessive deforestation in the Maya lowlands, which was once home to some 10-15 million people, could have exacerbated the problem and made the entire region uninhabitable.Understanding these past cycles can have an added benefit for modern life as well, says National Geographic archaeologist-in-residence Fredrik Hiebert. “By studying these caves and cenotes, it’s possible to learn some lessons for how to best use the environment today, in terms of sustainability for the future.”In this sense, de Anda believes archaeology has the potential to become a much more “useful” science.“It’s always been considered the opposite—a beautiful and interesting field of science, but without a great deal of utility,” he says. “I think that here, we will be able to demonstrate the contrary, because when we begin to understand these marvelous contexts, we can understand the footprints of humankind’s past, and what was happening on Earth during one of the most dramatic moments in history.”",
"Built to awe, the pyramid known as El Castillo has become the towering icon of Chichén Itzá.Site: Pre-Hispanic City of Chichén ItzáLocation: MexicoYear Designated: 1988Category: CulturalCriteria: (i)(ii)(iii)Reason: The brilliant ruins of Chichén Itzá evidence a dazzling ancient city that once centered the Maya empire in Central America.* * *The stepped pyramids, temples, columned arcades, and other stone structures of Chichén Itzá were sacred to the Maya and a sophisticated urban center of their empire from A.D. 750 to 1200.Viewed as a whole, the incredible complex reveals much about the Maya and Toltec vision of the universe—which was intimately tied to what was visible in the dark night skies of the Yucatán Peninsula.The most recognizable structure here is the Temple of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo. This glorious step pyramid demonstrates the accuracy and importance of Maya astronomy—and the heavy influence of the Toltecs, who invaded around 1000 and precipitated a merger of the two cultural traditions.The temple has 365 steps—one for each day of the year. Each of the temple’s four sides has 91 steps, and the top platform makes the 365th.Devising a 365-day calendar was just one feat of Maya science. Incredibly, twice a year on the spring and autumn equinoxes, a shadow falls on the pyramid in the shape of a serpent. As the sun sets, this shadowy snake descends the steps to eventually join a stone serpent head at the base of the great staircase up the pyramid’s side.The Maya’s astronomical skills were so advanced they could even predict solar eclipses, and an impressive and sophisticated observatory structure remains on the site today.This great city’s only permanent water source was a series of sinkhole wells. Spanish records report that young female victims were thrown into the largest of these, live, as sacrifices to the Maya rain god thought to live in its depths. Archaeologists have since found their bones, as well as the jewelry and other precious objects they wore in their final hours.Chichén Itzá's ball court is the largest known in the Americas, measuring 554 feet (168 meters) long and 231 feet (70 meters) wide. During ritual games here, players tried to hit a 12-pound (5.4-kilogram) rubber ball through stone scoring hoops set high on the court walls. Competition must have been fierce indeed—losers were put to death.Chichén Itzá was more than a religious and ceremonial site. It was also a sophisticated urban center and hub of regional trade. But after centuries of prosperity and absorbing influxes of other cultures like the Toltecs, the city met a mysterious end.During the 1400s people abandoned Chichén Itzá to the jungle. Though they left behind amazing works of architecture and art, the city’s inhabitants left no known record of why they abandoned their homes. Scientists speculate that droughts, exhausted soils, and royal quests for conquest and treasure may have contributed to Chichén Itzá's downfall.Recently this World Heritage site was accorded another honor. In a worldwide vote Chichén Itzá was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.Chichén Itzá is located near the small town of Piste. Bus services connect to the international airports at Mérida (under two hours) and Cancun (two and a half hours).The ruins are open daily. Chichén Itzá's climate is consistently tropical—average temperatures are 93ºF (34ºC). Spring and autumn equinoxes offer the chance to see the incredible shadow serpent of El Castillo—but the often crowded site is absolutely packed at these times.Staying in the Chichén Itzá area allows visitors to visit early in the morning, out of the hot sun and without the company of the many tourists who arrive on day trip tours from Mérida and Cancun. There is also a light show on the site at night.",
"On the edge of a small cornfield near the ruined Maya city of Chichén Itzá, in the sparse shade of a tropical tree, a voice ricochets wildly up the mouth of a well. “¡Lo vi! ¡Lo vi!” the shout proclaims. “I saw it, I saw it!” “¡Sí, es verdad! Yes, it’s true!”Leaning over the mouth of the well, underwater archaeologist Guillermo de Anda needs to make sure that this is what he has been longing to hear for so many months. “What is true, Arturo?” And his fellow archaeologist Arturo Montero, floating down at the bottom of the well, yells up again, “The zenith light! It really works! Get down here!” Then he whoops ecstatically.What de Anda has been waiting anxiously for his friend Montero to determine is whether the water at the bottom of this nondescript natural well, or cenote, had acted as a sacred sundial and timekeeper for the ancient Maya on the two days of the year, May 23 and July 19, when the sun reaches its zenith. At that moment it is vertically overhead, and no shadow is cast. The fact that the cenote is directly northwest of the main staircase of El Castillo, the famous central pyramid of Chichén Itzá, and within that mysterious city’s urban limits, made de Anda’s question particularly intriguing.Centuries earlier, had Maya priests waited in this very well to observe and correct their measurements of the sun’s angle when it reached the zenith, as it does only in the tropics? Did they come here during times of drought to deliver anxious offerings and at other times to give thanks for a plentiful harvest? Did they believe this was a place where the sun and the generous waters met and brought forth life? These and other questions involving the Maya people’s relation to their gods, their sacred city, and their extraordinarily accurate calendar were what the two archaeologists were investigating.De Anda, renowned for his skills as an underwater archaeologist, had been able to work in the Holtún cenote only occasionally and with minimal financing. Montero, from the University of Tepeyac, was at the well on his own money. He had been in the nearby city of Mérida on May 23, leading an archaeoastronomy seminar at the University of Yucatán, where de Anda was teaching. This morning, the day after the zenith, they were at last heading for the Holtún cenote. Their start had been disastrous—a flat tire, a shortage of gasoline, and sundry other hindrances had landed them at the well just as the sun was about to reach its near-zenith position. With minutes to go, Montero and Dante García Sedano, an undergraduate student, had struggled into their diving suits, clipped themselves into harnesses, and been lowered into the well by a crew of local Maya farmers.Now Montero was yelling and whooping, and the farmers were lowering first a rubber raft and then me into the well. De Anda, drenched in sweat in the grilling Yucatán heat, was having a hard time with his rubbery suit. But finally he too was lowered 72 feet into the well, making the four of us in all likelihood the first persons in centuries to watch the path the sun god was tracing across these waters.Beneath the narrow mouth of the cenote, the walls opened up to become a giant dome, cathedral-like except for the roots of trees grasping through the rock for the water. Focused by the small opening—shaped into a rectangle likely to mirror the four-cornered Maya cosmos—the shaft of sunlight danced like fire on the delicate frillery of surrounding stalactites. The edge of the water too seemed to ignite when it was hit by the light, and beneath the normally dark surface the waters turned a transparent turquoise blue. The sun’s rays came so close to vertical that Montero now knew that yesterday, at the zenith moment, a pillar of light would have plunged straight into the water. One didn’t have to be Maya to feel awe.During the past couple of decades archaeologists have begun paying close attention to the role of caves, the zenith sun, and now—through de Anda—cenotes, in the beliefs and world vision of the ancient Maya of Yucatán. Archaeologists had known that the Maya regarded both caves and cenotes as mouths that opened into an otherworld inhabited by Chaak, the god of life-giving rain, but the consequences of this fact for architecture and city planning have only recently started to become clear.In 2010 de Anda, who by then had dived in scores of cenotes, began exploring Holtún at the invitation of Rafael Cobos, a recognized archaeologist and project director who has been busy investigating and mapping the hundreds of ancient structures, promontories, and wells in the Chichén Itzá region. De Anda also had the cooperation of the National Institute of Anthropology and History. Examining the walls of the pool a few yards below the surface, he emerged from a small hollow and felt a protrusion above his head. He was astonished to find that this natural rock shelf held an offering of a human skull, pottery, the skull of a dog, deer bones, and a two-edged knife probably used for sacrifices, all neatly placed there centuries earlier. His headlamp, pointed straight down at the cenote’s depths, revealed broken columns, a carved anthropomorphic jaguar, and a figure similar to one of the little stone men at Chichén Itzá’s Temple of the Warriors, sculpted to look as if they were holding up the sky. This well in the middle of a cornfield was clearly a sacred site.Now, three years later, de Anda and Montero had discovered not only a connection between the zenith sun and Holtún but apparently also the role of that sun and the cenote in the siting and orientation of Chichén Itzá’s El Castillo pyramid. It was already known that at the spring equinox a snake of sunlight slithers down one side of the pyramid’s central staircase—a sight witnessed every year by thousands of tourists. Some walk the short distance to the famous Sacred Cenote, which, over the centuries that Chichén Itzá was a great city-state, received in its mouth any number of human beings and other precious offerings. Early on May 23, the zenith day, Montero had gone to the central pyramid and discovered that the sun, K’inich Ajaw, rises in line with the pyramid’s northeast corner. It then sets in line with the pyramid’s western staircase and the nondescript Holtún well.The Maya, to calibrate their calendar, which is justly famous to this day, had to determine the days of the year when the sun shone exactly overhead, not one fraction of a degree lower or higher. Montero and de Anda speculated that Maya astronomers waited inside the Holtún well for those two zenith moments in the year when a vertical pillar of sunlight pierces the water without reflecting onto the dome.For the Maya, astronomy was a sacred activity, as were architecture and city planning. De Anda and Montero now think that not just Holtún but other cenotes may have played an important role in determining where to site buildings. The Sacred Cenote lies north of El Castillo. Two other cenotes lie to its south and southeast. The Holtún cenote, directly northwest of the pyramid, may have completed the diamond configuration that allowed the Itzá people to determine where to build their sacred city and how to angle its main pyramid. If further studies corroborate all this, the most important coordinates of Chichén Itzá’s overarching design will snap into place.Such at least is de Anda’s hope. But on this day he and Montero had already accomplished much. The sun drew up its spears of light and continued on its way across the face of the Earth, while in the renewed dark the two chattered excitedly about what they had seen and what it meant. “¡Un abrazo, hermano!” Montero exclaimed, and the two men surged toward each other in the water and flappingly embraced.Aboveground the crew of Maya farmers, in shorts and flip-flops, had to work hard to haul the explorers up again. Around us were rustling cornfields that had been waiting for the rain too long, but team master Luis Un Ken, a smiling man respected by everyone in his nearby village, is by nature an optimist. “There was a good rain the other day,” he said, patting the sweat off his face. “The Chaak moved.”For men like Un Ken, the old gods are still very much alive, and Chaak, ruler of cenotes and caves, is among the most important gods of all. For the benefit of living things, he pours from the skies the water he keeps in earthenware jars in caves. Chaak is one and many: Each thunderclap is a separate Chaak in action, breaking a jar open and letting the rain fall. Each god inhabits a separate layer of reality, along with dozens of alternately complacent and ferocious gods that live in the 13 otherworlds above and the 9 otherworlds below. Together, they filled the Maya people’s lives with dreams, visions, and nightmares; a complicated calendar of agricultural times and fertility rituals; and a firm sense of the way things must be done. Chaak had moved, Un Ken said, and that meant the planting season would soon arrive.Chaak’s absence can cause the Yucatán Maya untold disasters, tragedies properly understood only when one is standing on the hard, lunar surface of their former empire, an endless shelf of karstic rock, or limestone. Rain seeps straight through the karst to groundwater levels, and as a result no river or brook runs through the land. (Cenotes are actually sinkholes that extend to the water table.) From the air one sees a green sea of dense jungle. At ground level the tropical forest is thin—spindly trees whose stubborn roots are adapted to the pockets of soil that dot the karst. Wherever the soil hollows are large enough, Maya will plant corn or a milpa, a wise combination of the corn, beans, and squash that constitute their basic source of protein. But corn is a hungry crop; it sucks lots of nutrients from the soil. For thousands of years milpa farmers have kept their small fields productive by burning a different patch of trees every year and planting in the corn-friendly ashes. We call this deforestation, but to the Maya it means survival.As for water for the fields … well, that’s where Chaak comes in. Only seasonal rains can make the corn grow, and they must arrive in an excruciatingly accurate pattern: no rain in winter, so that the fields and forest will be dry enough to burn by March; some rain in early May to soften up the soil for planting; then very gentle rain to allow the planted seeds to sprout and the young corn god to make his appearance in the shape of a barely formed corn ear; finally plenty of rain to send the cornstalks shooting skyward and fatten the kernels on the mature corn. At any point in the yearly cycle irregular rains mean a smaller ration of food for a family.The unsolved archaeological question is why the great Yucatán Maya city-states collapsed one after another. The miracle is that they survived at all, fed by corn grown in such a harsh environment.Yet they did survive—and prospered too—sometimes reaping a plentiful harvest and sometimes, as Guillermo de Anda believes happened at the Holtún well, placing offerings inside a cenote during a prolonged drought, when the water table could sink by 20 feet. With a population estimated in the millions a thousand years ago, the northern Maya built so many cities—in the dry north, always next to a life-giving cenote—that one starts to think the Yucatán forest is an archaeologist’s do-it-yourself: Anyone can trip over an untouched ruin. In fact a couple of days after the Yucatán zenith day, I was trudging down a path between milpas and forest a few miles from Chichén Itzá with archaeologist and cave explorer Donald Slater, when he nodded toward our right and said, “There it is.” There what was? I looked around and saw cornfields to our left and forest to our right. “There,” Slater insisted. Just skinny trees, and behind those, more trees. Then what looked like a blurry thickening of the forest about 50 yards off the path turned out to be a steeply pitched hill. Of course there are no steep hills anywhere in the neighborhood. But there are pyramids. This was a particularly tall one, and directly facing its southwest corner was a very big cave.To the Maya the cave would have been a mouth, the gaping jaws of a devouring Earth deity or one of the dwelling places of Chaak. Slater was hoping to document his claim that this cave was a sacred observation point from which to greet the arrival of the sun on its zenith day and that this pyramid—which has been known about but never fully explored—was built or at least oriented specifically in relation to the cave.Before our visit Slater had asked a crew of Maya farmers to clear the jungle growth covering the structure’s western face so that the zenith sun’s track could be observed more clearly. At the cave’s lip Slater pointed out the remains of a set of stairs rough-hewed centuries before, perhaps to give shamans access to this terrifying maw of the Earth. Slater speculates that the solar priests would have spent the night before the zenith sun fasting, dancing, and chanting to the sound of drums and double-chambered clay flutes like those he found deep inside the cave, praising the sun god for bringing the zenith day around once more, and with it, the rains.As we stood where the holy men once might have, the entire pyramid loomed before us. We waited. At 8:07 a.m. a fat, orange globe bobbled up behind the pyramid, appeared to pause for a second or two, and then displayed itself in blinding glory as it cleared the top, filling our cave with its fiery light. Centuries ago on the two zenith days, Slater explained, it would have performed its bobble dance on what are now the ruins of a platform on the top southwest corner of the structure.To the sky-gazing Maya, the pyramids in the Yucatán, others of which were aligned with the rising and setting suns of equinox and zenith days, would have seemed not landbound piles of stone but cosmic timekeepers—upward-yearning structures in constant interaction with the heavens. And the interaction of K’inich Ajaw, the sun, and the sacred waters of Chaak was the dance of life that made the cornfields possible.I was on my own modest search for Chaak. Roaming the Yucatán Peninsula, I was looking for rituals and beliefs held by modern Maya that might help me understand their link to their glorious ancestors. Most Maya today live in poor farming communities, and Chaak, who remains so important to them, is celebrated seasonally in an extended rain-calling prayer known as a Cha Chaak.Some 80 miles southeast of Chichén Itzá, approaching the area now known by the misleading, if glamorous, name of the Maya Riviera, lies the village of Chunpón. It is part of a government-designated Zona Maya that covers a sizable portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. I visited Chunpón in the company of a man named Pastor Caamal. During work hours he is a proudly independent tour guide, and like many of his neighbors and Luis Un Ken, he is a Cruzoob, or believer in the Talking Cross, a relic from the 19th-century uprising known as the Caste War. A descendant of Maya warriors who fought government troops, he still does round-the-clock guard duty at the cross’s sacred garrison two weeks out of every year.“The Cruzoob are basically the Maya who survived,” Caamal said to me on a summer afternoon as we zipped down a flat highway in the Zona Maya toward his hometown. That was something of an exaggeration: The Caste War was a strictly local affair, and there are approximately five million Maya living in an area that encompasses the lower third of Mexico, as well as most of Belize and Guatemala, western Honduras, and western El Salvador. But it is true that in the Yucatán, the war touched nearly every village.I asked Caamal how he bridged the difference between the old Maya gods and Jesus Christ, whom the Maya frequently invoke, sometimes calling him Our Lord Most Holy Cross Three Persons. “We are polytheists,” Caamal answered. Strikingly, there is virtually no Catholic presence in the zona; instead there are hmem—shamans, healers, and enchanters who usually discover their vocation in dreams, then mediate between the gods and their needy worshippers.In answer to my increasingly desperate queries about where I might be able to witness a Cha Chaak rain ritual, Caamal said his own hmem might know of a Cha Chaak coming up somewhere, although it was late in the season.In the bruising heat of midday we made a brief stop in Chunpón at Caamal’s family compound. In the oval kitchen hut was strung a row of hammocks, each cradling a Caamal relative who lay chatting and rocking gently. It would have been cooler without the hearth—three large stones on the dirt floor with embers glowing beneath a large iron griddle—but the kitchen embers are always stoked. Caamal’s fierce, tiny mother glared at me, a “Spanish,” or non-Maya, visitor, but she made some tortillas, offering them with meat and chilies. Later she would pointedly ask her son when I was planning to get out of her hammock and leave, but the rules of hospitality, as set as the movement of the stars, dictated that food be offered.Back on the road, we saw slender trees shooting up from the bone-white, bone-hard surface of the karst. We stopped at the village of Chun-Yah, which, like many in the Zona Maya, has no land or cellular phone communication with the outside world and only rudimentary schools. In his own dusty compound of oval thatched-roof huts, Caamal’s mentor and hmem, Mariano Pacheco Caamal, greeted me with a broad smile.Don Mariano said he knew how to use 40 different kinds of plants to cure illnesses and heal fractures and snakebites. At a particularly fragile time for Pastor, Don Mariano had built a protective ring of invisible fire around his friend. In dreams he had learned what to ask each god and on which day of the week. He knew where to find the sacred caves.Don Mariano wore cutoffs and flip-flops and seemed to have remarkably few possessions for a man of his age and prestige. He spoke only elementary Spanish, and because my Mayan is nonexistent, Pastor had to translate my questions a few different ways to get the meaning across. I asked Don Mariano how he knew he was Maya. The mild-mannered hmem blinked behind his thick glasses. “Because we are poor,” he said. I asked again. “Because of what we eat, our skin color, our height,” came the reply, and then he thought of a better answer. “Because here there are no factories, machines, smoke. At night we have peacefulness, silence. In the morning I say, Today I will do this or that. Our work is our own. When one works for outsiders, they say, Give me your time. But Maya are their own rulers.”Did he know of a Cha Chaak coming up? Alas, Don Mariano could only confirm that I was late. In Chun-Yah as elsewhere, the time for planting and rain invoking had already passed. Then he graciously explained how a Cha Chaak offering is set up in his small part of the Maya universe. A rectangular altar, or offering table, about three feet wide and made of saplings and a few boards, represents the world. The various foods for Chaak are placed on it in a strict order, along with half-gourd cups of a sacred fermented drink, balché, made from tree bark, and gourds filled with holy water taken from a hidden cenote or cave. The special food offering consists of 13 loaves of “bread,” thick tortillas made of 13 layers of masa, or corn dough, representing the 13 layers of the otherworld above. The bread is wrapped in leaves ofbakaalché, a local vine, and baked in a coffin-size pit, or pib, dug out near the altar. A cross is placed at the center back of the table to oversee the whole.I ventured that I had heard about sapitos, small boys who crouch at the base of the altar table and encourage Chaak to arrive by imitating the call of frogs during the rainy season. Pastor and the hmem looked at each other and smiled.“You heard about that [near Chichén Itzá], right?” Pastor said. He imitated the boys imitating the frogs: “They go lek lek lek.” He smiled again. “Muy bonita costumbre. A very pretty custom.” He grinned. “We don’t do that here.”The ceremony in Yaxuná had almost ended by the time I caught up with it. For going on two days rain-desperate villagers and their hmem had toiled without rest or sleep to persuade Chaak to come to them. They had walked a long way through the forest to a secret cave and scrabbled down to its center on a scary rope system to bring up the water the ceremony required. They had raised the altar, dug the pib, gone to enormous expense to provide 13 fat hens for the ritual meal, guarded the altar overnight while praying and drinking balché, patted out the stacks of 13-layer corn-and-squash-seed breads that no women had been allowed to touch, cooked them in the pib, and brought them out of their fiery bed again, leaving the pit open so that the steam could rise directly to the rain god as an offering.And now the hmem, Hipólito Puuc Tamay, a slow-moving, leathery man in a red baseball cap and much washed shirt, was standing in front of the altar praying to Chaak, to Jesus Christ, to all the saints, to San Juan Bautista, to the forces of the Earth and sky, and to Chaak again, to let the holy blessing of rain fall on them and on all the surrounding Maya communities so that they might survive one more full cycle of the sun. On instructions from the hmem, one of the villagers crouched on a rock behind and to one side of the altar, keeping very still, only blowing from time to time into one of the gourds in which Chaak stores the wind. He was just one of the neighbors, but he was also the rain god, and he sat with his eyes closed so as not to harm the ceremony with his terrible glance. Two other participants brought him to the altar, facing backward, to receive the hmem’s neutralizing blessing.And there the little frogs were too, five slightly abashed boys crouching at the foot of the world altar, one boy at each corner and one at the center, four of them saying,hmaa, hmaa, hmaa, and the fifth, lek lek lek lek lek, a blended sound remarkably like that of frogs in the evening rain.Out of nowhere a wind came up in the clearing. Thunder rolled in the blue distance.As the ceremonial meal of chicken and the corn-and-seed bread was being distributed to the exhausted men, the rain started—a light, refreshing summer shower. A sign, the hmem said, that Chaak had received his offering and was pleased with his people’s prayer. Soon, perhaps, the Earth would be ready for planting.",
"It has been said that reading books is surreal: You stare at marked slices of tree for hours on end, hallucinating vividly. Book lovers, therefore, are a strange bunch. They spend hours by themselves, escaping this world and immersing themselves in another. The variety of their worlds is as limitless as human knowledge. It’s a wonder that any one thing would bring these solitary souls together—until you consider the library. (See 14 other epic libraries around the world.)Perhaps no institution in society holds as much promise as libraries do. For ancient monks, libraries were the repository of sacred knowledge; for early scientists, they made possible technical advancements and medical cures. The advent of the modern public library represents the greatest aspiration for civil society, namely that people would want to read, educate themselves, and actively broaden their horizons.Of course, civil society is often under threat and therefore so are libraries. As repositories of theology and culture, libraries throughout history have come under fire—sometimes literally. Wars and fires have ravaged libraries, most notably the Library of Alexandria, but also lesser-known ones like Prague’s Strahov monastery library, which was destroyed by fire only to then suffer centuries of invading armies.Threats to libraries aren’t always so extreme, though. The everyday problem of protecting antiquities from the ravages of time, or even merely from pests (both human and animal) is a principal concern. The Biblioteca Girolamini in Naples suffered at the hands of a crime ring that systematically plundered the collection in 2012, though librarians and bibliophiles the world over remarkably managed to recover the vast majority of stolen books.Tasked with protecting our cultural heritage, librarians are unsung heroes, the first line of defense. But in Portugal, librarians find themselves with an unusual ally: bats. Book-loving insects are ingeniously kept at bay by bat colonies in such places as Coimbra’s Biblioteca Joanina and Mafra’s Biblioteca Municipal. (Explore the ancient temple full of meat-eating bats.)Aside from books’ inherent value, libraries themselves often inspire awe and wonder. This is perhaps best illustrated when it comes to architecture. Some of history’s greatest architects have been commissioned to build libraries, from the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Henri Labrouste’s precursor to the modern library, to the Seattle Public Library, a contemporary marvel designed by Rem Koolhaas.In these photos, we take a closer look at some of the most remarkable and beautiful libraries in the world. These marvels—like St. Emmeram, renowned in the Early Middle Ages for its bookmaking, or the private collections of former nobles now available to the public—might just inspire you to explore new worlds of your own.",
"Ninth-century illuminated manuscripts and the earliest known architectural plan drawn on parchment are just some of the literary treasures at the resplendent 1,200-year-old Baroque-style Convent of St Gall in Switzerland.A cab driver once told me that, at the age of eight, he walked 10 miles from his Egyptian hometown in search of a private library rumored to have a copy of Nizar Qabbani’s Arabian Love Poems. Disregarding Washington D.C.'s late-night club-goers jaywalking outside the taxi, he drove me home swooning, reciting verses from another book he’d discovered on that journey—Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet.A good library is always worth the trip for what we might find there, whether it is 10 miles away or 10 countries away, whether the books are two inches high or two stories high, whether they arrive via donkey, camel, boat, or bike. And while any library can lead us to a new literary discovery, the following 14 epic libraries around the globe take typical book appreciation to a whole new level.Caitlin Etherton is a poet and farmer currently based in Richmond, Virginia.",

"There’s a famous 1940s study—the Clark and Clark “doll tests”—that demonstrated that African-American children aligned positive values with white dolls, opting for those over dolls that shared their own skin color.“The toys that children play with help shape their versions of reality,” says global curriculum designer Gahmya Drummond-Bey. “Through toys, children often decide what is deemed ‘normal’ or even beautiful.”That study focused on toys, but the reality is that almost everything kids are exposed to will shape their views on what the world should look like. That includes books.“Literature is a huge part of how young people get introduced to stories and narratives and representation of other people and themselves,” says Nicole Johnson, executive director of We Need Diverse Books. “To combat discrimination head on, children must be exposed to diverse literature to help reveal the influence of race, to teach understanding, and also to help build empathy.”Rudine Sims Bishop, professor emerita of education at The Ohio State University, who’s also been called the “mother of multicultural literature,” introduced the concept of children’s literature as either a window that provided readers a glipse of a world outside their homes, or a mirror that reflected the reader through the lives of relatable characters.Johnson says kids need both. But when it comes to children’s books by and about people of color, the numbers suggest readers rarely get it.According to information compiled in 2018 by the Cooperative Children’s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 50 percent of children’s books depict white characters. But only 10 percent depict Black characters. (Books with First Nations, Latino, and Asian-Pacific-American protagonists are even fewer.) That means kids of color have many “windows” into a white world, but white children are reading books that are mostly mirrors, without diverse characters or ideas.Parents who build a diverse home library can change that.“The world is diverse. There isn’t a single experience, so our bookshelves shouldn’t have a single experience represented in them,” Johnson says. “You want to give young people a space to see what is possible and to really connect with folks outside themselves.”Erin Pahlke, associate professor of psychology at Whitman College, agrees, noting that kids as young as six months old can differentiate between faces from different racial groups. “It’s just not true to say kids don’t see color or that they don’t notice race,” she says. “Kids are looking at what’s going on around them and trying to make sense of the world.”Parents can foster that inquisitiveness with their home library, she says. “Having a diverse media landscape in your house gives kids examples of lots of different, positive people who are from different racial and ethnic groups,” Pahlke says. “It also gives families an opening to have important conversations.”Here’s how to build a diverse home library for your children.Sit with your kids, pull all the books off their shelves, and talk about what you see … and what you don’t.“Infant and toddler board books tend to focus on shapes, animals, or inanimate objects,” Johnson says. “That’s lovely, but when you're teaching about human connection and empathy, you need actual human beings in the book.”If all your books include dogs or all the protagonists are male, point that out to your kids. “Step back and look at everything,” Johnson says. “If I was a young child trying to figure out the world based on what I see here, what would I think?”If your collection lacks racial diversity, intentionally and vocally set out to fix that. Start by adding books that have pictures and relatable characters of other races.“Part of it is normalizing the idea that lots of different people and groups are out there interacting with one another,” Pahlke says. But don’t feel like you need to constantly point out race as you read. The key, she says, is having children understand diversity as something that’s normal, good, and positive.Not all the books need to be anti-racist biographies, or about slavery or civil rights. Make sure your collection has titles that simply show people of color in typical situations.“Any kindergartner can relate to a story about the first day of school,” Johnson says. “Put those books on the shelf alongside titles that are more historical, or about identity and culture, current events, and social justice.”Don’t just buy the books and put them on the shelf, Pahlke says. Instead, use them as an opportunity to reinforce family values. Johnson suggests asking questions like:—What's going on in this picture? —What do you notice about the characters? —How are they feeling? —How is it making you feel? —How do you know what's happening in the story? —How do you know they're feeling that way? —How are the characters like you or people you know? How are they different?The two latter questions give a child the chance to shift perspective. “The first gives the child an opportunity to reflect on the thoughts and feelings of those in their community, who they may not regularly engage with,” Drummond-Bey says. “The second question compels them to see themselves in those who may seem nothing like them.”As a parent, you’re listening for how your child understands race and gently correcting value judgments. And it won’t always be comfortable, Johnson warns.“We're trying to figure out a different way of being, and that that's not easy,” she says. “It takes intentionality and it takes knowing—as the adult who's modeling for your kids—what you hope they'll value.”These sites will help you get started selecting titles for a more diverse home library collection.We Need Diverse Books’ “Our Story” app highlights books with diverse content and by content creators from marginalized communities.

"Children who read often have bigger vocabularies and stronger comprehension skills. And a Pew Research survey reported that reading is considered the second most important skill kids need to get ahead. So start a new chapter in your child’s life by raising a reader with these tips.Studies show that reading to babies (even before they’re born!) can boost vocabulary and give them a head start to reading. Luckily infants aren’t too discerning and will listen to you read pretty much anything—newspapers, romance novels, the back of the cereal box. Beginning readers, however, need engagement through adorable photos, compelling stories, and rhyming text. Get started with a sneak peek at the new early-reader book Somebunny Loves Me.When children follow along while a book is read aloud, they’re reinforcing spelling skills and improving comprehension. The same can be said for following along with subtitles on a video. Try this trick by turning on the closed captioning on some silly animal music videos.

"PHOTOGRAPH BY GETTY IMAGESRight about now your family has binged every TV show, taken 10,000 walks, mastered chalk art, and quite possibly run out of things to talk about. Here’s something that can spark some new conversations: a family book club.Reading together as a family nurtures all the usual literacy skills: comprehension, reasoning, language skills, etc. But a family book club can also foster self-expression, creative thinking, and empathy in kids. Plus, a recent study suggests that children from book-oriented homes develop higher reading, math, and technological skills that can benefit them later in life. “Home reading helps improve concentration, imagination, and confidence,” says Patricia Edwards, professor of language and literacy at Michigan State University. “And it relaxes the body and calms the mind.” (Get tips on raising a reader.)Step one is to choose the book. Have each family member suggest four titles—from picture books, novels, even graphic novels—then vote as a group to select one per list. To ease kids into the club, start with favorite books that kids have already read; once they’re hooked, start selecting books new to everyone. And don’t underestimate those books for beginning readers. Though subtle, many picture books have character development, tension, and plot twists. Even nonreaders can join the family book club. “Choose a wordless picture book, or let them retell a story based on the illustrations,” Edwards says. (Get book ideas from Nat Geo Kids and Nat Geo Travel.)After the book is chosen, let children set the pace, choosing to read to each other as a family, in pairs, or alone. Let them decide when to meet, but schedule it once or twice a month at the most. Plan for an hour or less, even with older children.Before you meet, choose a leader to run the discussion, and make sure older children have a turn. The leader can then decide on an informal outline to keep the conversations moving. For example, the outline might include two questions to encourage discussion; a theme focusing on a character, storytelling style, or the ending; and a quick vote on whether the book deserves a second read. (Just be sure to throw the outline out the window anytime everyone gets immersed in the conversation.)Children new to a book club might be shy or unsure about expressing thoughts; they might even confuse it with doing a book report. To make them more comfortable, encourage thoughts and analysis appropriate for their age and skills instead of pushing or demanding deeper answers. Help them by asking open-ended questions that start with why, what if, and how. For example, you might ask, “Why didn’t the character listen?” or “What if the dog didn’t follow the girl?” Kids will surprise you with their in-depth thoughts.Older children can explore the nuances of characters, like their virtues and flaws, how they change, or what they learn throughout the story. Parents can help encourage this thinking by providing fuller answers and descriptions. For example, you might say things such as, “I like this character because …” or “I’m curious to find out how / why / what happens if ….” You can also build confidence with phrases like “Excellent point,” or “I hadn’t thought of that.”Don’t worry if the conversations spark some disagreement—that’s OK. Debate in book club is vital, and allowing children to express different opinions builds confidence and teaches how to thoughtfully argue. The key is to make sure the conversation stays respectful. Use neutral phrases such as, “I see what you’re saying, but I think …,” “I’m not sure I agree,” “I’ll have to think about that,” and the ever popular “Let’s agree to disagree.”Here are some ideas to get the pages turning at your family book club meeting.—Have a bowl with open-ended questions written on slips of paper, and take turns choosing them. (Make sure kids understand that these are not test-like questions to see what everyone remembers.)— Ask: If you were the writer, what would you change about the story?— Finish this sentence: I think (character’s name) is misunderstood because …— Have one person read a picture book aloud without sharing the illustrations. Then reread it showing the illustrations. Discuss how the art changes everyone’s understanding of the story.— Examine how people, cultures, and experiences shared in book compare to your family’s.— Discuss how a story would be different if it were set in a different era or location.— Challenge each other to rewrite the ending.— Consider how removing a character would change a story.— For an illustrated book, ask readers how the art brings the book to life. Would they have drawn something different?— Take turns reading scenes using different voices.— Act out a favorite scene from the book.— Choose which character each person relates to most.— Pick a character and describe how you’d spend the day together.— Finish this thought: If I were (character in this moment) I would have ... because ....— Ask: How does this book / scene / character make you feel?— Read a couple chapters of a novel, then write down how you think the book will end. See who comes the closest.— Prepare a meal that a character ate in the book.— Figure out what song or style of music would make great background music to the story.",
"Marisa Johnson’s six-year-old daughter was just learning to read independently when her Alameda, California, school shut down last year. Without solid literacy skills and lots of time stuck at home, the tot is spending much more time playing video games and watching shows than reading books.“She’s definitely reading less,” Johnson says. “The only way we can be alone among ourselves is with screens.”As many parents know, screen time has ballooned during the pandemic. Recreational device time jumped 67 percent among kids ages four to 17 during lockdown in Germany, according to a study published in Nature. Dubit Limited found an 11 percent increase in screen time among U.S. kids ages two to 15; laptop usage jumped 52 percent, likely due to distance learning.Although no studies have yet shown that the bump in screen time has resulted in less recreational reading time, it’s possible, says Christine Elgersma, senior editor of learning resources at Common Sense Media. And the combination of learning loss from disrupted schooling and less time spent reading could have consequences.Research has consistently tied reading activity and proficiency to academic success, increased empathy, and a deeper understanding of the world—all things most parents want for their kids. But if screens have taken over your kids’ lives, parents can still steer kids back toward books, says Maria Russo, former children’s book editor at the New York Times and co-author of How to Raise a Reader.“If you want your kids to become readers you have to help them find books they love,” she says. “That means that your work is not so much nagging them to read or taking away their devices—your work is helping them discover the kinds of books that excite them.”Russo admits that it might take a little more work than before, but the methods parents can use to encourage reading in kids hasn’t changed because of the pandemic. Here are some tips to try:Tap into their interests. Match books to kids’ obsessions—whether it’s animals, history, or Minecraft—and kids are hooked. “Those are kids who cannot wait to read,” Russo says. “They crave those books.”Consider your kid’s personality when helping them find books. “Some kids are information seekers,” Russo says. “They’re not necessarily reading for the story but to answer their questions.” She suggests atlases or almanacs, like Guinness World Records.Limit devices and make books accessible. Digital temptations can be hard even for adults to resist, Elgersma says. Making some rules can help. “Setting up some screen-free times and zones in your house encourages kids to find something else to do,” she says. Examples might be before bedtime or on a weekend afternoon.And then make reading easy: “Have some books you think might appeal to them lying around to tempt kids who are looking for something to do,” she says.Fill in gaps. For kids who live in homogenous communities, reading books by authors who can offer a realistic glimpse into a different world—whether racial, regional, or socio-economic—can help kids develop empathy and understanding. “This is the world they’re inheriting,” Russo says.Create readerly habits. Browse in bookstores or make regular trips to the library to help build a habit of seeking out new books, Russo says. And then when they grow up, they’ll pop into bookstores, too. “They find themselves unconsciously emulating how their parents live,” she adds.Reading for pleasure in front of your kids helps, too, says Theresa Yang, a school librarian and mother of four who recently held a remote literacy night at her kids’ former school on behalf of her company Graphic Campus. “We did a survey asking kids how many of their parents read for pleasure. They all had an answer,” she says. “Kids are very observant of their parents reading habits.” She says she noticed a correlation between the kids who said their parents read and the students who are strong readers.Explore genres. Graphic novels, poetry, and novels in verse can be easier ways for kids to jump into books if they’re having trouble getting motivated. “You’re not confronted with a wall of text,” says Gene Yang, Theresa’s husband and author of several graphic novels, including the Printz award-winning American-Born Chinese.Don’t shy away from tough stuff. As kids get older, some parents might worry that the topics in young adult books are too mature. But Russo says if kids are interested, it’s not likely to do them any harm. “Wouldn’t you rather have your kid learn about this stuff through a book instead of the internet?” she asks.Plus, tough topics can help contextualize what’s happening in their worlds. “You might not think they’re ready to read about drug addiction or police brutality,” Russo says. “But if that’s what their friends are talking about, they want to be in the conversation.”Encourage fandoms. Diving deep into fan communities by creating and publishing fan art or dressing up like favorite characters can help keep kids excited about books, says Gene Yang, who’s currently writing a Batman / Superman graphic novel for DC Comics. Writing fan fiction in online platforms can be a fun way to mix reading and writing. “I think that fan fiction and cosplay gives people in general—and kids in particular—a way of participating in what they’re reading,” he says.Create community and connection. Reading doesn’t have to be a solitary experience, Elgersma says. “Reading a book together—out loud or book-club-style—can add a social, connective element,” she says. And that’s something parents can do along with kids or they can help organize virtual sessions with friends. (Here’s how to start a family book club.)In breakout rooms at the Yangs’ recent literacy night, teachers led kids in a book scavenger hunt. They asked them to find different books—a favorite book, a specific genre, a book with a certain color cover—and show them on screen. “That activity built a sense of community, even virtually,” Gene says.Read family stories. Gene Yang recently showed his kids an essay a young cousin had written for school about Yang’s grandparents. “They were so enthralled,” he says, adding that they especially loved reading about their family history through the perspective of another family member. He suggests that parents ask grandparents or siblings for writing stashed in attics or garages. “Every family has a body of literature,” Yang says.Give in to digital—a little. Research is mixed on the benefits of paper books versus e-books, but Elgersma says if e-books (or even audio books) are what get your kid excited to read, fine. Just steer away from reading apps with lots of interactive features, which have been shown to reduce retention of information, she says.Don’t worry. For those parents whose children were once readers but now spend their free time plugged into an Xbox, don’t fret, Russo says. As they get closer to adolescence, kids might just be taking a break and trying to define their own identities. “The fact is that books and the written word are a really great way to tell stories and deliver information,” she says. “And when people are looking for that, they’ll gravitate back to books.”And if reading just isn’t happening right now, don’t be so hard on them (or yourself). “I’ve had a much harder time concentrating on reading in the pandemic,” Gene Yang says. “So I do think people have to have grace for themselves—and for their kids.”",
"Award-winning teen poet Mckalah Jimenez has been writing poetry since she was nine years old, but it became a lifeline in recent years.When she felt overwhelmed with anxiety, poetry was a release—a way for her to express her emotions and regain a sense of control. “I was writing more and more, and I came up with poems every single day,” says Jimenez, who was a junior in high school during the pandemic. “Poetry helped me take my mind off being kept away from the outside world.”Like Jimenez, many kids are grappling with stress. Poetry is a creative outlet that can help them express themselves during times of stress.In fact, the positive effects of poetry garnered national attention during President Joe Biden’s inauguration as the world watched 2017 National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman’s moving reading of “The Hill We Climb,” a lyrical message of hope and heartache inspired by the events of the past year. In an interview with NPR, Gorman revealed how writing poetry helped her overcome a speech impediment and gave her creative freedom.“Writing, particularly journaling and poetry, provides people with emotional release,” says Nicholas Mazza, professor and dean emeritus of the Florida State University College of Social Work and founder of the journal Poetry Therapy. “If you’re anxious or worried about something, writing it down helps you get some control over it.”Poetry can improve kids’ well-being, reading comprehension, and self-esteem—and they don’t need to be award-winning youth laureates to reap these benefits. Here’s why poetry is so powerful, and how parents can help foster creativity at home.Poetry has some unique linguistic characteristics that set it apart from other types of writing. Compared to traditional prose, poetry often communicates ideas and emotions through metaphor, condenses ideas into fewer words, and uses rhythm and rhyme to give it a musical quality.fMRI studies show that listening to poetry activates similar brain regions as listening to music—likely because poetry taps into the melodic properties of language. This includes the brain’s reward system, which is responsible for pleasurable emotions. And because of the emotional nature of poetic language, researchers suggest it may also foster empathy in the reader or listener.These rhythmic qualities can also sharpen kids’ reading skills and memory, says neuroscientist Katherine Swett Aboud, a researcher in the Education and Brain Science Research Lab at Vanderbilt University. That’s because rhymes and rhythms are particularly memorable, and they help younger children learn phonology, or the sounds of words.And unlike prose, poetry is more likely to activate areas of the brain associated with introspection, which is key in cultivating mindfulness. “We know that when you teach kids mindfulness meditation, they’re able to experience the same reduction in stress that adults do, even young children,” says Anandhi Narasimhan, a psychiatrist based in Los Angeles. “The only difference is that kids’ brains are still developing, so there could be an added benefit over time.”Finally, creating poetry is a multi-stage creative process. Whether you’re a novice or a pro, the act of writing poetry—and then revising it—can exercise different areas of the brain related to focus and creativity, says Swett Aboud, who co-authored a neuroimaging study of poetry composition and revision.Research shows that isolation and increased anxiety related to the pandemic can worsen mental health problems in young people, including substance misuse. While not a substitute for professional mental health treatment, creative writing—whether it’s journaling, poetry, or storytelling—can help kids express and work through these complex emotions.“This pandemic has brought about feelings of isolation and stress to so many people, including children,” Narasimhan says. “Part of cognitive-behavioral therapy involves putting your thoughts on paper so you can dissect what you were thinking. Many of my patients have found comfort in writing poetry and songwriting because it allows them to do just that.”Poetry is a form of writing that often evokes emotion in both the writer and reader. That’s what makes it a particularly strong medium for kids and teens to explore feelings and individuality, Narasimhan says.“The last year has had an incredible impact on my work,” says 17-year-old Alora Young, the 2020 Nashville Youth Poet Laureate. “The Black Lives Matter movement and protest served as an inspiration for art I have been waiting to make but never had the words to.”Nineteen-year-old Faye Harrison, the 2020-21 Ann Arbor / Ypsilanti Youth Poet Laureate, was also inspired by recent events in the United States. “Poetry is kind of like reconstructing language to tell your story,” Harrison says. “My poetry is political because as a Black queer person, my existence ends up being political. For some reason, my existence and identity is always up for debate.” But through poetry, Harrison controls the narrative.It’s also an outlet for kids to express things they may not be ready to talk about. “When someone writes or shares poetry, it’s liberating for them because they’re able to express secrecy or things they can’t express otherwise,” Narasimhan says. “Having someone read it and accept it and still show them compassion is empowering. Sharing vulnerabilities is empowering in that it reduces shame and feelings of loneliness and abandonment.”Poetry can also allow kids to feel safe when writing about personal struggles, explains Kirsten Giles, workshop coordinator for WriteGirl, a nonprofit mentorship program for teen girls in Los Angeles. For example, they may write about encountering a bear in the forest as a metaphor for a difficult encounter.“The shield of creativity and abstraction protects your vulnerability,” Giles says. “It puts you back in control.”Kids often feel like they have no choices—and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has amplified these feelings. But Mazza says that poetry gives them a myriad of choices—not just in form, composition, and punctuation, but in the words and topics they choose.“You can’t make a mistake expressing personal feelings,” Mazza says.Harrison says encouraging children to read the works of diverse poets is a good starting point to help kids tune into what excites them about poetry. Here are five other ideas to get your kids started:Sit outside. Giles recommends having kids spend five minutes outside exploring each of their five senses—this can inspire poetry while also relieving stress. You can also take a walk to observe your surroundings, and take photos for even more creative energy.Look within. Giles uses common prompts to explore identity, such as “I come from,” “I believe,” and “This is the story of my name.” “It’s almost like when we put our identity on a page, we own it more,” she says.Make a list. Lists are another way to ease into writing, Giles says. Encouraging kids to make lists of their favorite foods, for example, or animals they’d love to be able to talk to can spark imagination.Rip and scribble. Another way to get kids inspired is not writing at all. Instead, try ripping out a page from a magazine and start crossing out words. “Leave words that you like, and poetry can just happen,” Giles says. Another option is to create a rule, like writing down every third noun in the dictionary and playing around with the results.Follow a prompt. Fill-in-the-blank poetry prompts are a less intimidating way to start writing thoughts and seeing where they lead, says Alex Leviton, a volunteer with the Pongo Poetry Project, a Seattle-based teen poetry organization. For example:• Today, my heart feels like ...• If my heart could speak, it would say …• A good day is when you are given …• I hope every empty room will eventually have …• I want you to understand my pain when ….Most importantly, support your child in their self-expression. “People ‘nope’ each other all the time; kids are used to this,” Leviton says. “They hear, ‘No, you don't feel that way,’ or ‘That's not important.’ I tell parents all the time, don’t ‘nope’ them.”",
"“Dear coronavirus: You stink. Because of you, I’m stuck at home, miss my friends, can’t play sports, and am trapped with my parents and my little brother, who is always farting.”It seems like the pandemic will never end, and kids are likely boiling over with frustrations, questions, concerns, ideas, and stories they want to share. Journaling is a perfect outlet to express everything on their mind. “If kids can put events and observations on paper, it helps makes sense of this bewildering and frightening time,” says Melissa Hart, author of Better with Books: 500 Diverse Books to Ignite Empathy and Encourage Self-Acceptance in Tweens and Teens. “A child’s emotions seem less scary when they see them on paper.”Even during “normal” times, journaling helps kids become more confident in their ability to express themselves and promotes writing, language, communication, and art skills. But forget the old-fashioned idea of a diary that recaps an ordinary, sometimes mundane, daily routine. “A journal lets your child articulate ideas, art, stories, and feelings,” Hart says. It can also be a collection of things the writer wants to remember, a funny conversation they overheard, something they’re curious about, or an idea for an invention.“Journaling provides a place for an active mind to store ideas and an outlet for pent up intellectual energy and emotions,” says Peter Gwin, National Geographic editor at large. “I think of it as a mad scientist’s laboratory, a place with complete freedom to explore and say whatever the writer wants. It's really that sense of freedom that’s important.”It certainly doesn’t take much to get started. “Kids simply need paper and something to write with,” Gwin says. In fact, the perfect journal is whatever fits your child’s style: a spiral notepad, mixed media paper, sketchpad, bound notebooks with lines, graph paper, or blank pages. “Add a great pen, plus color pencils, paint, glue sticks, and scissors, and your child’s imagination can go in any direction,” Hart says. Your child might prefer to keep their journal on the computer or make photo or video journals.Some kids might need more than one. “I keep a few pocket-size journals going at any one time,” Gwin says. “I have one by my bed for those flashes that come right before sleep or that wake me up in the middle of the night. Others are filled with newspaper clippings, pressed flowers, lists, crazy ideas, and rants about my favorite sports team.”Let children be in control of their journaling journey. Allow them to find the right time and location to write: Even just a few minutes a day a couple times a week keeps things fresh and fun, plus reduces pressure to be creative on demand. Make sure they’re writing for themselves. “Your child doesn’t have to write specifically about emotions or feelings,” Hart says. “Often those feelings will end up on the page in an organic way.”And remind your child not to worry about spelling, punctuation, or grammar. “It’s a structure- and rule-free zone,” Hart says.Perhaps the biggest question on parents’ minds: Should you read your child’s journal? Both Hart and Gwin agree that privacy matters.“Parents will approach this differently, but my feeling is that for a kid to feel truly free and empowered to explore, they need a nonjudgment zone, beyond the prying eyes of parents,” Gwin says. “Though my kids often want to share what they've written.”As any writer will tell you, the blank page can sometimes be intimidating. If your child is stuck or can’t think of anything to get started, give them a challenge or a prompt. Below are some ideas to kickstart your child’s journaling.—Make lists, such as a child’s top five ice cream flavors, books, songs, jokes, or words—Write a backstory for a minor character in a favorite movie, book, or TV show, like Ollivander the wandmaker in the Harry Potter book—Write a one-paragraph story about a photo of a vacation, relative, or funny moment.—Sketch or doodle.—Write a letter to the coronavirus or another issue your child might be stressing about.—Describe how the house has changed now that parents and kids are home all the time.—Finish this sentence: This is why I’m angry / sad / scared.—Describe the unexpected benefits of sheltering in place.—Write a story about a superhero and the coronavirus (or another topic that’s causing stress).—Tell a story about everyone being at home all the time—but from the perspective of your family’s pet.—Write five wishes.—Compare a typical day now to a typical day from a year ago.",
"In a key scene in the movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, the main character, after swinging between the city’s skyscrapers, stands on a building, removes his mask, and reveals … that he’s Black.Watching, my 14-year-old son—who’s also Black—squealed with joy. It was one of the few times he’d seen a positive Black image modeled back to him from a screen, and clearly, it felt good.He’s not imagining the absence. While modern children’s television shows are far more diverse than the shows their parents’ watched as kids, streaming apps expose children to older shows that often don’t represent reality when it comes to diversity and inclusiveness. According to 2019’ Hollywood Diversity Report, 80 percent of lead actors in movies are white, as are 78 percent in scripted TV shows; if diverse actors and themes are included, they’re overwhelmingly stereotypical.That lack of accurate on-screen diversity can create subconscious ideas in all of us—including children—about people of color, according to clinical psychologist Allison Briscoe-Smith.“Implicit bias is basically the unconscious associations we make when we see repeated messages about who’s on the upside of power and who’s on the downside of power,” she explains. “Our brain works really fast to fill in information for us. And those blanks, sometimes, are biased.”It’s an issue that’s been amplified during the pandemic, thanks to  screen times that have doubled from a year earlier. So when kids watch a group of friends who are all white, a science club that has only one girl, or villains who are consistently people of color, they begin to see that as a normal reality, says Polly Conway, senior TV editor at Common Sense Media.“You don't really notice it,” she says. “But it's there and it gets into your brain.”Long-term studies report that kids of color show lower self-esteem as a result of the on-screen images, while white boys show an increase in self-esteem. And these effects last into adulthood. The good news is that when kids watch programming that’s more inclusive, self-esteem in marginalized groups increases without diminishing white children’s self-esteem, says Ramon Stephens, executive director of The Conscious Kid.The key to changing how your kids’ screen time impacts their implicit biases lies in understanding that it’s happening, recognizing it when you see it, and taking concrete steps to counteract it."When parents and caregivers are intentional about naming and disrupting biases [in media], they take an active role in modeling what anti-racism and solidarity looks like,” explains Stephens. “They have an opportunity to build their child’s ability to spot inequity and take action.”The idea that racist ideas in children come only from explicitly racist parents is a myth, Stephens says.“Parents don't have to necessarily do anything for those biases in their kids to start, because kids receive so many messages from the broader social context and internalize them,” he says. “It’s something that we're constantly being surrounded with and just kind of breathing in.”History has repeatedly proved that. The Clark and Clark “doll tests” from the 1940s was one of the first to demonstrate how implicit bias impacts children. Given a choice of dolls with different skin colors, both Black and white children gravitated toward the white doll and attributed positive characteristics like “pretty” and “nice” to it. Almost 70  years later, in 2010, another version of the test resulted in almost identical results.Similar experiments in the decades since the Clark and Clark studies have asked children to draw themselves as princesses. Kids of color often skipped the task because they said their “skin was too dark to be a princess,” Stephens says.But that attitude changes when the notion is disrupted on-screen, Briscoe-Smith says. In fact, research suggests that when depictions of princesses shifted in recent years to become more inclusive and focus on character traits (for instance, Frozen’s Elsa and Anna relying on themselves rather than a Prince Charming) over physical beauty, little girls expanded their thinking as well. Experts believe that similar changes in kids’ media can increase positive perceptions of race as well.Choosing shows that have Black, Asian, or other characters of color is a step forward, but if those characters aren’t important to the story, they can be just as damaging as their absence, Stephens says. Tokenism, stereotypes, power imbalances, and implied hierarchies based on wealth can all factor into the biased messages your child is receiving.It’s why diversity in programming is especially important for kids who live in highly segregated communities (white or communities of color), Stephens says.“A lot of kids have their first interactions with diverse communities through television,” he says. “If you keep seeing the same roles and the same narratives, that also shapes the ways in which you see other communities.” For instance, if your child watches shows in which white characters are “the smart ones” and the Black characters excel at sports, they might begin to believe that’s normal.“Much like adults, what children see [on screens] is what they believe the world really is,” Briscoe-Smith says. “As children continually see certain messages about who’s in power, or how people are treated, it becomes part of the information that they use to understand how the world works.”Kids may test out explicit bias early (using derogatory slurs, for example), but that often tempers off around middle school when they learn it’s not appropriate. But implicit bias (making assumptions based on race, gender, or other factors) continues into adulthood—unless it’s intentionally disrupted by parents.Parents can start by introducing kids to shows that have diverse stories and communities. (Experts recommend shows like Doc McStuffins, Craig of the Creek, Hero Elementary, and Molly of Denali; Common Sense Media also highlights TV shows, movies, and apps that have positive role models and representations.) To normalize multi-racial characters, comment on why what the child is watching is great: “I love seeing that character—he always has something good to say about his friends.”Briscoe-Smith says co-viewing shows with your children can also help counteract implicitly biased messages they might be receiving. She advises parents to take a long-term approach that engages kids in conversations about what they’re watching. Some of the issues to look out for include:• Stereotypes: Are kids of color portrayed stereotypically? (Is the Asian child shy or the Black child tough?)• Power imbalances: Does characters of color have major speaking roles? Are they always being helped by the dominant community? (For instance, is the person of color “there” but never involved in resolving a situation? Or do they need help from the white character to fix problems?)• Tokenism: Is there only one friend or teacher who’s a person of color?• Reality checks: How is this show different from real life? How is it the same? (Do the people of color your family knows behave this way?)• Self-esteem: How did this show make you feel? (Does watching how the characters are represented make you feel uncomfortable? Afraid? Sad? Recognizing and identifying those emotions can help your child self-regulate their media intake now and in the future.)The goal, Briscoe-Smith says, is to create critical thinkers who recognize racial inequality when they see it—on-screen and off—and develop a habit of questioning what they’re seeing whether you’re in the room or not.“Ultimately,” she says, “we want them to be able to say, ‘I’m not going to watch that because it doesn't make me feel great when I do.’”The reason that kids don’t grow up believing that Wylie Coyote’s anvil antics are the way to settle disputes is because children’s lived experiences don’t reinforce that idea, Briscoe-Smith says. But implicit racial biases can have lasting power when kids receive messages about racial inferiority through their lived experiences—such as not seeing Black executives in a parent’s office—that support what they’re seeing on TV.That’s why Stephens says it’s important for your family’s real life to contradict negative images your child might be watching on screens and reflect positive ones. That includes encouraging cross-racial friendships and reviewing your school curriculum to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion.When you do that, “you're starting to build your child's own wealth of knowledge that they can draw from when they run into stereotypes or problematic experiences,” Stephens says. So when they see a racist idea in a show they’re watching, “they can say, ‘I know folks from those communities. I know that that's not the only story of that community that I've seen.’”And even when parents do all the right things to prevent implicit bias in their kids, it’s still not unusual for a child to say or believe something racist. Experts say that’s the power of implicit bias—and that parents should continue fighting it.“No matter your upbringing or the life that you've lived, you will have biases, and they're going to affect what you do,” Conway says. “Putting a little bit of time and effort into thinking about what those are and how to work against them every day is something that we all need to do.”",
"When Hannah Maree Eun Pinski was nine years old, she was sharing middle names with friends in the school cafeteria. One of her white classmates “joked” that her Korean middle name was weird, then pulled at the corners of her eyes, and said, “I guess it makes sense since you have ugly eyes.” Everyone at the table laughed.Pinksi, who was the only person of color at the table, says her classmate likely didn’t intend to be hurtful, only to make a joke. But over a decade later, it remains a vivid memory.“That was the first time I remember someone saying something like that to me, and it really hit home,” she says. “I thought, well, if everyone agreed with her, then it must be true. I still don't feel confident about how I look.”Microaggressions are often subtle, everyday exchanges that convey bias toward people based on race, gender identity, religion, age, ability, class, or membership to another group. And childhood microaggressions can have lifelong effects, says psychologist Kevin Nadal, author of several books on microaggressions.“Research over the past 10 years has demonstrated microaggressions are related to a lot of different health and physical outcomes, including depression and anxiety, trauma, physical health issues, sleep issues, alcohol use, and body image issues,” he says.Microaggressions are sometimes so subtle that even adults don’t always realize they’re using them. So children, who are naturally curious, may not understand what a microaggression is or how their actions affect others. For example, without understanding what could be hurtful to another child, they may ask, Where is your family from? Why do you have an accent? Why is your skin a different color than mine?“Those are all questions of curiosity, but the impact of those questions on the other child builds up,” says Roberto Montenegro, a psychiatrist at Seattle Children’s Hospital. “Microaggressions are not only about hurt feelings—they’re coded messages of disapproval based on identity.”Here’s how parents can help their kids identify, correct, and prevent microaggressions.One of the best ways parents can help their kids understand microaggressions is to educate themselves first, Montenegro says. Start by reading books and articles on race and racism to understand the experiences of marginalized groups and how systemic oppression influences society. Although microaggressions aren’t only race-based, this can help parents understand bias more broadly.Studies show that children associate racial groups with certain traits as early as age three—long before parents are talking to them about race. So though it’s natural for kids to ask why another person’s skin color is different from theirs, why a classmate has two mommies, or why people have different accents, that curiosity can become harmful when it makes others feel like they’re different and therefore not as good.“Two of the most common messages microaggressions send are, ‘You're different or less than me,’ and ‘You don't belong here,’” Montenegro says.Instead, he advises teaching children how to express their curiosity in different ways—and in appropriate contexts. (“Instead of asking someone if you can touch her hair, tell her she has beautiful hair.”) He also encourages parents to stress why it’s important to avoid “otherness” in language. (“People have different skin tones and they’re all beautiful. But we don’t ask people why their skin color is different from ours, because that might sound like you think different is bad, and that’s hurtful.”)“With young children, it's helpful to equate microaggressions to hurtful language or actions that relate to someone's identity,” Montenegro says. “It's often unintentional, but it still hurts the other person.”Finally, he suggests encouraging kids to ask you questions about differences instead of the person they’re curious about. Then continue to have open conversations about our differences—and why they should be celebrated.A child’s microaggression usually isn’t intentionally hurtful. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be addressed. Montenegro recommends addressing the behavior privately and immediately.First, identify the behavior and describe it. (“The teacher told me that you didn’t let John play in your group at recess because you couldn't understand him. I want you to know that's hurtful language.”)Then, try asking the child what they think it was like for the other child to hear that, Montenegro says. After the child engages in perspective-taking, validate them. ("We all do this, but we have to retrain our brain not to make judgments based on what people look like or sound like.”)“We want to teach them about empathy, so remind them what it's like to be hurt or teased by others,” Nadal says. “Make it a teachable moment.”Keep in mind that microaggressions aren’t always verbal, Nadal says. It can also take the form of exclusion, which is more difficult to identify. He recommends asking questions. (“Who did you play with at recess? Did someone else want to play with you that you didn’t want to play with?”)“I don't think kids are necessarily consciously aware of excluding,” Nadal adds. “But you might get a sense that a kid is only playing with other boys or only playing with other white kids.” Parents can ask questions and then make suggestions without accusing or shaming a child. (“I noticed you're playing a lot with these kids. Have you ever wanted to play with so and so?”)Kids don’t always open up about microaggressions, but Nadal says normalizing conversations can help.“One really helpful thing is to say things like, tell me three things that you liked about today, and tell me three difficult things,” he says. “It gives you the opportunity to hear more details as opposed to asking general questions and getting a general response.”It’s natural for parents to feel defensive, but Nadal recommends helping the child process the emotional impact before jumping into problem-solving. “Try to mitigate or challenge any internalized messages that they may have experienced as a result of the incident,” he says. For example, if someone made a hurtful comment about their hair, remind them their hair is beautiful.You can also explain that sometimes kids make fun of others because they’re insecure or have learned hurtful messages about people who are different. “Provide them with as much explanation as possible so that that child doesn't internalize,” Nadal says. "If they internalize it, that becomes a traumatic sort of moment that they hold on to. Maybe that leads to issues with self-esteem about their looks, their racial identity, or gender or sexual orientation because they believe these messages are true.”Books can help, too. “Children can see themselves in stories, learn that they're not alone, and that other kids have had similar experiences,” Montenegro says. “That helps with empowerment and with setting boundaries.” Some books he recommends include Don’t Touch My Hair, 10,000 Dresses, and The Name Jar.In some instances, parents might need to step in and talk to a teacher or the parents of the other child. “Before that happens, encourage your child to stand up for themselves or seek additional support from teachers or friends,” Nadal says. “That gives them a sense of independence and resilience in being able to solve their own problems.”One of the most important things parents can do is be good models—that means acknowledging their own biases instead of pushing them away. Montenegro says that includes recognizing and acknowledging when you use a microaggression so the child will start mimicking that behavior of self-correction, curiosity, and growth. (“That was hurtful—why did I say that?”)“Children repeat a lot of things that they hear adults say, even though they don't really know what they're saying,” Nadal says. “When children say things like ‘That's so gay’ or ‘That's retarded’ to convey that something’s different or they don't like it, this often is biased language that they may have heard from adults.”Nadal encourages parents to have open conversations with their kids about discrimination and privilege, social justice, systems of oppression, and biases, no matter their background. This teaches children early to celebrate and accept diversity, but at the same make them aware that racism, sexism, ableism, and classism exists.“Then kids can externalize it and say, ‘There isn't something wrong with me, or wrong with people different from me,’ but rather this is an example of the systems we live in,” he says.“Instead of teaching them we live in a colorblind world, we should teach them that we live in a world in which people are treated differently,” Nadal adds. “Instead of trying to teach them that this utopian world exists, teach them how we can try to change that world.”",
"Encourage your kids to foster diverse friendships—and know that they'll all be able to play together again soon.The stories are troubling—and sometimes frightening.In California, a child grabbed a Singaporean woman by her arm and said, “Go back to your country. You are the reason my father died.” In New Jersey, a group of young men stalked a Korean couple pushing their one-year-old granddaughter in a stroller, saying they were all infected with coronavirus. And in the United Kingdom, an eight-year-old girl tells her best friend, who’s Chinese, that her mom won’t let her play with Chinese children anymore because they’re “virus carriers.”These types of accounts have been on the rise ever since late 2019 outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Between February 9 and March 7, news articles reporting hate incidents against people of Asian descent around the world increased by 50 percent, according to San Francisco State University Asian-American Studies, which partnered with the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action to launch Stop AAPI Hate to collect anti-Asian hate incidents. Since March 19, the center has received reports of nearly 2,000 incidents. And according to the Center for Public Integrity, 30 percent of all Americans and 60 percent of Asian Americans had witnessed an Asian person being blamed for COVID-19.As an American-born Chinese and a mother, I believe it’s critical to begin a conversation with our kids about why it’s wrong to blame Asians for the coronavirus. Children are already being exposed to this bias, according to Russell Jeung, chair of Asian-American Studies at San Francisco State University: 11 percent of the incidents collected by Stop AAPI Hate in one month involved youth as targets, perpetrators, or bystanders. In the cases in which adults were present, only 11 percent intervened.“Perhaps [children] aren’t intentionally being racist, but racist viewpoints are shaping how they think and see the world,” he says. “Kids have to unlearn this, and learn how to decouple the virus from a group of people.”Here’s some advice from the experts on how to do that.Xenophobia is defined by Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, as “the irrational fear and hatred of foreigners—and those perceived to be foreign.” And that fear can be easily exploited during times of high anxiety.“We've targeted and scapegoated immigrants as ‘outsiders’ during pandemics, peace and war, good and bad economic times, and periods of high and low immigration,” says Lee, who also wrote America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States.Diseases have even been labeled after a geographic location or race, which inspired the 2015 World Health Organization guidelines against such practices. The 1918 H1N1 virus that killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide was known as the “Spanish flu.” A 2009 influenza outbreak was referred to as “Mexican swine flu.” And of course, many have labeled COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan flu.”“Every pandemic needs a scapegoat,” says Josephine Kim, a Harvard University lecturer and faculty member at the Center for Cross-Cultural Student Emotional Wellness at Massachusetts General Hospital. “This is how we create distance between ourselves and the disease to say, ‘That’s not like us.’”Although most parents try to model anti-racist behavior, sometimes unintentional incidents happen—and sometimes those can come from children. The first thing parents should look out for? Their own behavior.Recently a former Harvard classmate sent me a video reporting that the FBI had arrested a professor accused of being paid by a Wuhan research lab. Reading a caption with the video, I blurted out in front of my kids, “Coronavirus is a bio attack planned by China.” In reality, the clip was a combination of actual news reports cleverly mixed with false captions. I talked with my kids about the hoax and alerted my classmate. She apologized, saying that in her anxious state she hadn’t checked her source and would retract the misinformation.Still, who knows how many parents did the same thing without realizing the video was a hoax—and unintentionally spread misinformation to their kids. “Remember that children are watching,” Kim says. “Think about how you react when you witness discrimination of others, and what action is taken or is not taken. What off-the-cuff comments are casually made about others in the privacy of your home?”No matter how careful parents are, kids might pick up racist behavior—even if it’s subtle—from various forms of media. Start by screening what children watch—whether on TV or social media—and talking to them about what they’ve seen.“Have age-appropriate, open discussions about what they saw or read,” says pediatrician Hanita Oh-Tan of Fairfax, Virginia. “How did that make you feel? How do you think that made the subject of the story feel? What would you do if that happened to you or someone you know? What do you want to ask me?”Renee Tajima-Peña, professor of Asian-American Studies at UCLA and series producer of the PBS documentary Asian Americans, recommends exposing kids to toys, video games, TV shows, and movies that depict Asians as protagonists who are “fully dimensional and therefore relatable to the viewer.” Parents can also point out subtle racism: for instance, if the villains have darker skin or if an Asian character can’t speak English well. Basically, show kids that Asians are just like them.When children pick up on stereotypes and falsehoods because of COVID-19, uncomfortable questions for parents might arise. Common questions could be “Do all Chinese people have coronavirus?” or “Why doesn’t so-and-so like Chinese people?” It’s important to address them honestly.First, arm children with facts. After a New Jersey boy told a classmate that he must have coronavirus because he was Chinese, their fourth-grade teacher facilitated a discussion about what viruses are, how vaccines work, what discrimination is, and how no evidence exists to show that a person’s ethnicity has anything to do with contracting the disease. Parents can also have these honest conversations, using news stories to discuss stereotypes and discrimination. “If kids don’t know they exist, they won’t know what to do if they or their friends are faced with an act of hatred, big or small,” Oh-Tan says.Teaching kids facts also means helping them distinguish truth from falsehoods. That can be tricky these days, but one thing to have them look for is if an entire group of people has been blamed for something. “That's a red flag to prompt a conversation with an adult,” Kim says. “When [people] are presented in an inferior way, that's not fair. Kids understand fairness at an early age. We can harness a child’s keen sense of fairness to encourage empathy.”To comfort children confused about racist behavior they’ve witnessed, explain to the child what that person might have been feeling. “Maybe that person’s parents are angry and worried about the virus,” says Satsuki Ina, a child therapist specializing in collective trauma, especially racism. “Tell them COVID-19 has made people really upset, and they want to blame someone. Then help your child prepare a response: What can you say or do that makes you feel strong?”Help children see people as individuals, not as an entire group of people. For instance, say a child has made a racist comment about an Asian classmate named Tommy. “You might ask, ‘What about Tommy is upsetting you? Did Tommy hurt you?’” says Ina, who was born in a concentration camp for Japanese Americans during World War II. “Once you personalize, it moves away from generalization, which is what racism does.”That can also help children see how hurtful racist comments can be to an individual. One Californian seven-year-old’s response to a hurtful comment was to write a letter: “Someone said that he doesn’t like China and Chinese people. This made me feel sad because I’m Chinese.… When you say that you don’t like Chinese people, you’re saying that you do not like me. I did not start this virus.” Talking about feelings—whether by exposing children directly to thoughts like this, having them verbalize what they think the hurt person might be feeling, or asking them to write about how they’d feel if someone said something hurtful to them—can show them how wrong words can be.In time, coronavirus infections will likely start to slow—and perhaps the related hate incidents against people of Asian descent will slow with it. But xenophobia is something that’s always with us, which is why it’s important for parents to teach their kids to fight it. “Address it early on,” Tajima-Peña says. “Hate grows exponentially, and it’s hard to scale back.”",
"Rae Wynn-Grant tracks lions through the Tanzanian savanna and bears across North American forests. As an African-American large carnivore ecologist—and mother of a daughter—the Nat Geo fellow has an important perspective on getting girls and kids of color excited about STEM. She talked to Nat Geo Family about her experience as a Black woman in science, why diversity in STEM is so important, and how to get children excited about learning.NAT GEO FAMILY: What made you want to become a wildlife biologist?RAE WYNN-GRANT: My family didn’t have a TV but my grandparents did, so I’d go to their house and watch a lot of nature shows. I was captivated by the wild animals. I’d watch these white British guys walking through the jungle with all this knowledge about the animals, and I thought, “I want to be a nature show host when I grow up.” I had no idea until I was a little older that I was being introduced to science.NGF: And that’s when you decided what you wanted to do?RWG: Yes, but I wasn’t sure if I could be a wildlife biologist. I didn’t get very good grades in math and science, and I really struggled with self-esteem growing up. What I needed was some encouragement and self-confidence, but I wasn’t always getting that in the public school districts I attended, in California and Virginia. I think that’s a problem for a lot of kids of color, as well as girls.NGF: You were accepted to Emory University in Atlanta and ended up being the first African American to major in its environmental sciences program. What was that like?RWG: Honestly it was an uncomfortable adjustment. Emory University is actually pretty diverse, so on campus I didn't feel uncomfortable with my Blackness. But when I got into the environmental science department, it was really isolating. There's a lot of pressure when you’re the only person who looks like you.NGF: How did your experiences growing up in urban areas affect that?RWG: My family, like a lot of others around me, didn’t have a lot of access to the outdoors. My understanding of Black culture did not include spending time in nature. Many of the other students in my department had been in forests, they had seen wildlife. So I felt like they had an advantage. It wasn’t just my race and my background but also my experience that made me feel super different. And those are all intertwined.NGF: Why is it important to give children of color these experiences?RWG: I worked with a program in New York City taking Black and brown kids out into nature. And it wasn’t about, “We’re going to make you love the outdoors.” It was about empowering them to make decisions based on experience. They might go hiking and decide the outdoors is not for them. But that’s part of equality. It’s about giving kids the opportunity to make a choice from a place of equal opportunity.NGF: When was the first time you had a Black science professor?RWG: I accepted this intense study abroad program in southern Kenya in which I’d basically be living outside for a semester—and I hadn’t even been camping before! I had no idea who the professors would be, but when I got there it turned out they were all Black Kenyans. It was icing on the cake.NGF: How would your experience have been different if you had been exposed to African-American scientists as a child?RWG: I never would’ve questioned whether I could even be a wildlife biologist. There’s a tremendous responsibility when you have to forge your own path, and it can be terrifying. And fear keeps people—especially young people—from doing a lot of things. But suddenly there were people who looked like me, who had the job that I was aspiring to have, which gave me the self-confidence I was missing. So more representation of Black or women scientists would’ve helped me feel like I had a place.NGF: Do you still struggle with being one of the few African-American female scientists?RWG: People sometimes have expectations of what a scientist should look like, and I don’t usually meet those expectations. That’s tough to push through. To break down those harmful stereotypes—"this is what a scientist looks like"—is really important. I mean, it’s really important to just respect people. Human dignity is the most important thing.NGF: Why is it so important to have diversity in STEM fields like wildlife biology?RWG: My work is about saving animals from extinction, and so many other scientists are also trying to save the planet so we can survive. We don’t have time to be caught up in stereotypes or barriers. Right now we have a bunch of people who aren’t involved because of barriers they face. That makes no sense. For such a critical mission, we need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to help solve these problems.NGF: How do we get there with our kids?RWG: You can’t teach your kids something that you don’t believe in. So model the right behavior for children. Use whatever privilege you have—and we all have some kind of privilege—to be there as an ally for someone else. And though it’s great to teach kids not to be racist, it’s also important to show them how to be anti-racist as well. Show them how to intervene when racism is happening, whether it’s overt or subtle.NGF: Are there other ways parents can encourage diversity in their kids’ lives?RWG: It’s really easy to start local. I studied bears in Montana, which is a pretty white place. But all different kinds of people live there: super-wealthy landowners, low-income people living off the land, Native American groups who’ve been discriminated against. You don’t have to take your kids all over the world to expose them to the different ways we’re human. By learning from history, we can build a beautiful future.NGF: How can parents be mindful of supporting other kids, whether in STEM or other activities?RWG: I remember going to a meeting with a college professor, and I was really nervous because I was so embarrassed about my low grades. But the first thing he said was, “It’s very clear you’ve worked hard on this.” And my anxiety melted away. Acknowledging that effort instead of the performance can really go a long way in boosting a child’s confidence. We do it for our own children, and we should do it for other children too. When you see kids trying hard, or even trying just a little bit, try complimenting the effort instead of the outcome. I think that could really level the playing field in a lot of ways.The National Geographic Society, committed to illuminating and protecting the wonder of our world, funded Explorer Rae Wynn-Grant’s work.

"Whether you’re in a city or a national park, have everyone close their eyes and listen. Ask each family member to name a sound he or she can hear: singing birds, barking dogs, rustling leaves, splashing water. Nature sounds are best, but identifying any noise—car alarms, slamming doors, people talking—can help kids learn to focus and be more in tune with the world around them.Zooming in for a close-up look at dirt, rocks, tree bark, and even blades of grass seriously ups the cool factor of any green space.On your next trip, pack a tape measure and a tree field guide or app to try this trick, whether you’re in a city park or on a hike in the woods. 1. Choose a tree and identify the species and its growth factor. “That’s a measure of tree growth per year,” says Scott Ferrenberg, assistant professor of biology at New Mexico State University. 2. Measure four and a half feet up from the ground. 3. At that spot, measure around the tree to get the tree’s circumference in inches. 4. Divide the circumference by 3.14. The number you get is the diameter. (Sounds complicated, but you got this.) 5. Multiply the diameter by the tree’s growth factor and—ta-da!—you’ve got the estimated age of the tree.Turn some of their favorite shots into postcards to send to friends and family.Check them off as kids spot them. Create a list of things to look for: nuts, feathers, flowers, leaves, insects, animal tracks, poop, etcMake a shadow clock. Have your kid stand in the same spot every hour and take photos where his or her shadow falls. At the end of the day, scroll through the photos together to see how the shadow moved hour to hour, and how it grew and shrank.Find an off-road orchard or farm to teach kids about locally grown produce as well as healthy eating. From May to October you’ll likely find something—such as strawberries, blueberries, cherries, apples, or peaches—that the kids can harvest and eat fresh from a tree, bush, or vine (after rinsing, of course!).The people you’re visiting are sure to have Hula-Hoops, jump ropes, beach balls, water balloons, lawn chairs, etc., to create a fun outside challenge with.Challenge everyone to name cloud types: cirrus, cumulus, stratus, and nimbus. Or see who finds the moon first. It’s often visible during the day—especially the week before or after a full moon—but it can be tricky to identify in a clear blue sky.After cleaning up your own mess, send a little extra kindness nature’s way by asking everyone to find and toss at least 10 additional pieces of trash in the waste or recycling bin.Instead of sitting on the sidelines recording your kids’ surfing or rock climbing or whatever outdoorsy vacation lesson they want to take on, sign up for a family class. Learning and playing outside together lets kids know that you’re never too old to have fun in nature.Shift your family’s focus off their screens and on to the world outside. Bring along drawing materials so kids can sketch what they see out the window. The actual view—pool, skyscrapers, mountains, beach—doesn’t matter. Looking outside and observing what’s around them is what counts.Divide into teams (like kids versus adults, or back seat versus front seat) and earn points by spotting examples of nature bursting out in weird or unexpected places: a flower growing through a crack in a sidewalk, a swallow’s nest under a bridge, or kudzu covering a power pole.Show kids that nature is an all-weather play space. Observe what’s living in puddles. Count the earthworms that magically appear when it rains. Or just catch raindrops on your tongue!When visiting relatives, use their yard as a canvas for art made from found materials like stones, fallen leaves, flower petals, sticks, and bird feathers. No picking, plucking, digging, or otherwise disturbing any living thing. And all sculptures stay outside. “Challenge children to use their imagination and build something they think needs to exist,” says Catherine Widner, an art teacher at Jim Bridger and Spring Lane Elementary schools in Salt Lake City. “One of my students constructed a boat out of sticks and used kudzu for the sail. It was amazing!”Put the children in charge of the theme park map and follow their lead. Sounds scary, but reading a map and looking for landmarks helps kids navigate the outside world—always a good thing.On dog walks, bring two bags: one for poop and one for kids to collect leaves, nuts, sticks, grass, rocks, etc. When you return, sit in a circle and take turns identifying the things in the bag by touch. (Just don’t get it mixed up with the poop bag!)Make it a bug safari instead! Kids will flex their curiosity muscles when they carefully collect, observe, and release insects. Plus the interaction helps everyone feel more comfortable in nature, says Jennifer Roder, education director at Ijams Nature Center in Knoxville. Any green space is fair game for a bug safari. (Just be sure to check any local, state, or national park rules.) All you need is a basic bug net (available at most sporting goods stores), some covered plastic containers with air holes poked in, and a field guide or app to ID the bugs. After a quick study, put the critters back where you found them. “We’re venturing into their home to explore,” Roder says. “We want to be good guests.”When faced with flight delays, traffic jams, or hotel check-in lines, take turns asking “W” nature questions: Why is the sky blue? Where do bats go during the day? What are pinecones for? Use your phone to look up the correct answer after giving everyone a chance to make an educated—or wildly creative—guess.If it’s in a historic cemetery, then yes! Besides birds, trees, and flowers to observe, historic cemeteries offer cool opportunities for history and even math lessons—all while adding a bit of creepy fun kids will enjoy. Here are questions to consider as the family goes on this slightly eerie hike. 1. What was going on in the world when this person was alive? 2. How old was the person when he or she passed away? 3. What do you think the person did for a living?",
"Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant, a large carnivore ecologist who focuses on bears, describes them in a very human way. "They're just like people," she says. “They just love to hang out."In short, Wynn-Grant loves bears. She works with some of the most recognized species in the world: grizzlies and black bears. As recognizable as they are — in cartoons, books, and movies — that prominence does not always translate to admiration, especially in communities in or near bear habitat.Human conflicts with bears are a reality in these areas. From small property damage to livestock predation, these incidents can seriously affect a property owner's livelihood.Part of Wynn-Grant's work is focused on eliminating negative interactions like these. She goes into communities and brings people information about where bears are, where they are traveling, and how locals can protect themselves. Translating data she has painstakingly collected into actionable recommendations, readily understandable by the average person, is a critical component of her work.And this work does not happen in a vacuum."My work might seem pretty specific to one animal and one place,” she says. “But it gives me an ability to make recommendations for any type of conservation, anywhere. Most conservation is being done in places where there are people, people who need to build towns and cities and highways and roads. So getting it right here means we can probably get it right somewhere else."Wynn-Grant is currently focused on black bears in the American West. At one point, black bears in this part of the country were severely threatened. Now, their populations are stable."I have a really big end goal," she says. “For this ecosystem to achieve balance. We're not quite there yet and so I really like to think that my work can help us get to that place in the future."",
"You’re trying to figure out your 18th video conference call of the day—and you’re not the only one who’s been on her screen for hours. Despite your best efforts to encourage reading and crafting while maintaining some semblance of screen time limits, your kids still just want to veg out on videos. Are your children’s brains going to turn to mush by the time this is all over?As the coronavirus pandemic continues to upend family routines across the globe, it’s also intensifying our relationship with media in unprecedented ways. But to all the parents wracked with worry about letting their kids watch TV while cooped up at home, experts say: Relax.Even though some studies have shown links between heavy media use and delays in language, increased rates of obesity, and sleep problems, experts agree that now is not the time to fret over such research. “There’s no reason to add to the stress of this current moment with more guilt about using technology,” says Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of Michigan and the author of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines for media use. “Guilt doesn’t help us plan. Instead, think about: What does my family need right now?”Caroline Knorr, senior parenting editor for Common Sense Media, echoes a similar sentiment: Make your focus your relationship with your children, not how much they’re consuming media.“As long as you’re having meaningful interactions with your kids throughout the day, it’s OK,” she says.Rethinking ‘screen time’ First, Radesky would like to hit reset on the term “screen time:” It doesn’t really define the fraught relationship between technology and your children. The focus, she says, shouldn’t be the duration of time, but how technology is inserting itself into our lives and routines. “Is it helpful or not helpful?” she asks.After all, not all screen time is the same: “Skyping with grandparents is different from watching a cartoon,” she adds, explaining that social interactions aren’t even considered “screen time” by the AAP.That’s why Radesky suggests that parents schedule screen time for different purposes, such as learning, social connections, and positive entertainment, while also planning off-screen time for activities such as cooking, getting outside, and spending time with pets.Radesky hasn’t come up with a pithy term to replace screen time, but “intentional media use” comes close, she says. “If your child is going to be using technology for a lot of the day, try to make it more social, positive, and problem-solving,” she says. That could be video-chatting with cousins or classmates, or watching television programs that engage children’s thinking skills. For younger kids, that could mean Sesame Street or shows on PBS Kids. Older kids might enjoy Kid President: Are We There Yet? or Steven Universe: Future. Nat Geo Kids also has more than 30 nonfiction short-form video series. (Go to Common Sense Media’s resource hub for families during the pandemic.)Don’t be a micromanager The most effective way to manage kids’ screen time is to essentially lead from behind. Radesky advises giving them parameters but also some say in their daily lives.The first step is to be transparent and give your children some context for why they should regulate their screen use. “We’re going to make sure it doesn’t take up our whole day because we want to do more together” is much more acceptable to kids than just “Put down that tablet.”With that context established, a parent might then give their kid the autonomy to decide when she watches a TV show and when she goes outside for a walk. (NatGeo@Home provides online and offline learning opportunities for kids and families.)“They enjoy being able to self-determine,” Radesky says. Providing this opportunity to kids also develops their executive functioning—crucial mental skills that include making decisions, following directions, critical thinking, and controlling one’s behavior.One rule not open to negotiation, however: Children should put tablets or computers out of sight when they’re not in use. Radesky says letting a child carry his device with him around the house can entice him to look at it whenever he’s feeling bored.Use media as a jumping-off point Both experts recommend using media as a springboard for real-life activities. For instance, parents can suggest plenty of books about Minecraft that their children can read, Knorr says.“I look for things that are more participatory and help kids use their imagination,” she says. Recommendations include the Daily Vroom app for preschoolers and the Grasshopper coding app.Especially for younger children, Radesky recommends transferring what they see in 2D to 3D. For example, after watching a nature documentary, the child can then act out a scene with stuffed animals. “We want their minds to drive what happens next,” she says.For older kids, Knorr suggests that parents talk to their children about the content of video games or apps they’re using, as well as how that media makes them feel. “Encouraging kids to think critically about the media they’re exposed to” means that parents stay informed and that kids feel like they’re not simply consuming media just because all their friends are doing it.Staying in touch with emotions Though media can be a positive force, too often it serves as an emotional escape. When overwhelmed, both parents and kids might distract themselves with technology to avoid their feelings.To prevent screens from becoming a coping strategy for children, make sure to continue to talk to them about their feelings. “You don’t want technology to displace important moments when your child might instead need to say, I’m really mad, I’m really worried about Grandpa and Grandma, or I’m really overwhelmed,” Radesky says. “It’s so much easier to parent your children when you understand what drives their emotions and behavior.”Parents should also be alert for any changes in their child’s behavior during this uncertain time, such as becoming more withdrawn or angry, or refusing to do schoolwork. These are signs they might be consuming too much media. “You know your kid best,” Knorr says.But even the best advice won’t prevent a technology give-in when you’re logging on to that 18th video conference call. And that’s OK. Says Radesky: “I would say to exhausted parents in survival mode to take it easy on themselves.”And maybe watch a Hulu show of their own.",
"Like most elementary and middle school-age children, Jennifer Aycock’s four kids, ages six to 13, love a good story. And though reading is a cherished family activity, the Aycock family doesn’t always rely on books.“When we’re telling stories out loud, you can see the kids engage differently,” says Aycock, a longtime teacher who incorporates storytelling in her classroom. “They listen more intently, and it seems to really spark their imagination.”Scientific research on how kids’ brains respond to storytelling is relatively new, says Katie Knutson, board chair of the National Storytelling Network and a professional storyteller. “[But] it’s clear that there are significant cognitive and academic benefits to both story listening and storytelling.”Telling stories is nothing new and has been around since before the written language. The practice didn’t just communicate information—like that an area was dangerous because of predators—but also preserved history, honored religious traditions, and entertained.They also create cultural cohesion. “Often stories are told in families to connect the next generation to those who have gone before, or to help kids develop the values that are most important in their culture,” Knutson says.Weaving this creative tradition into your household can foster cognitive, social, and emotional development, which many parents are concerned has been disrupted by COVID-19-related school closures and isolation. Here’s why storytelling is good for kids—and how parents can make it part of their family life.Although all kinds of story forms can provide great entertainment and convey valuable lessons, the ways kids process oral storytelling—whether they’re hearing a story or telling it themselves—elicits unique brain responses that are different from watching a television show, reading a book, or journaling.“Using MRI imaging, neuroscience research has demonstrated that when a listener is engrossed in a teller’s story enough to forget about their surroundings—a state called narrative transport—the functioning areas of the tellers' brains are [soon] mirrored in the listener's brain,” says Cathy Miyata, a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University and master storyteller. This phenomenon is known as neural coupling, which is unique to verbal communication.Oxytocin, a hormone involved in social bonding, may also play a role in narrative transport. “When children are told a meaningful or emotional story, their brain’s emotional response triggers a release of [the] neurochemical,” Miyata explains. Researchers suggest that this is because when listeners become emotionally engaged with the characters in a narrative, they are drawn deeper into that story world.This social bonding experience—between the storyteller, listener, and story characters—can also help facilitate empathy building in kids. “Exposing listeners to emotional and meaningful stories influences their ability to empathize and actually motivates them to demonstrate acts of caring,” Miyata says.“When children hear stories, they practice many of the skills they’ll need to be effective readers, writers, and critical thinkers,” Miyata says.For example, research suggests that listening to and telling stories to an audience (even of one) can boost kids’ cognitive engagement, ability to identify patterns, and story-sequencing skills, or being able to identify the components of a story like the beginning, middle, and end.Classroom studies in the United States and Canada also show a strong correlation between increased participation in storytelling—both as listener and teller—and children's problem-solving skills both at school and at home, adds Kendall Haven, a professional storyteller and author of Story Smart: Using the Science of Story to Persuade, Influence, Inspire and Teach.Then there are social benefits. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children have been isolated from friends and communities, and storytelling can help them feel more connected at home.That’s because sharing stories can help build the relationship between the storyteller and listener. “Reading to a child is a wonderful thing to do that has many, many benefits,” Miyata says. But storytelling without a script can remove barriers and open up the imagination. “When you take away the book, there’s just the parent and child, focused on one another, interacting and sharing in a unique experience.”Storytelling at home can help kids expand their imaginations and develop critical-thinking skills—but they might need some help to get started.“When we ask kids, and even adults, to make up a story, the options are so unlimited that it’s often a struggle to come up with anything at all,” Knutson says. “When we give a limit to their freedom, often in the form of a loose prompt, it frees them up to get wildly creative.”Model storytelling. With younger kids, a great way to get started is for parents to model storytelling. You can even make this a collaborative process. For example, Knutson recommends asking your child to think of a person, place, and thing, and then shaping a story around those details.Help kids practice active listening. Instead of asking children to sit quietly throughout the story, parents can ask kids to predict what’s coming next. (“What do you think she saw behind that big red door?”) Invite them to move their bodies with the story. (“Let’s all tiptoe like Camilla sneaking by the snake!”) Or help them participate in the telling process with simple call-and-response prompts. (“When I say no, you say way!”)Encourage kids to ask why. When kids are ready to start telling their own stories, Haven recommends encouraging kids to focus less on what happens and more on why it’s happening and what the motivations of the characters are. This is a kind of exercise in empathy. “Give details about why the character is doing what they’re doing, and ask listeners to make guesses as to the why’s in other parts of the story,” she says.Talk about feelings. Prompts that focus on specific emotions can also help kids incorporate their own experiences and ideas into stories. Parents might ask kids to share about a time they felt surprised, sad, scared, or excited, or to create a story about a birthday, a friendship, or starting something new.Ask good questions. While storytelling absolutely can be about dragons, fairies, or volcanoes, parents can help kids learn to tell good stories by helping them see stories in their everyday lives. Instead of asking “How was your day?” or “What did you learn at school?” parents can get creative. (“What did the food smell like in the cafeteria at lunch this afternoon?” or “Did anyone do anything unexpected in class today?”)Get the whole family involved. Especially when kids range in age, story games can spark creativity and allow everyone to participate at their level. Popular storytelling games include retelling games that require family members to use puppets or toys to recreate a story; challenges that involve retelling well-known stories with a new twist (think Little Red Riding Hood, but all the characters are people you know); and round-robin games, in which one person starts a story and others take turns completing it.Such round-robin games are familiar to Jennifer Aycock and her family. “It’s fun to see each person's personality come out in the part of the story they tell,” she says. “It’s a great way to connect as a family, learn more about what’s going on in each other’s lives, and have fun.”",
"Like many parents, Lyndie Chiou is sometimes flummoxed by the slang her three kids use. Cringey was a recent addition: “We were hanging out with some family friends and my 11-year-old told them how ‘cringey’ my favorite television shows were,” Chiou laughs. “I could guess from context what she was referring to.”If your child’s shifting vocabulary has left you scratching your head, too, there’s good news. Recent research indicates that using slang—invented, informal vocabulary—comes with real, measurable benefits for children: When schools incorporate slang into their curriculum, students become more flexible in engaging with the world around them. And when children can roll with the punches—linguistically speaking—improvements in reading comprehension, persuasive writing, lie detection, and empathy have been shown.Plus, it’s OK for kids to create variations in their spoken language “There's no one right way or wrong way to use language,” says Christine Mallinson, a linguist at the University of Maryland. “There are only different norms and conventions.”Those different conventions reflect the always-evolving nature of language—and that one “proper” way of speaking just isn’t appropriate for every single human. “Someone actually sat down and decided ‘This is the way language should be,’” says Lancaster University’s Sascha Stollhans, a co-leader of the UK-based Linguistics in Modern Foreign Languages project and author of the study above. But, he adds, people are more complex and diverse than that.That’s why slang has likely existed as long as speech has, says Tony Thorne, a lexicographer at King’s College who has been collecting and analyzing novel words for decades. In the historical record, slang first popped up among criminals in 15th-century Europe.“Slang was the language of hustlers, swindlers, and peddlers,” he says. “They all used slang because they wanted to hide what they were saying, and they had to invent new words for new kinds of crime.”As it did with medieval criminals, slang often originates within “in-groups,” or small groups of people who share bonds, interests, or activities. “They could do the same kind of job or are fans of the same sport; they could be gamers or follow a particular YouTube star,” Thorne says. Slang happens when existing words fall short in describing something novel or specific to that group.As a result, it can be wonderfully inventive, employing metaphor, imagery, and rich figurative language—like “hangry,” describing a hunger so intense it drives its sufferer to anger. And as slang jumps from group to group, its meaning often evolves: “Dude” morphed from meaning a well-dressed man in the 1890s to a term cowboys used for city slickers in the 1900s to a synonym for “guy” among the surfer crowd in the 1960s.Children, with their rapidly developing brains and new experiences, are particularly adept inventors of new words. Though Stollhans says it can be a way of asserting independence from parents and bonding with peers, this linguistic innovation is just another example of how play promotes their social and intellectual development.“Kids are playful with language, they love language, they’re creative with language,” Mallinson says. “And allowing kids that linguistic creativity and outlet is good for their wellbeing—it's a way for them to connect with others.”Even if it drives parents crazy, the use of slang has definite cognitive and emotional benefits for children.Playing with language fosters creativity and motivates kids to explore language’s potential. For instance, Mallinson’s children, ages seven and eight, assign nicknames to everyone in the family based on the first letter of their proper names or identifiers. In their familect (the language unique to a family), “mom” becomes “mots” and “dad” becomes “dots.”That creativity can have powerful results. According to Mallinson, children who have the ability to be creative with language are better at identifying deceptive language, tailoring messages to different people, and deciphering ambiguity.For instance, Stollhans asked students to find examples of slang in the tweets of political figures and consider how word choice helps them connect with certain groups of people. “Engaging with language critically might also help them spot fakeness or manipulative language,” he says.And that gives kids a critical awareness of how language is used in different contexts. The vocabulary, tone, and pronunciations kids would use with their parents, for example, might be completely different from the language they’d use while hanging out with friends.In fact, slang provides the perfect practice for untangling how words are defined versus what they might imply. Briana Richardson, a sixth-grade teacher in Mississippi, uses “bruh” to illustrate how context can dictate different meanings for the same word. “When kids come in and they see someone they haven’t seen in a while, ‘bruh’ means they’re excited,” she says. But in response to a parent giving them extra chores, “bruh” expresses exasperation and dismay.“We shift language all the time, every day, depending on who we're talking to, and what context we're in,” Mallinson says. When kids are trained to code switch, or adapt written or spoken language to their audience, they’re better equipped to evaluate the words of others, too.Despite the benefits, slang is often discouraged. What, exactly, are detractors afraid of?“A lot of adult pushback on kids’ language can come from home,” Mallinson says. “This might include everything from correcting their pronunciation to things like rebuking them for using non-standard phrases like ‘that sucks’ or ‘whatever.’”Others simply worry that slang decreases a child’s ability to learn standard grammar. But according to Stollhans’ research , incorporating slang into the curriculum actually improved students’ language skills. He theorizes that when students are exposed to diverse language examples, they’re more willing to try new words or phrases, and experiment with complex sentence structures.Sometimes the objection to slang has a darker—even racist or classist—purpose. For instance, Stollhans says that in the UK, slang from people who live in the north is often frowned upon by wealthier people farther south. And though many versions of English are spoken around the world, British or American is considered “standard.”“But why is British or American English more valuable than Indian English or English from the African continent?” Stollhans says.So how should you go about incorporating slang into your interactions with kids—and making sure they get all the benefits the creative language offers?Evelyn Lucero, a literacy coach at an international school in Vietnam, suggests that parents start by using children’s literature as a way to introduce slang into their conversations with kids. Her students recently read Ghost by Jason Reynolds, which is set in contemporary Brooklyn and includes language that kids might encounter in real life.Meanwhile, Andrea Zimmerman, an eighth-grade teacher in Tennessee, integrates slang into history projects, which can be easily replicated at home. In one creative activity, students write and perform the preamble to the Constitution in different informal styles. Imagining how Yoda or a Kardashian might interpret the text sparks laughs as well as a deeper understanding of this 230-year-old document. Families could do something similar with skit nights at home. Give kids a list of slang from your childhood and ask them to construct a scene around it. Then redo the scene for them using slang that they choose.And for parents who might balk at speaking a language variant that they’re not familiar with, Stollhans recommends just asking their kids to teach them. Kids love taking on the role of teacher, he notes, because it gives them an empowering sense of agency.“Language variation is a gift,” Mallinson says. “It’s a measure of who we are as humans.”",
"You exit a public bathroom with a long piece of toilet paper stuck to your shoe. Your daughter delivers a perfect impression of your mother-in-law, not realizing she was standing behind her. Cringe-inducing? Sure. Funny? You bet. And experts say that finding humor in situations like these—and even more super-stressful ones—is often the best way to handle it.“Humor often emerges as a response to transitions, pain, and tragedy,” explains Mary Kay Morrison, author of Using Humor to Maximize Living and founder of the Humor Academy at the Association for Applied Therapeutic Humor.“It serves as an invaluable coping response to the complex difficulties that kids face,” Morrison says. “Most people rely on their sense of humor to survive childhood challenges and the increased demands placed on them.”Research shows that laughter, like physical exercise, increases adrenaline and oxygen flow, releases feel-good endorphins, and pumps up heart rates. And like a good workout, that burst of energy eventually results in people feeling relaxed and calm.But it’s more than just a feeling. Other studies show that humor can help us be better problem solvers and decision makers. Brain scans of the cerebral cortex reveal that humor inspires creativity and aids with critical thinking skills. “Humor is an essential element for healthy brain development for both kids and adults,” Morrison says.And humor can be the defense mechanism our bodies need to become more resilient in the face of adversity. Being able to laugh during life’s challenges—whether it’s spilled milk or a stressful news cycle—can help us manage our emotional health. Morrison adds that the ability to see the humor in an upsetting situation is an invaluable skill that can decrease depression, loneliness, and anger in children and adults.Ready to tune up your kids’ funny bone? These tips can help.The giggles that come after a parent plays a game of peek-a-boo or blows raspberries with a baby are helping the child grow and learn. They’re making brain connections that are the building blocks for social skills.“Bright objects, big smiles, funny noises all tickle our brains,” says humorist, author, and Psychology Today contributor Gina Barreca, adding that as kids get older, parents can help them develop an understanding of more complex forms of funny (silly word play, for example).“And when a child’s humor moves to simple jokes (‘What do a tree and elephant have in common? They both have trunks!’) it moves into new intellectual territory altogether,” Barreca says. Being able to understand the funny part of that joke actually requires a child to make savvy connections between flora and fauna and understand the word play, she points out. Parents can help kids figure that out as they go.Not every kid (or parent) is a natural-born comedian. And that’s OK!Research shows that though our genetic makeup helps determine whether we’re funny (or not), our funny bone might also be related to what we’re exposed to. That means we can get better at it, Morrison says. “Humor is a skill that can be nurtured and developed, and both background and temperament contribute to an individual’s humor style and practice,” she says.Want to teach a kid humor? Show them funny things. Tell jokes, walk in a silly way, and laugh at yourself. Parents who demonstrate and reinforce the importance of humor are teaching their kids to appreciate it, too. Funny movies, silly videos, and squeaky toys have their place, but to help kids understand the humor you need to participate in the fun.“You can’t sit a kid down with a screen or a book or a toy and say, ‘Have a good time; this is really funny,’ and then walk away to do something else,” Barreca says. “You have to be there, laughing at the funny parts.”When hard times happen finding a reason to laugh can be tough. But it’s is a useful skill.“We are faced with change on a daily basis,” Morrison says. “When you can laugh about unexpected challenges or even your own health issues, you know you can face those challenges and even thrive in spite of them.”When your child is facing a tough issue, have them approach the situation with humor. Morrison suggests encouraging them to “find the funny.” For instance, if they’re frustrated about not seeing a friend over vacation, suggest they start a joke-a-thon over video chat. Another idea is to inspire them to imagine “how this could be worse.” Got lost on the way to the campsite? Imagine if it suddenly started snowing.Humor can also be used to diffuse a tough moment. Have a child stressing while studying? Help them make up a joke or funny poem to remember the material.And you don’t have to wait until the tough times appear. Morrison encourages kids to have a list of happiness strategies written down (sing-a-longs, puns, a favorite joke book) so that they know exactly where to turn to find the funny when they need it.“Finding time to play is an important component of self-care for both children and adults,” Morrison says.Watching TikTok or other social media videos may feel like an easy way to share a funny moment, but it isn’t the best way, Barreca says. Laughing at too many silly videos, she says, teaches kids that humor needs to be done for an audience and should be repeated until you get it right.“Doing a second-take is not how humor works in life,” she says, suggesting that families do something silly together instead of just watching videos. “Help make them creators and participants in humor, not merely consumers of it.”Morrison suggests adding swings, hula hoops, pogo sticks, scooters, and other fun activities to your family’s play arsenal. It’s apparently true that laughter is contagious—it’s your brain cells recognizing someone else having fun and realizing that you can, too. So seeing Mom on a pogo stick or Dad attempt a hula hoop record could start a chain reaction that gets everyone laughing.The line between a tasteless wisecrack and a funny quip can be hard to see when you’re little.Kids don’t instinctively understand sarcasm, satire, parody, or mockery, notes Barreca. “These concepts all depend on seeing the world from two angles simultaneously, meaning that it’s hard to learn to hear the humor in these remarks and even harder to learn how to invent such remarks and use them appropriately,” she says.That’s where you come in.“For kids, adults provide the laugh tracks,” Barreca says. “That’s how kids learn where the lines are—the hilarious lines, and the ones that cross a boundary—by listening to where the adults they love laugh.”If kids cross a line when trying out a joke, gently remind them that a joke isn’t funny if it bullies or causes someone pain.“When the impact of humor is hurtful, the humor is inappropriate, even if the intent was not to be harmful,” Morrison says. Kids, she says, need to be taught that how the impacted person feels is more important than whether the child intended to cause pain.With a parent’s gentle help, children can learn to tell the difference between harmful humor and truly funny stuff. And that’s important right now, both for the child as well as the folks she’s trying to make laugh.“A shared sense of humor—the kind that bonds a family and community—is not only appropriate during tough times,” Barreca says. “It’s essential.”",
"By the time Aelita Andre turned three, she had more art-world accolades than many professional artists. She started painting at nine months old, and galleries were showing her work when she was just two. Now 14 years old, the Australian abstract artist is still going strong; she just closed her most recent solo show in South Korea this month.Most children are innately creative and curious. But some are obsessively so and as adults end up transforming their field—or the world. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was composing music by four; Pablo Picasso drew on anything he could from toddlerhood. And though she’s not quite a household name, Catherine Beni graduated high school at 11 and had a Ph.D. in applied mathematics by 20.Child prodigies such as Mozart and Picasso are rare—most children can’t sustain that creative energy over their lifetimes and often suffer from burnout and other maladies. And though a child prodigy might be labeled a “creative genius,” people considered to be geniuses actually emerge as adults, after they’ve had time to gain a deep well of knowledge in the subject that they’re passionate about.While artists and musicians are often thought of as owning creativity, mathematicians and scientists who make their mark do so through creative invention of new methods and concepts. Therefore, anyone who rises to the level of genius, argues gifted-education researcher and psychologist Dona Matthews, must be a creative person.Basically, geniuses are adults who are capable of creativity—making new connections from across their knowledge base—at an extremely high level. They stand apart because they’re burning with ideas about how to tinker with their knowledge and make new things to an incomprehensible degree. Often that knowledge starts with a childhood obsession.How does genius develop, if not as an early precocity? There’s no single recipe, but experts agree that a few key ingredients are common: intelligence, creativity, and determination. Even more enlightening: High IQ doesn’t necessarily equate to genius. A study by Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman in the early 20th century found that high IQs did not predict creative success later in life. “Smart enough”—120 or so—is good enough, writes Iowa State University psychologist Nancy Andreasen.So your kid might not be a prodigy. By definition, your child also isn’t a genius—yet. But fostering your child’s creativity and supporting seemingly frivolous obsessions can have important long-term positive impacts on their personalities and passions. And it just might help your child develop their own personal genius.The way some brains are built may have something to do with how genius emerges.Research has shown that adults who are considered geniuses might have more neurons packed into certain areas of the brain, making their brains more efficient at processing certain kinds of information. Albert Einstein had more glial cells in some regions—these cells are responsible for the care and feeding of neurons—so certain parts of Einstein’s brain were better-fed, in a very real sense. Other studies have found increased cortical thickness and differing densities of gray and white matter in the brains of highly creative people.Though the science is still evolving, what scientists do know now is that creativity involves the entire brain—not the old chestnut of left- and right-brained abilities. Neuroimaging has shown that creative thinking engages a network of activity across the entire cortex in both hemispheres. Areas in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and the connective “white matter” tissues are all critical in creative processes.Genetics may also play a role. Personality traits that relate to creativity can be inherited from family, says Zach Hambrick, a cognitive neuroscientist who studies the genetics of expertise at Michigan State University. He says these traits include openness to ideas as well as the ability to pull from different areas of knowledge and put those ideas together to solve problems and adapt to different situations.Though this may be the case, Matthews, author of Beyond Intelligence, cautions against the view that individuals are born with exceptional creative ability, just as people aren’t born with knowledge that is often termed as “smarts.”“Most people who end up being ‘geniuses’ did not show up as anything exceptional as children,” she says. “It develops over time—people find their area of passion and follow it. Nobody is born a genius.”So if your child isn’t born a genius, how might they grow up to be one? Intelligent and relentlessly motivated, geniuses are extremely curious, open-minded, imaginative, and inventive; they’re also not afraid to take risks and make mistakes, says Claudia Kalb, author of Spark: How Genius Ignites, From Child Prodigies to Late Bloomers. Parents can encourage these traits, which will serve them well over their lifetimes no matter what.Early childhood is prime time for learning—and play is critical to learning. From birth until six years old, neural connections form at a rapid pace, from 2,500 synapses per neuron at birth to 15,000 per neuron by the time a child is two or three.Play allows “neural pathways to develop in a much more complex way,” Matthews says. That, she says, helps kids come up with ideas that draw upon their knowledge in a variety of subjects. “Developing those neural pathways makes you smarter.”Encouraging a child’s natural curiosity through play can help them connect with interests that might develop into a passion. For instance, creative play—with its openness and inventiveness—helps children develop their personalities and tastes, as well as understand the complicated world around them. It also helps develop “divergent thinking,” or the ability to brainstorm many possible solutions to a single problem.Creative problem-solving also develops confidence, says Stephen Chevalier-Putnam, director of the Meeting House Montessori School in Braintree, Massachusetts.“If, over time, kids have been allowed to take creative risks and found success, you get kids who are independent and confident,” he says. “Children who are willing to take creative risks are willing to try different things and approach problems differently.”Experts resoundingly echo one piece of advice for how to help children build creativity: Let the kids take the lead. This, Chevalier-Putnam says, helps empower them to figure out why something worked or didn’t, so the next time they’re faced with a similar situation, they can choose an appropriate approach.Here are some ideas to get started.Explore. Hambrick argues that finding a child’s obsession may be genetically influenced.  That’s why he recommends allowing kids to creatively explore a variety of interests and environments to find areas in which to excel. Though hard work certainly plays a role, children who are allowed to creatively explore are more likely to find their “niche,” where they can better leverage their genetic traits.Follow. In Spark, Kalb describes how Peter Mark Roget had a passion for words as a child but didn’t write his eponymous thesaurus until he was in his 70s. “Childhood passions can be really meaningful, and people can have really strong interests as kids that shouldn’t be disregarded as a mere hobby,” she says. “If they have a passion that strong, they’ll work hard at it.”Listen. Nurturing a child’s creativity can require a fine balance between pushing them to develop strengths you find interesting or useful, and what they’re personally interested in. Matthews says her number one rule is to listen carefully to build trust between you and your child. “Be sure not to impose your own interests,” she says. “Pay attention to your child’s curiosity and keep your own mind open to who the child is.”Play. “You wouldn’t look at Einstein developing theorems and say, ‘he’s playing,’ but there are big connections between creativity and play,” Matthews says. Navigating unpredictability, problem-solving in groups, and attempting challenges happens naturally during play.Rest. Repeat this mantra: It is 100 percent OK for a kid to be bored, awash in unstructured time without tablets or activities. “If an adult is constantly scheduling stuff for children, or telling them what’s happening next, when does the child have the opportunity to create their independent selves?” asks Chevalier-Putnam.Matthews says downtime often leads to a child coming up with an activity they enjoy so much that they become completely absorbed in it. “The concept of ‘flow’—that sense of timeless engagement in a task—is a really important dimension of creativity,” she says.Fail. In Spark, Kalb writes about how, as a child, Spanx founder Sarah Blakely received positive reactions from her father to flops and failures and attributes her resilience to her dad’s message of “if you fail, the worst has happened.”So resist the impulse to correct them or take over. “Kids will do things that look, most of the time, ugly or imperfect to us,” says Mathieu Penot, who helped create two hands-on creative learning platforms—Dowit and Lelu—for children. “But when parents come in to ‘help,’ the kid just won’t learn how to do it themselves. A bit of frustration is good.”Understand. Penot adds that it’s important to try to see a child’s creative endeavors through their eyes. So ask: Why did you draw something that way? Why did you cut that piece in that shape? “When you do that,” he says, “you’ll realize how much depth there is in a kid’s thinking that you’d never guess just by looking at what they’ve made.”",
"On a recent sunny December morning, a group of kindergartners from Mangrove School of Sarasota gathered on log benches in a Florida forest to eat lunch. They sat under a wooden hut with a thatched roof, a replica of early-1800s Native American housing that’s part of a local museum exhibit built by Miccosukee tribe members. They’d spent their morning having imaginary snowball fights and pretending to trick-or-treat among the spooky leafless trees.Their school, a private pre-K-8 school, normally held about 70 percent of instruction outside before the pandemic hit. But recently, the school shifted to being almost totally outdoors. “Parents say their kids come home happy and tired,” says Erin Melia, Mangrove’s director and 8th- and 9th- grade teacher.Based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics to use outdoor space as much as possible to help curb the spread of COVID-19, public and private schools across the United States are experimenting with outdoor education. Christy Merrick, director of the nonprofit Natural Start Alliance, which advocates for nature-based early childhood education, estimates that the number of outdoor school programs went from around 250 in 2017 to 600 in 2020.“We’ve learned you can create any space outdoors and turn it into a ‘classroom,’” says Olivia Santos, principal of the Solar Preparatory School for Girls, a public school in Dallas that’s been holding more classes outdoors since COVID hit.But it’s not just protection from COVID that kids are getting from outdoor school time. “For some reason, being outside increases their attention on the task they’re working on,” Santos says. “We notice that as they’re more interested, they’re better able to retain what they learn.” But even if kids don’t have access to schools doing outdoor education, parents can reap the benefits and foster extracurricular learning at home.Outdoor learning isn’t new, of course. The first forest school—where students spend most of their time outdoors— is thought to have started in Denmark in the early 1950s; they’ve been popular in Germany since the ’60s and more recently in the United Kingdom. Private Montessori and Waldorf schools usually incorporate plenty of outdoor time into their curriculum, too.Outdoor learning advocates says that learning in nature helps kids develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, resilience, an ability to work as a team, and an appreciation for nature. And a review of research from 2019 backs that up. Researchers in Denmark also concluded that learning in nature improves reading skills and increases motivation.Proponents see outdoor learning as not simply moving traditional lessons outside but rather a more holistic approach to the way children are educated.“We all learn by doing,” says Jeanne McCarty, CEO of Out Teach, a nonprofit that partners with schools to connect them with outdoor learning resources. “It’s not just teaching outdoors but using the outdoors to teach in real, hands-on ways. It makes education more relevant to students’ lives. When they experience something, it’s more meaningful to them.”The pandemic was a “catalyst for innovation,” says Ann Byrne, deputy director of Crossway Montessori Forest School in Kensington, Maryland, which recently pivoted to outdoor learning. They’re already seeing benefits.Because children have more elbow room, conflicts between them seemed to disappear, she says. Children labeled hyperactive are thriving outside, too. “All the physical activity requires large muscle work, which is calming to them,” Byrne says.Emma Howell, a pre-K teacher at Guilford Central School, says one of her most behaviorally challenging students has become a respected leader since her school’s switch to outdoor learning. Since the fall, students at the small public school in southeastern Vermont are outside at least half the day.“The outdoors is just a comfortable place for him. Outside, he comes up with all sorts of amazing ideas,” Howell says “The kids all follow his lead.”Fears that kids won’t learn important fundamentals in outdoor programs appear unfounded, says Marie Robinson, superintendent and elementary principal of Katahdin Schools in Stacyville, Maine, which have increased the amount of time students spend outdoors since the pandemic began.“Even with a shorter school day since the pandemic, we have seen academic gains that are not extremely different from any other school year,” she notes. “Immersing all of their senses is making a powerful difference in their learning.”For example, when students discovered a beaver lodge near the school, they learned new vocabulary terms and about scientific observation in addition to wildlife biology and ecology studying the animals and their dams.“The kids’ excitement and enthusiasm studying the beaver family propelled their learning,” she says.Being outdoors has helped kids’ mental health, too. “The global pandemic has evoked so many different feelings many of us haven't experienced before,” Robinson says, “Some of the things we know about the outdoors is that it reduces stress and improves well-being. That alone is a good enough reason to do it.”It definitely takes commitment to make outdoor learning work, especially in winter, Howell says.“It can be uncomfortable if it’s 39 degrees and raining or windy,” she says. “So we’ve worked on strategies for keeping fingers warm. I put a half-gallon of boiling water in a cooler in the morning so kids can put their mittens in there while they eat.”Another important step is to just get outside, Howell says. Don’t worry if kids aren't sure what to do with unstructured outdoor play at first, she advises. “It's not uncommon for kids to experience uncertainty and ‘boredom’ before they figure out how to engage.” Here are some ideas:Build a nature toolkit. Arming kids with old household items can help them dig into the natural world—literally. “Loose parts, such as old pots and pans, spoons, shovels, and rakes can help inspire creativity,” Howell says.Hunt for slugs. Holly Roger, co-founder of Wild Whatcom, a nonprofit advocating for outdoor education in Whatcom County in Washington State, suggests getting kids to poke around in damp environments to look for slugs and snails. Talk about what slugs like to eat, where they like to hang out, and observe how they move, she says. While you’re mucking around in the leaves, collect a few and make leaf rubbings back inside.Look for nests. It’s winter and all the leaves are off the deciduous trees, so it's a good time to play, ‘Count the Nests,’” Roger says. “To differentiate between squirrel dreys and bird nests, note that squirrels need protection to stay warm and dry, so look for ‘leaf blobs’ that are as tall as they are wide.”Hike and learn. Play games while on hikes to make them more motivating, Howell says. Hide treats on the trail for kids to find, play hide-and-seek along the way, or try “I Spy” to help with color or letter identification.Find “sit spots.” Howell’s students have special spots—like a tree, rock, or stump—that they can visit for a couple of minutes each day or a couple of times a week. “It’s fun to notice change over time and really get to know one special spot,” she says.Most important? Don’t give up.“Don’t get discouraged if kids say, ‘But I don't want to go outside!’” Howell says. “Persist, even if it's only for a few minutes to start. They'll soon find all sorts of wonderful things to explore, as long as they have the time and space to do so.”",
"Wendy Lamb’s daughter had taken on new cooking responsibilities since the stay-at-home orders began. As a result, the nine-year-old had become a smoothie-making master.Then the explosion happened. Partially blended frozen fruit ended up all over the kitchen counters and floor. “She always knows to make sure the top of the blender is in place,” says the West Hurley, New York, mom. “But I guess she didn’t double check the base of the blender this time.”Children are bored, and parents are busier than ever. No wonder kids are taking on more responsibilities in the kitchen and beyond. And according to Claire Lerner, a child development specialist based in Washington, D.C., it’s something that children often want—if parents will let them.“The major challenge of parenting is finding this balance between supporting and enabling,” she says, “So the question I'm always asking parents is, are you doing something for your child that they actually can do for themselves?”Though tying your kids’ shoes or making their lunches get the job done more quickly, Lerner says that letting children take control and develop new skills is especially important right now and can have long-lasting benefits.“When a child takes on new responsibilities, they get the sense that they are capable and confident,” Lerner says. “And that internal feeling is what leads them to get excited about taking on new things.”Giving children a little control when things feel so out of control can make them more independent. Often that can start with mundane chores. And though you might get some eyerolls when asking them to help you out more, Lerner advises showing them the positive benefits.“When kids help with chores, it saves time—that means more time for fun activities,” she says. “If they help set the table and clear dishes at mealtime, it means they have time for family movie night or to take a family walk in the dark with flashlights.”Candice Rivera, teacher and parent educator at Public School 89 in the Bronx, sees the effects of getting kids to do things they might normally not be expected to do. “Whether it's walking a dog or even washing dishes or cleaning the bathroom, it helps kids realize that that the world is bigger than them,” she says.That’s great … until the dishes break, the dog runs away, and the toilet overflows. But with a bit of advance work, letting kids figure out the best technique for folding their socks and then deciding where to store them develops problem-solving skills—and likely helps parents who need an extra set of hands.“The most positive, healthy parenting is knowing yourself,” Lerner says. So if your kid wants to be in charge of salads but a big mess in the kitchen is going to cause stress, break down the recipe into discrete tasks and have overarching guidelines—like “before we eat, we need to clean up”—that you feel comfortable with.Bigger projects that kids can be charge of—like maintaining a vegetable garden or creating a daily schedule—can also help them feel empowered. But make sure they’re tackling something within their limits, even if they’re just doing part of the project (like scheduling Mondays instead of the whole week).“We don't want to set the situation up for disaster, where something that should be super joyful now becomes fraught with anger,” Lerner says.So what happens when the veggies don’t grow or something’s left off the schedule? Don’t try to fix their mistakes—show kids it’s OK to own it.“It’s actually not great for kids for everything to always come out perfectly because that's just not the way life is,” Lerner says. “[The fact that] everything doesn't always come out the way you want it to is a critically important message.”Rivera agrees. “Learning happens through mistakes. It happens through communication and collaboration.”Lerner gives an example from one family she works with, who wanted to empower their 12-year-old daughter to plant a garden as a way to foster self-reliance and focus her days. But the girl picked out seeds that wouldn’t grow where she lived. That led to a conversation about responsibilities and limits. After researching the right type of seeds online, together the family came up with several options for her to choose from. Only then was able to take charge of the planting in a way that worked for everyone.If your kids are begging to be in charge of something (or complaining about how you do home tasks!) here are some fun ideas that can get them started on the road to self-reliance.Kids café. Let kids plan and cook a meal once a week. For a more restaurant-y feel, encourage them to create personalized limited-option menus. Younger kids can help with planning, setting the table, and cleaning up. (Get kid-friendly recipes.)Weekend warriors. Empower children to create the family’s Saturday schedule by suggesting restaurants to order from, board games to play, and movies to watch. (Get advice on taking back your weekend.)Nature walk. The next time you’re up for a family stroll, have the kids choose the route, then turn it into a weekly event. They can map it as they go, or plan it out beforehand. (Get tips for creating maps.)Plan a "stay-cation." Children complaining about never getting to go anywhere? Let them plan a virtual trip. Paris anyone? Have them choose snacks (baguettes and cheese!), movies (Ratatouille is a classic), and other location-based activities (eating like you’re at an outdoor café). They can even teach parents a few words or songs inspired by their choice. (Research locations at Nat Geo Kids.)Grow a garden. Set your family up for success by researching plants that grow best in your region. Choose veggies your kids like to eat and flowers you'd like to display. (Find out how gardening can teach life skills.)Family historian. Instill this title on your kids and have them document your pandemic life. Let them use an old camera or cell phone to interview family members about their lives right now, then put it all together as a movie or scrapbook. (Here’s how to engage children with family stories.)Make them entertainment directors. Let the kids be the boss of the after-dinner entertainment. They can plan out a new activity each night, whether it’s a family talent show or a themed movie night.",
"Weekends used to have a rhythm that worked for Ezina LeBlanc, filled with adventures for her 19-month-old twins in Calabasas, California. “Every Saturday, we’d be off to the beach, hiking, a picnic, a museum, a theme park, or even up to Mammoth Lakes to ski,” she recalls.Shermikia Lemon had a similar routine. The Greensboro, North Carolina, mom shut down her computer on Fridays and dedicated weekends to shopping, seeing movies, and picnicking with her husband and two daughters.Then, the pandemic hit.The first Saturday she was stuck home, LeBlanc found herself playing “Ring Around the Rosie” and dancing to “Baby Shark” for hours. Lemon turned to work to fill the weekends. “I was treating every day the same,” she says. “I would wake up, get coffee, and head straight to the computer, even on Saturdays and Sundays.”In the “before times,” weekdays were for school and work; weekends werefor taking a break. But COVID-19 forced families to stay in one place day after day, making every day feel like the next. Soon it felt like the pandemic has stolen weekends from many families, just when they needed them most.“To be more productive and spend a good working week, you absolutely need some time to rest, or do something that gives you energy,” professional organizer Paola Tursi says.Though the structure we once knew has been altered, she says we can reclaim our weekends with a loose plan: Divide both Saturday and Sunday into morning, afternoon, and evening. Write down ideas for fun throughout the week, then fill in those time blocks pulling from your list.“The weekend is a chance for a real break, and that can still happen during the pandemic,” Tursi says. “It's about choosing and setting your priorities and respecting them.”Lazy weekend mornings are nothing new. But before the pandemic, you could follow them with a rush out the door to someplace exciting. Now, they might unintentionally stretch on all day.One way to prevent that: Start off high-energy and keep it up from there. “We turn on Alexa to KidzBop, and my hubby and I start a dance party with the kids,” LeBlanc says.Slower mornings can be easier to control if you plan an end time. Chris Reavis and his 11-year-old son like to play board games, or sometimes his son will draw, write, or work on a puzzle. But once lunchtime is over, the West Linn, Oregon, dad makes sure everyone gets more active.And if you want a day that’s lazy from start to finish? That’s fine too. Just be sure it’s a choice.“If you all of a sudden realize that it's evening, you still haven’t showered, and you have no idea how you spent your day, you’re probably going to regret it,” Tursi says. “It’s all about making a decision and acting the way you decided.”With most traditional weekend activities now extremely limited or completely shuttered, parents are often left with empty afternoon hours. But filling them with activities that set weekends apart can be a challenge when everything—work, school, socializing, personal time—happens at home.“We sort of lost our ‘safe space,’ that privacy at home, and we have nowhere else to go,” Tursi says. “That’s why we need to create new circumstances.”Sometimes that means replacing old traditions with new ones. Before the pandemic, Reavis and his son had a regular weekend routine of lunch at a favorite burrito spot, followed by tennis practice and matches. Now, they hike. “We discovered a different park in the forest near us with bridges and great places to explore,” Reavis says. “He’s as excited about this as he was a new Marvel movie.”Other families are turning old, infrequent activities into regular weekend events. For instance, before she was working from home, Lemon and her family would occasionally have picnics on a lake during the weekend. Now she makes those an almost-every-weekend happening to keep away from her laptop. (Check out easy picnic recipes the kids can help prepare.)For Kathy Heffernan of Lynn, Massachusetts, a change of scenery away from home is especially important after a hectic week juggling work and parenting her five-year-old son. So they’ll usually head outside for a nature scavenger hunt or another activity—no matter what the weather. “If it’s rainy we put on our rain boots, take the umbrella out, and stomp in the puddles all the way to a local pond,” she says. (Get printable neighborhood bingo cards.)Special meals, staying up late … that’s what weekends are all about. That goes double during the pandemic. But a traditional weekend treat only delivers if it’s designed that way.Kerry Wekelo of Reston, Virginia, now themes Sunday dinners with her 12- and 14-year-old to make meals special. A recent French night featured a recipe for crepes that came from her grandmother.“I wanted weekends to be entertaining and involved versus humdrum,” she says.At the beginning of their isolation, Elaine Harrison let her 14-year-old stay up late every night. But when the mom from Devon, England, limited that to Friday and Saturday nights, weekends were suddenly special. Other weekend-night-only activities to consider include dance parties in which every family member creates a 20-minute playlist or a movie night with themed snacks. (Homemade ice pops during Frozen 2, anyone?)The ideal weekend? Ending it with the knowledge that you took a break and used your time wisely. According to Tursi, it’s a feeling parents can take with them even after the pandemic ends.“It's about having a rhythm that replaces working days with resting days,” Tursi says. “Hopefully COVID-19 has taught us to choose what really matters to us and how we want to spend our time.”",
"A few years ago, I stunned a young student in one of my gardening classes after telling him that he couldn’t actually grow pickles—only cucumbers. From that moment he craved to learn more.Whether your garden is on a city windowsill or in a big backyard, getting kids involved in tending plants can be a powerful teaching tool for subjects like science, math, and reading. But the art of growing stuff can also promote important life skills in children. Here’s how your garden can grow responsibility, kindness, and other values in your kids.Why your kid needs it: Being patient is something many children struggle with, but it can be an important factor in future school success. It also helps a kid stay calm in stressful situations, which promotes good mental health. “To most children, everything is in the moment,” says psychiatrist David Scott May of Mill Valley, California. “Life is a blend of immediate and delayed gratification, so children benefit from learning about both.”How a garden helps: Good stuff comes at the end of a growing season—like yummy fruit or pretty flowers—but kids have to wait for it. For instance, a carrot seed can take between 70 and 80 days to mature.How to grow it: Ease them into their new patient attitude with quick-to-sprout options like sunflowers and nasturtiums that germinate in about seven to 10 days; arugula can be ready to eat in five to seven days. For longer-growth plants, kids can create a garden journal to document the progress of their seedling with words, drawings, or photos.Why your kid needs it: Research shows that practicing mindfulness is a great stress reliever, even for children. “When kids realize that what’s happening ‘in the moment’ is personally affecting them, they become more self-aware,” says child therapist Jennifer Couture of Kentfield, California. “That helps strengthen qualities like empathy, kindness, appreciation, and generosity.”How a garden helps: Working in a garden engages children with multiple sounds, smells, and sights. Activities that encourage kids to focus on all these at once can bring calm to their young minds. When kids are aware of what they’re thinking and noticing, “they realize they have the power to control their big feelings and thoughts,” Couture says.How to grow it: Encourage kids to zone out while they’re doing a rote task such as watering or digging. (Bonus if you can get them to do it without headphones!) Engaging with multiple sensory experiences—the feel and smell of dirt, the sound and sight of water—helps them to focus on the moment, bringing them a sense of calm.Why your kid needs it: Studies suggest that children who are considered helpful go on to make better grades and achieve career success. And of course, kindness can help kids develop empathy—both toward others and themselves. “Being kind helps children develop positive relationships,” says psychologist Christine Curtin of Mill Valley, California. “It can also help them manage feelings of anxiety and depression.”How a garden helps: When kids realize that a garden is full of living things that need their help to survive, they can develop a sense of caring and thoughtfulness.How to grow it: Think about kind options to maintain a healthy garden, such as having kids plant garden helpers like thyme and tansy, which both have strong oils that deter pesky bugs like aphids and whiteflies. You can also help them release beneficial ladybugs to devour aphids on plants like roses.Why your kid needs it: Children who see themselves as more responsible often feel empowered and confident. And learning to take responsibility for their choices teaches kids how to choose between right and wrong. “Teaching responsibility helps kids develop critical-thinking skills,” says child and adolescent psychiatrist Tracy Asamoah of Austin, Texas. “Plus, they learn how to contribute to the greater good.”How a garden helps: Maintaining any kind of garden—even a small window box—needs constant, long-term commitment and follow-through to make sure the plants thrive.How to grow it: Put kids in charge of a single container or a small part of a bigger garden for which they’re totally responsible. Try theming the child’s area of the garden: for instance, one with herbs and vegetables you’ll use to make pizza.Why your kid needs it: Kids with positive self-esteem are more likely to try new things and overcome mistakes. “They’re more likely to reach for their goals despite setbacks,” says psychotherapist Laurie Javier of San Rafael, California. “They’re also more respectful of themselves and others.”How a garden helps: Gardening brings children a sense of accomplishment after they’ve watched their plants go from seedling to food or flowers. And observing how one plant flourishes while another one doesn’t helps children learn from harmless mistakes.How to grow it: To provide a boost of confidence, choose activities that provide a quick result of their hard work, such as weeding or pruning flowers. Another idea is to have them plant and care for a small tree, like a dwarf lemon, that will remind them of their achievement for a long time.",
"When 12-year-old Sami Grover told his grandmother he was adapting a vegetarian lifestyle, she cried.Grover, now an environmentalist and the author of the forthcoming book We're All Climate Hypocrites Now, says his Finnish grandmother was distraught at the idea of not being able to prepare his favorite stews any longer.“I think for a lot of us, cooking is a way of showing love,” says Grover, who as an adult still eats a heavily plant-based diet but is less all-or-nothing than he was as a kid. “It’s also a way of connecting to traditions and heritage.”That fear of losing a familial connection at the dinner table is just one of the reasons that carnivorous parents may freak out when their child announces they’re vegetarian (no meat) or vegan (no meat or animal products). And though currently only about 2 percent of vegetarians in the United States are children, that might be changing. As kids continue to champion causes that fight against climate change and animal mistreatment—and as they watch trendy restaurants and foodie magazines do the same—experts are seeing more youngsters embracing a plant-based diet.“It’s more prevalent to see families choose to follow a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle with their children these days than in the past,” says registered dietitian Karla Moreno-Bryce, who is herself vegan and raising a vegan daughter.And though kids’ interest in going vegetarian hasn’t been widely studied, Natalie Muth, a pediatrician, registered dietitian, and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, says that anecdotally, she’s also seen an increase of children more interested in a meat-free diet, often spurred by concerns about environmental impact and animal cruelty.“Vegetarianism is becoming increasingly common on the whole,” Muth says. “While in the past there was concern that a vegetarian diet might be ‘inadequate’ in certain key nutrients, that’s generally not the case in well planned vegetarian diets.”Even if you’re a bit wary about your child’s new dietary interest, experts agree that respecting their choice with unemotional discussions and thoughtful solutions will go a long way toward ensuring they stay happy and healthy. Here’s how to start the conversation.Concern about climate change was a key reason that Muth’s 10-year-old, bacon-loving daughter recently announced that she wanted to stop eating meat altogether. In fact, meat production can have huge impacts on the environment—from greenhouse gas emissions to water usage, fertilizer pollution to biodiversity loss from land-clearing. Based on calculations from one 2019 report, if everyone in the U.S. went vegetarian, we’d decrease greenhouse emissions by 5 percent.That’s not likely to happen, and kids skipping their burgers won’t unilaterally solve climate change. But Grover notes that protecting the planet through food choices doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing decision.“You can get a large amount of the climate benefits just by cutting out beef or cutting back significantly on the beef you eat,” he says, adding that because chicken, pork, and seafood impact the environment less, kids don’t have to throw out all non-plant protein sources to make a difference.And it should come as no surprise that eating less meat—especially red meat—is a healthier diet choice.“Children and adolescents who follow a vegetarian eating plan tend to consume greater amounts of fruits and vegetables and less sweets, salty snacks, and saturated fat than their non-vegetarian peers,” Muth says. “They also tend to be at lower risk for being overweight and obese.”Moreno-Bryce adds that kids who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet have a lower risk of developing certain chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The key, of course, is making sure that children still receive the nutrients they need—and that often means some extra effort from parents. (For example, inadequate iron intake, which is common in most children, can be even more prevalent in kids on a vegetarian eating plan.) According to the Academy for Nutrition and Dietetics, children can thrive while following a plant-based diet, as long as it includes a variety of nutritional sources including legumes, grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.Lianne Phillipson, Registered Nutritionist and host of the Eat This With Lianne podcast, recommends food choices like sesame seeds and leafy greens for calcium; egg yolks for vitamin D; nutritional yeast, tempeh, or nori seaweed for B12; pumpkin seeds for zinc; and walnuts and Brazil nuts for omega-3 fatty acids.“A well-planned vegetarian eating plan can provide optimal nutrition and health benefits,” Muth says. That said, consult your pediatrician before pursuing any long-lasting dietary change. Children may have particular needs or underlying conditions to consider when crafting an eating plan that supports their growth. A medical professional might also want to do baseline tests like blood work to monitor your child’s progress and can also watch out for psychological issues. (A drastic change in diet can mask an eating disorder.)To a family of meat-eaters, a child coming home and announcing he or she is now vegetarian can be a bit of a shock. But congratulations: The fact that your child has told you about their decision is important.“It means they trust their parents to seek the proper support and guidance,” Moreno-Bryce says. “Having frequent discussions about this choice will help [you] come up with a plan on how to best transition, together.”Registered dietitian Pegah Jalali adds that it’s a good idea for parents to understand what—or who—is motivating the child (it’s not always about animal rights!) and where they’re getting their information. “It’s like drugs, sex, alcohol: You don’t want them to learn about it outside of your house, because then they’re going to go to any source to try to get information,” she says. “If the conversation is welcoming and you’re offering a safe place for them to talk, then it’s always going to have a better outcome.”Phillipson suggests asking questions that encourage further information sharing. (Can you tell me more about your decision? How did you decide this? Is there a recipe you’d like to try?) But strive to avoid judgment—and perhaps your own personal opinion.“Parents need to keep their ears open and their mouths closed to start, and allow their child to explain their decision to them,” Phillipson says. “It could be really hard, but that’s part of honoring their choice. If [children] feel supported in what they’re doing, they’re going to be far more open to a discussion around it.”Even as you support your child’s decision, it’s good to make sure they understand how it might affect their life—and to help find solutions. For instance, what will they do at birthday cookouts? How will they make sure their little brother still gets to eat his beloved chicken nuggets? How will this decision affect the person who prepares the meals?“It’s a big decision for the individual, but it’s also a big decision for the family,” Phillipson says. “So everyone needs to get onboard.”Even if you’re not 100 percent behind your kid’s new veggie lifestyle, small, gradual gestures can show that the whole family is onboard, which helps the child feel supported. Here are some ideas:• Find plant-based recipes to share with your kid to see what sounds good.• Make family events—like movie night or a weekend picnic—inclusive of your child’s vegetarian diet.• Get your child involved in making meals. This will help children take ownership of their decision—and let them decide if the desire matches the effort.• Try “sequential cooking,” in which you take out the non-meat portion of a meal just before adding meat for the rest of the family (for instance, removing the spaghetti before adding the meatballs).• Plan international meal nights and lean into cuisines already high in vegetarian ingredients, such as Indian vegetable curries or Mediterranean dishes with tahini (high in calcium!) or falafel.• Compromise! Swap out one meal a week for a meatless option (try plant-based burgers instead of beef ones, or replace meat with lentils in a well-loved dish), or think about going meatless on the weekends. Other ideas: Cut back on red meat but not, say, chicken; or try out “pescatarianism,” in which you eat fish instead of meat.Heather Greenwood Davis is a National Geographic contributing editor.

"Pele used to have a regular routine that got him out of the house. The nine-year-old from Bedford, Massachusetts, played sports, ran around with friends, and enjoyed daily recess at school. But with COVID-19 still raging, he’s now mostly cooped up at home—and winter is coming.Even before the pandemic, children were spending only about four to seven minutes a day in unstructured outdoor play, according to the National Recreation and Park Association. That time has been slashed now that most outside activities are limited—many children aren’t even getting fresh air going to and from school. In fact, a recent study by the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine found that parents reported their children were less physically active and more sedentary during April and May compared to February.And now, here come shorter days and chilly weather—something that’s bound to make children want to snuggle indoors more. But scientists agree that getting outside even during colder months is crucial for a child’s health.Parents likely know sunlight’s healthy effects: It helps produce bone-building vitamin D and stimulates a gland that regulates mood and sleep. But outdoor activity also releases feel-good hormones called endorphins, which can help calm people and relieve anxiety. That’s especially important now, since many experts believe that the pandemic is contributing to an increase in anxiety and depression among children, says Forrest Talley, a clinical psychologist with Invictus Psychological Services in Folsom, California.“Some of the biggest benefits of going outdoors are cognitive and social,” he explains. “When kids play with other kids, they get a sense of community, which almost invariably diminishes depression.” (Make sure to follow local pandemic protocols and CDC guidelines for outdoor playdates.)The trick, of course, is convincing your kids to bundle up and leave the warm embrace of your home. Here are some ideas on how to get them to chill out.If your children are literally digging in their heels as you try to push them out the front door, take a step back.“If you know your kids will resist, be proactive,” says parenting consultant Laura Froyen of Madison, Wisconsin, whose daughters are 5 and 8. “Have a conversation during a calm, connected moment, while having a snack or playing quietly.”Ask your child what’s getting in the way of being outside. Then dig deeper. Ask what they want to do and where they want to go. If you’re in a bubble with friends, find out who they want to see. Those questions can help you brainstorm.For instance, Froyen once worked with a mother who couldn’t figure out why her 10-year-old son disliked the dog park. After having a conversation with him, she discovered that he was upset he couldn’t join the friends he saw there because they weren’t in his COVID-19 bubble. Once his mother understood, she stopped pushing the park and planned outdoor activities elsewhere.Pele’s mom, Bridget Barrett-Parker, says the biggest barrier to getting him and his two-year-old sister out in winter isn’t their resistance—it’s often her own. Having a reason to get outside helps.“That makes it something to look forward to,” says Barrett-Parker, a teacher and parenting consultant. “If there’s a convenience store within walking distance or a spot in the garden to observe, I can say, ‘Let’s make a trip out of it.’”Another way to overcome resistance: Make going outside part of your daily routine.“Make it non-negotiable,” Barrett-Parker says. “Whether you take a walk before or after school each morning, spend time at the park, or make a plan to meet up with a friend, setting a consistent time to be outside every day takes the pressure off of you.”And as much as you might want to, don’t ignore the “I’m bored” or “I’m cold” complaints. Acknowledge them, but then help kids build up to regular, long-term activity.“Even if you only manage to get your kids outside for five minutes one day, six the next, that’s a win,” Froyen says. “Aim for progress over perfection.”Do your kids have a favorite indoor activity? Take it outside—with a twist.Fill spray bottles with cold water and food coloring for snow painting, recommends parent coach L. Elizabeth Forry of Annapolis, Maryland. “What’s better than an undisturbed and pure white canvas?” says the mom of boys ages six and nine.Jolene Caufield, mom to a six-year-old in Baltimore, suggests an outdoor slumber party. Separate tents can ensure social distancing. “Make sure they don't have any gadgets on them so they can really enjoy it,” she adds.Blending seasonal activities can also make going out in the cold more appealing. Sarah Miller, mom of a five- and two-year-old in Kalamazoo, Michigan, notes some summer activities can be even more fun in winter.“Toy trucks or sand toys from the beach get a new life as snow toys,” she says. “Kids can blow bubbles and see if they’ll freeze.”If traditional winter activities are more your style, try ramping up the excitement to entice kids outdoors.“Don’t just go sledding—go night sledding,” suggests Jessica Speer, mom to a 12- and 14-year-old in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. “Don't just watch the sunset from your yard—find a special lookout after a hike to a new place.”Graeme Esarey, dad to a 12- and 14-year-old in Bainbridge Island, Washington, has plans for storm watching on the beach and winter river rafting. But he notes even low-key activities, like playing chess or drinking hot chocolate, are more fun if you take them outdoors. (Just remember to keep it cozy with the right gear, like a heated blanket.)“The idea of having an adventure is really important to kids,” he says. “Get them mentally ready, and take every opportunity to create one.”",
"Anna Dopheide has plenty of activities to keep her five-year-old son's brain fit when he's stuck inside. But his body? That's a different challenge entirely.“Somehow, everything active we try turns into backbreaking work,” says the mom from Studio City, California. “Putting the trampoline in the living room means pushing heavy furniture out of the way. A kid yoga video means my husband and I are doing kid yoga, too!”Whether you're trying to avoid risks related to COVID-19 or protecting children from extreme weather, keeping kids active these days might seem impossible. But it’s important. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, exercise can help kids improve recall, concentration, and grades—crucial things as many schools transition to digital classrooms.In addition to promoting brain health, staying active is important for mental health. “Physical activity is a key component of emotional resilience and well-being,” says Hector de Leon, a Fort Collins, Colorado, pediatrician and assistant regional medical director of pediatrics for Kaiser Permanente in Colorado. “That’s why we need to prioritize physical activity as a family during this historic public health crisis.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get at least an hour of activity a day, incorporating exercise that promotes heart-pumping activity, muscle building, and bone strengthening. But fitting that into a kid’s home routine can feel daunting. Luckily we’ve got ideas from the experts on how to keep your kids moving.Pump it upBesides simply keeping children at a healthy weight, the HHS says getting heart rates up can help kids sleep better, ease anxiety, and decrease the risk of chronic illness later. To do that, the it recommends that kids should get “moderate-intensity aerobic activity” daily. Just think: fast fun.De Leon, who has a 19-month-old and a three-and-a-half-year-old, uses music from his childhood to play quick games of Musical Chairs, Simon Says, Follow the Leader, and Freeze Dance. “I grew up along the border with Mexico, so I’ve been having fun with some ethnic diversity,” he says. To really speed things up, de Leon created a racetrack that his kids use to physically race cars, balls, or each other. Don’t have toy tracks? Try masking tape.Physical therapist Karen Wartan of Glendale, California, says her 10- and 12-year-old enjoy tossing a balloon and keeping it from touching the ground, getting everyone laughing and moving. “And it’s something they can do while I’m still in bed,” she says.You can even get creative with scavenger hunts. “On a blank sheet of paper, write the ABC’s,” says Meredith Pharis, a clinical social worker and mom of a two-year-old in Westchester County, New York. “Randomly stick them around the house and have the kids race around to find them,” she says. “For older kids, you can use words.”And there’s always healthy housework. “Picking up laundry, sweeping floors, and unloading the laundry all get your heart rate up,” says Ruth Stefanos, a pediatrician who works with the Johns Hopkins Ruth and Norman Rales Center for the Integration of Health and Education, a school health program in Baltimore. Rather than assigning jobs, Stefanos suggests having the whole family pitch in. “This can become a chance to reengage together,” she says. Plus it takes care of one more to-do.Build up bonesBuilding up bone strength is especially important during childhood. Bone tissue protects organs and prevents fractures, but, according to the National Institutes of Health, it pretty much stops collecting in a body by the time a girl is 18 or a boy is 20. Luckily you can turn almost any game into a bone strengthener by adding jumping, skipping, or hopping. For loud fun, think bubble wrap. “Jumping on it is great,” Wartan says.Another favorite is the Cotton Ball Race. “You hold a spoon with cotton on it and move across the room,” Wartan says. By adding couch cushions and pillows as obstacles to jump or hop over, kids work their whole bodies.Hopscotch is one more way to jump around. “You can use painter’s tape for the lines,” Pharis says. And how about indoor basketball? “We pass a small ball into a trash can,” Wartan says. “You can make it harder by picking up the ball from the floor each time.” That squat-to-stand motion can build bones.To make things more fun while kids are building those bones, Lenny Parracino recommends practicing basketball like a pro athlete might: blindfolded. (He should know: He’s a manual / movement therapist for the Los Angeles Clippers.) “Playing blindfolded also works on your depth perception,” says Parracino, who’s also on the faculty at the Gray Institute, which operates the nonprofit Free2Play that helps get kids active. “And it’s so much fun.”Make those musclesBuilding muscle mass helps kids avoid injury, stay strong, and maintain a healthy weight. It’s even been shown to boost self-esteem. But most kids shouldn’t use free weights—their own body weight is enough to build muscle. “Kids need to first learn to control their body weight before adding artificial loads,” Parracino says.The dad of two teens favors quick, weight-free exercise breaks throughout the day. “We call them ‘movement snacks,’” he says. “It’s getting up after 15 to 20 minutes on the computer and just moving.”How kids move makes it fun: Each child picks a movement plus a way to make it a little wacky. “So a brother and sister can run while holding hands and facing each other—without pushing or pulling each other over,” Parracino says. Resistance builds muscles, so that natural push-and-pull helps do the job.Parracino remembers one boy at Free2Play picking muscle-building push-ups for his movement, then adding a caterpillar-like worm move. (Think back to your break-dancing days.) “Soon all the kids were doing The Worm,” he says.Making things more challenging—but in a fun way—can help inspire kids to keep exercising and building muscle, especially if family members choose challenges for each other. Try balancing on one foot while turning in place, doing jumping jacks with your arms crossed over your chest (which builds bones and muscles!), or crab walking while blindfolded. Doing familiar resistance exercises—like squats, lunges, or leg raises—backward, upside-down, in different directions, or with a twist can keep the fun going.“The key is to be fun, creative, and variable,” Parracino says.And though keeping kids fit helps maintain good health, exercising together can do so much more. “These kinds of activities also help bring families together,” de Leon says. “You might realize that gosh, you don’t need a whole lot more than this, and that we’re going to be OK.”",
"When a rabid fox made a surprise appearance at the U.S. Capitol in April, the great outdoors suddenly seemed a little less great. The fox bit at least nine people before it was captured, reminding everyone that encountering wildlife always comes with a bit of caution.Fortunately, rabies isn’t a common danger—only one to three human cases are reported annually in the U.S. And the benefits of being outdoors far outweigh the risks, especially for kids. According to the Child Mind Institute, playing outdoors can build confidence, improve focus, reduce anxiety, and promote happier moods."When we think about kids and especially their mood, we know that a sense of building mastery over a skill or their environment is powerful in terms of keeping mood higher,” says Heather Bernstein, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute. “You can’t control how fast the wind is blowing or how fast the stream is moving.” By adapting to their outdoor environment or overcoming a challenge, kids can build that sense of mastery.Still, what makes “the wild” into a great learning lab also makes it potentially hazardous. And though rabid animals and murder hornets might grab headlines—and panic parents—other threats are much more likely. “That's why we emphasize planning ahead,” says National Park Service spokesperson and 15-year ranger Kathy Kupper.The key is to arm kids with enough knowledge and know-how to explore independently while staying safe. Here’s what kids need to know to be confident outdoors, so they can build both skills and memories.What they could encounter: a rabid animal. Although contracting rabies is rare, kids should alert an adult if they see an animal acting sick or strange: for instance, a normally shy animal trying to bite, or a critter snapping at the air, drooling, or having trouble moving. Animals to be especially aware of are bats, foxes, raccoons, and skunks.What they'll more likely encounter: a cute animal they want to approach. Seeing a wild animal in person can be incredibly exciting for kids. But startled animals can charge, protective mamas can attack, and human-fed critters can lose their wariness of people—or even get sick.What kids should do: “Not all animals with rabies are aggressive or drooling,” Kupper says. “So the rule of thumb is to keep your distance from any wildlife.” About two school bus lengths is a good amount for kids to keep between them and any wild animal they encounter.That includes cute squirrels. “The number one reason for visits to the clinic at Grand Canyon is squirrel bites,” Kupper says. “An easy tip to remember is, ‘If I'm close enough to take a selfie, I'm too close.’”Other tips from Kupper: “Store and dispose of food properly to avoid attracting wildlife, stay on marked trails, and watch where you step.”What they could encounter: a venomous snake. “Very few people are at risk of encountering a snake with enough venom to do serious harm,” Kupper says. But teaching kids what to be on the lookout for is key.Three venomous snakes in the U.S.—copperheads, rattlesnakes, and cottonmouths (also called water moccasins)—have broad, diamond-shaped heads and catlike pupils. The fourth, the coral snake, has a black snout and red and yellow stripes that touch each other. The coral snake also has a helpful rhyme: “Red touch yellow, kill a fellow,” while the nonvenomous, similarly striped king snake’s rhyme is “Red touch black, friend of Jack.”What they'll more likely encounter: a nonvenomous snake that doesn't want to be disturbed. “In general, snakes are usually harmless,” Kupper says. But if they’re threatened or provoked, even nonvenomous snakes can strike very quickly with a painful bite. “Most bites happen when someone tries to touch or move a snake, and they’re much faster and can strike much further than people think they can,” she adds.What kids should do: Teach kids that snakes like to hide—key spots include leaves, tall grass, fallen logs, and rodent burrows. So children should be extra careful around those places when exploring, and wear closed-toe shoes just in case.Cold-blooded snakes might also be sunning themselves on trails or rocks to keep warm. Children might be inclined to throw rocks or poke at those reptiles, but experts advise to leave them alone and back away slowly. And because it’s really hard to tell the difference between venomous and nonvenomous slitherers without getting dangerously close, the smartest move is for kids to stay away from any snake.What they could encounter: murder hornets. These sound scary, but take heart: Even though two-inch-long “murder hornets” (officially known as Asian giant hornets) have more toxic stings than other wasps, these insects have been spotted only a handful of times in the U.S. and CanadaWhat they'll more likely encounter: regular bees or waspsWhat kids should do: Rule number one is to play it cool. “Most bees and hornets are focused on gathering food," Kupper says. “They’re just trying to protect themselves, their food source, and their hive.”Train kids to listen for a lot of buzzing that might indicate a nearby hive. Whether they encounter a single buzzer or a swarm, kids should cover their faces, walk away, and don't swat, which can agitate the insects. (Kupper also suggests that kids out in the woods wear long-sleeved clothing.)What they could encounter: giant hogweed. Looking like a Godzilla-size bouquet, giant hogweed has made the news recently because its sprays of white flowers can release skin-burning sap. But the chances of a kid bumping into it are slim in most states.What they'll more likely encounter: poison oak, poison sumac, or poison ivyWhat kids should do: The best advice is to tell kids to avoid touching any plant unless they know what it is. But that’s not likely going to happen. Instead, teach kids to recognize what these plants look like so they can stay away from them while outside.Poison ivy can be recognized by the old rhyme “Leaves of three, let it be,” and it sometimes has green or white berries. Poison oak usually has leaves that grow in threes, but not always. Its leaves are lobed like real oak leaves (though it's not related), and has clusters of greenish or white berries.Poison sumac—which can cause the same burns and blisters that poison ivy and oak does—can be recognized by its bright red stems; smooth-edged fall leaves that turn bright red, orange, or yellow; and tiny green or whitish berries.If kids do touch a poisonous plant, Kupper urges them to wash their hands and clothes as soon as possible.",
"Asian giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia) will aggressively defend their colonies, though when they are out foraging they tend to ignore people.How does it feel to be stung by an Asian giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia? It hurts. A lot.The sensation is like being “stabbed by a red-hot needle,” says Shunichi Makino, who studies wasps and bees at Japan’s Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute. Not only that, but the anguish lingers.“Usually, the stung part severely swells and continues aching for a few days,” Makino explains, via email. And “although you could also have these symptoms when stung by the other hornet species, the intensity is said to be much more severe in Vespa mandarinia.”Soichi Yamane got stung on the job. He was a wasp researcher—now retired—and he confirms Makino’s description: “The pain lasted two days, and my sleep was often disturbed by severe pain.”Stories of agonizing stings are one reason why the recent discovery of two giant hornets in Washington State has created such a sensation. The insects are now trending on social media as “murder hornets.”Though the insects have the potential to spread, to date they haven’t been found anywhere else in the United States. And scientists and other specialists are hard at work trying to locate and eliminate any hidden populations in the area of concern in northwest Washington.The fascination with these insects and the danger they pose raises the question: What, if anything, is special about the sting of an Asian giant hornet? And just how toxic is its venom?Asian giant hornets have long stingers capable of piercing the protective gear normally worn by beekeepers.The toxicity of venom from the Asian giant hornet, and from a handful of its close relatives, is considerable. It’s greater than the toxicity of most other stinging insects, says Justin Schmidt, who has studied the hornets.An entomologist at the University of Arizona’s Southwestern Biological Institute, Schmidt is an expert in venom. He developed a well-known scale of sting painfulness, known as the Schmidt pain index.In a 1986 paper co-authored by Schmidt, Yamane, and others, the researchers took venom from various species of giant hornet and injected it into lab mice, a standard experiment at the time for testing a substance's toxicology.Researchers determine toxicity using a measure called the LD50. Also known as the median lethal dose, it's the quantity necessary to kill 50 percent of test subjects, usually small animals like mice. In their 1980s research, the scientists found that giant hornet venom has an LD50 of 4.1 milligrams per kilogram—a level similar to other closely related hornets. The less venom required for a lethal dose, the more dangerous the substance.For comparison’s sake, the LD50 of honeybee venom is 2.8 mg/kg. And the world’s most toxic insect venom belongs to the Maricopa harvester ant, with an LD50 value of about 0.1 mg/kg in mice.Though honeybees have venom that’s more toxic than giant hornets, the bees can sting only once. Giant hornets can sting repeatedly, and are capable of delivering about 10 times more venom. The scientists determined that the venom in one giant hornet would be capable of killing about 10 mice—and that a small colony could kill a 150-pound animal.It makes sense that the species carries a lot of venom, as it is the world’s largest hornet at more than 1.5 inches long. But even they are not the most militant in defending their nests: Yellow hornets (Vespa simillima) native to Japan may actually be more dangerous given their aggressive behavior yet smaller size, says Seiki Yamane, Soichi’s brother, who also studies wasps, at Kagoshima University Museum.What makes the sting of the Asian giant hornet so painful? Schmidt says that acetylcholine and histamine within the venom cause pain and swelling, assisted by chemicals called kinins that dilate blood vessels. A substance called mastoparan, not found in bee venom, and phospholipase synergistically act to degrade immune cells and spur widespread inflammation. In combination with kinins, these chemicals can break down blood and muscle cells, Schmidt says.This destruction leads to the release of large molecules like hemoglobin, which the kidney must filter out. But several of the chemicals within the venom are toxic to the kidneys as well—one reason why giant hornet attacks can lead to renal failure, Schmidt says. The species also has a unique neurotoxin that can block nerve impulses.“It’s a nasty cocktail of chemicals designed so that you don’t mess with these guys again,” Schmidt says.For the venom to reach life-threatening levels, a person likely would have to be stung by a couple hundred giant hornets, Schmidt says, compared with about a thousand honeybees.In Japan, giant hornets cause between 30 to 50 deaths per year, but most of the fatalities are due to allergic anaphylactic reactions rather than acute toxicity, Schmidt says.It’s important to remember, however, that giant hornets, like other wasps, generally will not attack unless bothered. Especially when the insects are out foraging, they are likely to ignore humans; most deaths from giant hornets’ stings occur because people seriously disturb the insects' nests.Schmidt observes that giant hornets do give a warning before they sting: They fly back and forth snapping their mandibles. “That is intimidating, that gets your attention,” Schmidt says. “It’s the only species that does that.”Schmidt himself has never been stung by an Asian giant hornet, even though he began working with them in 1980. His Japanese colleagues advised Schmidt to put on a thick sweatshirt under his bee suit to thwart the insects’ long stingers. That worked—though Schmidt does sometimes regret it.“In hindsight," he says, "I kind of wish I had been stung because that would be a pertinent data point."",
"Asian giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia) have been spotted in Washington State, alarming officials.Two unusual hornets—striking, with orange and black markings and long stingers—were spotted near Blaine, Washington, in late 2019. Subsequent investigation revealed they were Asian giant hornets, the world’s largest wasps, growing nearly two inches in length.Scientists are concerned that these hornets could spread throughout Washington State and beyond, presenting a danger to U.S. bees—which are already in decline—and humans.Nobody knows how the insects arrived in the United States. But the discoveries set off alarms and the insects began trending on social media as "murder hornets.” These predators, native to East Asia and Japan, are infamous for decimating honeybee colonies.With the toxic venom that their large stingers deliver, the insects already are known for killing people in their native habitats: In Japan, an average of 30 to 50 people each year die from the hornets’ stings. In 2013, when populations of the hornets were unusually high, they killed 42 people in a single Chinese province. Most serious incidents occur when people come near or disturb the insects’ hives.These insects “are pretty formidable,” says Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture. “I am very worried.”At the same time, Looney offers some caution, starting with the nickname “murder hornet.” He hadn’t heard it before recent press coverage of the insects—and he doesn't love it.“I worry people are already scared enough of insects for dubious reasons,” Looney says. But he grants that there’s an upside to the ominous label: “It does seem to have gotten people's attention. I just hope the sensational ‘murder hornet’ coverage helps us understand our ecosystems a little better."As of now, researchers can’t confirm how the hornets arrived. Looney says it’s most likely they got accidentally trapped in shipping containers from one of the countries where they’re native.One complete hive of the insects was found and destroyed in late 2019 in nearby Nanaimo, Canada. But genetic tests suggest those giant hornets were introduced separately.Asian giant hornets from Japan and East Asia already have established themselves as invasive species in other nations, such as South Korea. These social wasps form colonies, comprising one queen and many workers, which can fly half a dozen miles or more from the hive to find food. They eat many kinds of insects, but they seem to especially enjoy feasting on bees.When they encounter honeybees, their attack starts with a “slaughter phase” in which they serially bite the heads off bees with their large mandibles, Looney explains. Within 90 minutes, a small group of Asian hornets can destroy an entire colony’s workers this way, he says.Then, the hornets shift to feeding. They occupy the honeybee nest for up to a week or longer, feeding on the pupae and larvae. They then feed it to their own young.European honeybees (Apis mellifera), the most widespread commercial pollinators, have no known defense against Asian giant hornets. Though the bees have been observed stinging the would-be invaders, it appears to have no effect on these wasps.By contrast, Japanese honeybees (Apis cerana japonica), which have co-evolved with giant hornets, have found a way to protect themselves. By swarming around the invaders and beating their wings until this “bee ball” reaches temperatures over 115 degrees Fahrenheit, the bees cook the wasps to death and suffocate them with carbon dioxide.Asian giant hornets could also have deadly impacts on pollinators like native bee species, many of which are already suffering from competition with other exotics, Looney says.Jun-ichi Takahashi, a researcher and wasp expert at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan, agrees the wasp's damage to the environment could be significant anywhere they spread—and supports efforts to contain it.Interviewed by email, Takahashi says the label murder hornet is appropriate because the species is as dangerous as killer bees, a nickname for the African honeybee. That invasive bee species arrived in Texas in 1990 and has colonized parts of the southern U.S. and caused human deaths.It’s Takahashi’s opinion that “Americans do not fully understand the aggressiveness and toxicity of this hornet.”If the hornets aren’t headed off in the next couple years, it will probably be too late to halt their spread across the United States, Looney says.As of now, there have been only two sightings of worker bees of the species near Blaine, which suggests that there is likely a colony nearby. In winter, nests go dormant, and if any queens have mated, they would disperse to form new hives. Currently, Looney and other researchers are setting out lures to try to capture emerging queens.In the summer, the researchers will set out hundreds of traps to continue looking for queens and workers, which would emerge in the summer if any new colonies are established. They could then try to attach radio-transmitting collars so they could track the wasps back to their nests and destroy them, Looney says.Because the hornets make hives underground that generate heat, Looney and colleagues are also experimenting with heat-sensitive imaging technologies to help them find the hives.Still, “It's going to be tough” to stop the hornet, Looney says. “But yeah, we have a shot at it.”Asian giant hornets have stingers a quarter-inch long, which can pierce protective clothing that beekeepers normally wear. Research shows that even in people who aren’t allergic, 50 or fewer stings can cause death due to kidney damage.Since the hornets made the U.S. news, Looney has been inundated by emails from concerned Americans who think they’ve seen the insect. In response, he stresses that only two sightings of the Asian giant hornet have been confirmed in the U.S.—and that people who think they’ve seen it in eastern North America are likely confusing it with the European hornet (Vespa crabro), which looks similar but is less aggressive and dangerous.“If people east of the Mississippi see something like that, they shouldn't assume it's an Asian giant hornet,” he says. “It's almost certainly not.”",
"The giant hornet is native to East and Southeast Asia.The world's biggest hornet is wreaking havoc in northwestern China, where 42 people have died after being swarmed and stung in Shaanxi Province, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua.Some 1,600 others have been injured since the outbreak of the Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) began in July, the regional health authority reported, and attacks continue even as local authorities take action, including destroying hundreds of hives and improving medical treatment for victims. (Watch a video of "hornets from hell.")"The problem with this particular hornet is that it's big, sort of thumb-sized, and it packs a lot of venom," said entomologist Lynn Kimsey, director of the Bohart Museum of Entomology at the University of California, Davis."And its nests get fairly large, including maybe several hundred individuals. They are aggressive, they are predatory, and they have been known to kill and eat an entire colony of honeybees," she said.At 1.5 to 2 inches (4 to 5 centimeters) long, the giant hornets are found across many parts of East and Southeast Asia and are especially well known in Japan. They're among the more dangerous venomous insects of their type, Kimsey said, though others, like Africanized bees and yellow jackets, can cause similar problems.Bee-Loving HornetsWhile the hornets don't typically swarm humans in such numbers, they're well known for their ability to quickly decimate a hive of thousands of honeybees, leaving behind a trail of severed heads and limbs.The hornets routinely fly miles from their nests and employ scouts to locate a bee colony and then mark it with a special pheromone that attracts their allies to attack, destroy, and occupy the hive.With their huge size advantage, the hornets typically make short work of the bees, unless the victims are able to eliminate the advance scout before it can summon others. They sometimes do so with an incredible defense—swarming the hornet in a ball and literally cooking it to death.Often, however, the bees and other insect victims become fodder for the growth of the hornet hive. Adult workers chew their victims' flesh into a nutritious paste that feeds larvae, which in turn produces saliva that serves as a powerful "energy drink" to be consumed by adults who cannot digest solid protein.Why Are Hornets Attacking People?It's unclear exactly what factor or factors has led to the hornets' deadly season of human attacks.Huang Rongyao, an insect expert with the Forestry Bureau of Ankang City, told Xinhua that local vegetation growth has increased hornet habitat, and that two months of hot weather have made the insects much more active. Ankang is one of the cities most affected by hornet attacks, along with Hanzhong and Shangluo.Hua Baozhen, an entomologist at China's Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, pinpointed a decrease in populations of the insect's natural enemies like spiders and birds, while other experts speculate that urban sprawl simply means more people are living in what was formerly hornet country.Kimsey noted that this type of behavior is often seen with invasive species, though she's not sure if the hornet is native to the region or how long it may have been there."What we see happen when you get a newly introduced species is that it may sort of go along relatively unnoticed for years, but then eventually you see a huge outbreak. We have that happening in California, where the European paper wasp was introduced 20 years ago, and now suddenly it's an outbreak and they are everywhere."If the hornets are in fact natives, Kimsey added, this year's weather probably does play a major part in the outbreak. "In that case I'd suspect that they had a very mild winter and spring, so that a lot of queens survived and consequently they now have many more nests than they normally would have."That scenario also has parallels in the U.S. she added, like the western yellow jacket, whose numbers have risen to "spectacular" levels in California due to recent milder weather. (Also see "Stinging Wasps Moving North Due to Warming?")Mating SeasonIn addition, autumn is mating season for hornets, which can make them more aggressive, particularly toward the end of the process, UC-Davis's Kimsey said."Right now if it's getting towards the end of the season, they are irritable. They are not producing a new brood, and there are a lot of workers not doing much of anything."Once a queen has been fertilized, a typical hive begins to shut down with the approach of cool weather; the workers will die off while the queen finds a place to overwinter.Xinhua reported that hives in the region typically go dormant by December, though attacks are expected to taper off sooner, perhaps by the end of the month. In the spring, hornet queens will begin new nesting colonies with offspring numbering in the thousands.Deadly AttacksIn the meantime, staying well clear of the hornets is the best route to safety, experts advise, but that's often easier said than done.The insect often locates nests underground or even on buildings, which puts them directly in human territory. Disturbing them or merely passing too close for the hornets' comfort can unleash a fierce retaliation. Some attacks seem especially unprovoked. In September, Xinhua reported that a swarm attacked a school in southern China, injuring 30 people—all but one of whom had to be hospitalized with multiple stings."If you inadvertently disturb a nest, they will come out en masse and you could get lots and lots of stings," Kimsey said, noting that the insect is proving deadly in much the same way a swarm of Africanized honeybees might. (Watch video: "Beware the Giant Hornets.")"Even if you're not allergic, the amount of foreign protein that circulates in your blood after so many stings can cause kidney failure. It's like sepsis, and if you don't get on dialysis you can die."People are probably dying because they aren't receiving the appropriate treatment in time," she added."And many Chinese doctors probably don't know exactly how to treat this problem, just as many doctors wouldn't in this country."",
"In a battle with Asian giant hornets, Japanese honeybees turn up the heat—quite literally—by swarming around the hornets and cooking them to death.Now scientists have found a genetic switch in the honeybees' brains that turns on during the attacks. Though the gene activity doesn't seem to trigger the behavior, it might provide leads in explaining the insects' ability to withstand the heat of so called hot defensive bee balls, a new study says.The bees' strange defensive tactic evolved because their venomous stingers are too small to pierce the thick exoskeletons of the giant hornets—insects which can grow about two inches (five centimeters) long. The quivering of muscle fibers from so many bees creates real heat that kills off the predators.European honeybee hives, common in the U.S. and Europe, are sitting ducks against the hornets' merciless raids, scientists say."These hornets go and rob honeybee colonies and the [European] bees have no chance. They can't sting through them. These hornets can bring down entire colonies," said Wulfi Gronenberg, a neuroscientist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the new study.(Watch a video of "hornets from hell" attacking bees.)Bee-Ball Genetics ProbedResearchers already knew hundreds of buzzing bees can warm the centers of "hot defensive bee balls" to about 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) for an hour without dying, according to the study. But scientists weren't certain how the insects' bodies pull off the stunt.Lacking the Japanese bees' cooking skills, a group of Japanese scientists looked into honeybees' genetic code and brain structure.They started by heating honeybees up to bee-ball temperatures and looking for unusual genetic activity in the bees' brains. The team found that at least one immediate early gene—a kind of gene that polices the function of many other genes—became much more active within the brains of Japanese honeybees compared with those of European honeybees.Specifically, the team traced the boosted genetic activity to a region of the honeybee's brain called the mushroom body. (Get a genetics overview.)"It's a pretty large area involved in learning; memory; and processing light, taste, smell and all kinds of other sensory cues," Gronenberg said.In a second experiment, the scientists staged a hornet attack on Japanese honeybees and examined the bees' brains and genetics. Those bees, too, showed increased activity in the same regions of the mushroom body.Bees' Genetic Kick May Stop Attack?The gene kicks on only minutes after a hot, defensive swarm has begun, so it's too early to tell what it does, Gronenburg said. But it's almost certain that the genetic boost plays an important role in bee-ball behavior."This cannot be the cause for forming the bee ball. The authors were careful not to interpret this too much," he said."But it may be involved in perceiving the heat. It could be a sort of timer, a signal that tells the honeybees when to stop [a bee-ball attack]."Hot bee-ball study appeared March 14 in the journal PLoS ONE.",
"Female velvet ants are wingless wasps that range in size from small, as is this quarter-inch Dasymutilla asteria, to huge, nearly one-inch “cow killers.” Their stings rate between 1–3 on the Schmidt Pain Scale.One day while Justin Schmidt was riding his bicycle, something went terribly wrong.“I was huffing and puffing, so my mouth was open, and this damn honeybee flew right in and stung me on the tongue,” he says. He tumbled to the ground, flailing in agony. Later he described the sting as “immediate, noisome, visceral, debilitating. For 10 minutes, life is not worth living.”It wasn’t the worst sting possible (we’ll get to that), but its intensity surprised him—which is surprising in itself, because Schmidt, a University of Arizona entomologist, has been stung over a thousand times and is famous for developing the Schmidt Pain Scale for Stinging Insects, a four-point scale with descriptions of agony that read like hoity-toity tasting notes for Scotch.The red paper wasp, for instance, rates a 3 with pain that’s “caustic and burning, with a distinctly bitter aftertaste. Like spilling a beaker of hydrochloric acid on a paper cut.” (See: “The Worst Places to Be Stung? Ask This Guy”)Normally a honeybee sting is nothing to Schmidt. “Boring,” he says. But on the tongue, it was a whole different matter. Clearly, where you’re stung can matter as much as what stings you.So when a Cornell graduate student named Michael Smith contacted him a few years ago with a plan to sting himself all over his body to map the pain, Schmidt had some advice: Don’t sting yourself in the eye, kid. But otherwise, go for it.Smith, who studies bee biology, had been comparing notes with beekeepers and realized that everyone knew stings hurt worse in some places than others, but no one had ever systematically measured the pain. Would pain vary reliably on different body parts? Why do some places hurt worse? “Someone’s got to do it,” he says, “so as a scientist you go out there and make it happen. It’s curiosity; that’s what motivates you.”He proceeded to sting himself with honeybees multiple times in each of 24 places on his body, from the top of his head to the tip of his middle toe, and he didn’t dodge the scary bits—the nipple, scrotum, and penis. What resulted was the most scientific look ever at the worst places to be stung.Combine that with Schmidt’s pain index by insect, and you’ve got a good roundup of worst-case scenarios for stings. And that begs a question: What’s the ultimate sting? The apotheosis of insect-induced agony?A honeybee leaves its stinger in a victim’s arm. Photographs in this article are courtesy of the book The Sting of the Wild.When I asked both scientists for the worst possible combination, they agreed that a bullet ant to the nostril would probably top the chart for intensity. Schmidt gave the bullet ant a 4 out of 4 on his index and describes the sting as “like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel.”Smith found that the two most painful places to be stung are the nostril and the upper lip, followed by the penis shaft. The penis got more attention in press coverage, but Smith says “the nostril is really where it’s at.” And it makes sense that bees often target the nose, along with the mouth and eyes—they’re crucial to breathing and vision. “Pain isn’t for nothing,” Smith says; it motivates us to protect our vital functions.But there’s one thing that Schmidt says might be even more horrific. “A warrior wasp to the nose or lip would be up there,” he says, and in some ways worse because you’d have intense swelling that could last for days. “You’d get inflated and red, and you get the misery down the line.”The bullet ant, in contrast, doesn’t cause much swelling, and in fact doesn’t even leave much of a mark.“It’s almost disappointing to go through that and be rendered a babbling idiot, crying, and not even have a big red spot to show people,” Schmidt says. “They take away even that satisfaction.”Despite the pain they’ve endured, both scientists say it’s worth it to learn about some of the world’s most fascinating animals. “I’m living the dream,” Smith says. “I’m working with bees.” Since his pain research, he has finished one of the most exhaustive studies ever of the inner workings of a beehive, measuring every detail of a colony from birth to death. And now he’s figuring out what triggers bee puberty—yes, bees and almost all other animals have some kind of puberty.I asked Schmidt what he thinks is the coolest thing he’s learned about stinging insects. “I’ve learned a strange thing,” he says. “The relationship between stinging insects and humans is really about us. It’s psychological warfare—and they’re winning. They’ve got us terrified of them.”",
"Great white sharkIf a fin rising out of the water sends a chill down your spine, it’s likely that your kids might also find sharks a little scary—along with creatures like snakes, spiders, and bees. The good news is that experts say people have little to fear from these animals. Likewise, there’s a lot to be gained from getting your kids over such animal-related anxieties.“If your kid is afraid of the water, they’re not going to experience all the other things that the oceans have to offer,” says Jasmin Graham, a marine biologist at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Florida. “The last thing you want to do is take that away from your kid.”The earlier you can expose your kids to animals like sharks, the better chance they might have at experiencing fascination rather than fear.“In my experience, when young kids see a shark for the first time, if it happens early on, then there’s no inherent fear,” says Graham, who’s also the project coordinator for the Marine Science Laboratory Alliance Center of Excellence. “They’re interested, and they don’t freak out about it.”Children also need to learn that if they give these “scary” animals space, the creatures will generally stay away. In fact, the critters usually have more to fear from humans. For instance, scientists estimate that humans kill around 100 million sharks each year, either through targeted fishing or as bycatch. But sharks kill just four humans each year, on average. “So of the two animals in this situation,” Graham says, “one is definitely a bigger threat to the other.”Scientists offer these other tips on how parents can change the narrative about “scary” animals for their kids. Who knows: You might just find them useful, too!Epaulette sharkWHY THEY’RE AWESOME: Many species of shark are the top predators in their ecosystem, which keeps other, smaller predator populations in check. (Too many of those smaller predators might gobble up many of the fish species kids like to snack on.) And with more than 500 species, kids are sure to find a fave, from the largest fish in the world—the whale shark—to the banana-size dwarf lanternshark, which has pockets on either side of its face that can light up in the dark. (Learn more about shark sizes.) Some are downright cute, Graham says, like the puppy-dog-faced epaulette sharks (above), which sometimes walk on land.HAVE NO FEAR: “One of the things I like to tell kids is, there’s only about 16 shark encounters per year in the United States,” says Graham, who also co-created the outreach group Minorities in Shark Sciences. “And that usually results in a fatality about every other year.” For comparison, dogs bite 4.5 million people in the U.S. each year. “And we bring dogs into our houses and put them in cute outfits,” she says.WHAT PARENTS CAN DO: The best thing for warding off fear and misunderstanding is exposure. Trips to the zoo or aquarium can help show kids how peaceful sharks are, while books and nature documentaries can help them geek out about cool biology and evolution without becoming fixated on fear. Then play at the beach like you’d normally do, Graham says. “Every time you get in the water there are probably about 20 sharks in that area, and you don’t see them,” she says. “They’re staying out of your way. They’re just living their lives.”Corn snakeWHY THEY’RE AWESOME: Many snake species prey upon mice and other small rodents, making them nature’s pest control squad. Research has even shown that snakes can reduce the number of ticks nearby, since ticks rely on rodents for part of their life cycle. What’s more, scientists have used snake venoms to create new medicines that control high blood pressure, break up blood clots, and lower the risk of heart attack.HAVE NO FEAR: “Humans are snakes’ predators, not the other way around,” says Earyn McGee, a herpetologist at the University of Arizona. “A snake is never going to chase you.” Snakes are sit-and-wait predators—and humans are not on the menu. “Even with venomous snakes, you can pass by really close to them and you will never know that they’re there, because they’re just being super still and hoping you won’t see them,” McGee says.WHAT PARENTS CAN DO: A great way to teach kids the value of snakes is to focus on docile, non-venomous species like garter snakes and corn snakes (above). These easy-to-handle species make great pets. (McGee recommends using a loose grip and not squeezing or confining the animal.)Bold jumping spiderWHY THEY’RE AWESOME: Having spiders around is like having a bug zapper in the corner. One study estimated that all the world’s spiders eat nearly 900 million tons of insects and other small creatures each year. Kids will also be impressed with spiders’ “superpowers,” says Sebastian Echeverri, who studies jumping spiders at the University of Pittsburgh. Spiders can walk on walls and build their own traps; some species hunt fish underwater, and a few grow large enough to take down bats and birds. (Watch an orb-weaver spider in Belize prey upon an unlucky bat.)HAVE NO FEAR: Spiders just aren’t that into attacking humans. “You are a skyscraper to a spider,” Echeverri says. “When they’re dealing with something as big as us, the safest thing for spiders to do is run away.” What’s more, just two spider species out of the 3,400 species found in North America have venom that can send you to the hospital.WHAT PARENTS CAN DO: The next time you find an arachnid in the house, Echeverri recommends slowly covering it with a glass and then sliding a piece of paper or cardboard beneath. This will allow you to get a closer look and show your kids there’s nothing to fear.Honey beeWHY THEY’RE AWESOME: Of all the animals on this list, bees are probably the most likely to ruin your child’s day with an accidental sting. But they’re also wondrous little insects that pollinate more than a hundred kinds of crops, from almonds and apples to chocolate and pumpkins. Without bees and other pollinators, 80 percent of all flowering plants on Earth might disappear.HAVE NO FEAR: “Bees are generally very gentle creatures,” says Natalie Boyle, an entomologist at Pennsylvania State University. All bees really want are flowers and other sources of nutrients. And for some species, like the European honeybee, stinging a human can result in death for the bee—further motivation for both species to leave each other alone.WHAT PARENTS CAN DO: Sitting beside a flower patch and watching buzzers show up can be fun, says Boyle, who’s put together an at-home science lesson to observe pollinators. And if one of those buzz-butts gets too close, don’t panic. “She’s not looking for a fight,” Boyle says. “Just be patient, give it some space, and don’t swat!”National Geographic’s SharkFest celebrates the ocean’s apex predators in July.

"The leopard epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium michaeli) is a species of walking shark found in coral reefs in the Milne Bay region of eastern Papua New Guinea.Sharks have roamed the world’s oceans for hundreds of millions of years. In that time, many species have barely changed. But some strange sharks are still evolving—and have even learned to walk. Meet the walking sharks.These three-foot-long creatures live near Australia, and, as their name implies, move their pectoral fins in the front and pelvic fins in the back to plod along the seafloor—or even atop coral reefs, outside the water, at low tide. Such mobility allows the sharks to wriggle between tide pools and different areas of the reef to prey upon crabs, shrimp, small fish—just about anything they can find.“During low tides, they became the top predator on the reef,” says Christine Dudgeon, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.Now, a long-term study by an international group of collaborators has turned up four new species of walking sharks since 2008, bringing the total to nine walking shark species. In a paper published this week in the journal Marine and Freshwater Research, the researchers have also shown that these species all evolved in the last nine million years.That’s highly unusual, says Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the University of Florida, since most sharks evolve slowly. Sixgill sharks, for example, denizens of the deep sea, “seem stuck back in time,” Naylor says. “We see animals from 180 million years ago with exactly the same teeth.”But the walking sharks are likely still evolving in their native tropical waters surrounding Australia, Papua New Guinea, and eastern Indonesia.“This may be the one place in the world where speciation is still going on for sharks,” Naylor says. Studying these animals will help researchers better understand the animals and why “some change, and others stay the same,” he adds. (Related: Watch a strange walking fish that has experts stumped.)About 400 million years ago, the ancestors of sharks and all other jawed vertebrates diverged. Since then, only about 1,200 species of sharks and rays have come into existence. The animals are, mostly, very slow to evolve, slow to reproduce, and long-lived, Naylor explains.In other situations, this combination of traits would make an animal less adaptable and more vulnerable to extinction, since, in many cases, continued evolution is necessary to survive changing conditions.You could say, for example, that “these things should be extinct,” Naylor says. “How do you exist for so long with a slow rate of evolution?”But sharks, obviously, are not extinct—and have flourished, outlasting many other aquatic creatures that have come and gone during their reign in the sea. Apparently, they’ve figured out a formula that works, despite an ever-changing ocean. (Related: Six amazing sharks you may not have heard of.)Walking sharks can briefly leave the water as they "walk" between tide pools, making them great predators.Naylor says that the rich coral reefs in the walking sharks’ range are dynamic, shifting continually over recent epochs as sea levels rise and fall, currents shift, reefs flourish or wither, and temperatures change. This dynamism is likely what’s driven their speedy evolution and diversity.“It’s the shark equivalent of the Galápagos, where you can see shark evolution in action.”In addition, these animals are “homebodies,” Dudgeon explains, laying eggs in the reefs and not traveling far from where they were born. This doesn’t allow a lot of gene flow—and seemingly surpassable obstacles, like small stretches of deep water—have provided enough separation for the animals to uniquely evolve in different places.Until 2008, scientists believed there were only five species of walking sharks, which are also known as epaulette sharks. Though most of these animals have similar anatomy, they have different coloration and marking patterns. The more detailed genetic analysis in the new study reveals that there are actually nine species, and exactly when they diverged from each other in the recent past.Dudgeon worked with Gerry Allen, of the Western Australian Museum, and Conservation International’s Mark Erdmann to gather DNA samples from sharks around the region, taking tiny pieces of the fins without hurting the animals. Samples from museum specimens were also used. These were then sequenced and analyzed in Naylor’s lab, and compared to create a phylogenetic tree, a genetic map of the walking shark genus, Hemiscyllium.Like most sharks, they face threats such as overfishing and harvesting for the aquarium trade. Some of the species, restricted to relatively small areas, are thus vulnerable, Dudgeon says.Since several of them are only recently well described, and little studied, there is a lack of data; only three of the nine known species are included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. Luckily, none of them are thought to be threatened or endangered yet, but in some cases, “we really just don’t know how they’re doing,” Dudgeon says.“These species have been pretty much overlooked,” she adds.",
"As the team lowered Nadir, a bulbous three-seat submarine, into the waters off of the Bahamian island of Eleuthera on June 29th, the rain that had pummeled them that afternoon began to wane. They were eager to interpret the improving weather as a good omen; a lot was riding on this dive.For the past year, a group of researchers from Florida State University, the Florida Museum of Natural History, the Cape Eleuthera Institute, and OceanX, a marine exploration initiative established by hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio, had been trying to tag a shark with a satellite tracker from a submarine for the first time in history.Their target was the bluntnose sixgill, a massive creature with glittering emerald eyes and six gills to most sharks’ five. Believed to be descendants of sharks that inhabited Earth’s waters even before pterodactyls and T. rexes roamed its lands, bluntnose sixgills spend most of their time at profound depths, sometimes swimming to 4,500 feet below the ocean’s surface.This predilection for deep water makes bluntnose sixgills a difficult bunch to study. When asked what remains mysterious about them, Simon Thorrold, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution laughs, explaining: “It will be way quicker to go over what we do know. And that is almost nothing.”The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species classifies bluntnose sixgills as “near threatened,” but there is not enough data to estimate their population or discern whether it is increasing or dwindling. Females tend to be larger than males—measuring up to 18 feet at maturity—and give birth to 40 to 110 pups at a time, but we don’t know where they breed or how long they gestate. While bluntnose sixgills appear to be rather cosmopolitan, having been spotted near the coasts of every continent but Antarctica, it is unclear whether they’re highly migratory or merely spread out.In 2005, Dean Grubbs, now the Associate Director of Research at Florida State University’s Coastal and Marine Laboratory, was the first scientist to affix a bluntnose sixgill with a satellite tag, which gathers data about light, temperature, and depth. He used a mix of bait fish to hook the shark and a long fishing line to pull it to the surface, where he placed the tag below the shark’s dorsal fin.He went on to tag more than twenty bluntnose sixgills this way in five different regions of the world. But eventually he noticed that, though the sharks survived the experience of being hauled to the ocean’s surface, they didn’t seem to resume normal behavior for a few days. Grubbs began wondering about something audacious: Why not try tagging one from a sub, in their natural deep-water environment?There were lots of reasons why not. According to the Marine Technology Society, as of 2017, there are only 14 crewed underwater submersible vehicles dedicated to science in the world. Conducting research on one of those submarines would be orders of magnitude more expensive than tagging sharks from a boat. While OceanX declined to comment on its costs, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which wasn’t involved in the bluntnose sixgill tagging project, reports that use of their 55-year-old submarine, Alvin, costs $45,000 a day. Plus, the endeavor would be tricky: With the shark unrestrained, it would be much harder to correctly position the tag.Santa Catalina Island, CaliforniaEventually, Grubbs, Edd Brooks, and Brendan Talwar—both of whom are researchers at the Cape Eleuthera Institute—convinced OceanX to back the mission, which also received funding from the Moore Bahamas Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies’ Vibrant Oceans Initiative. They would mount two spearguns on Nadir—giving them two shots at tagging a shark per night—which they would use to target bluntnose sixgills in the Exuma Sound off of Eleuthera.But despite outside support and resources, things did not immediately look promising. After practicing in a pond with a shark carcass, the team’s first trip was scuttled when a giant female sixgill turned her belly to the submarine at the exact moment when they prepared to shoot a tag at her. They didn’t want to damage her organs and abstained from firing. A speargun malfunction ruined their second trip a few months later. Finally, in June, they embarked on their third—and final— trip, which would last a total of four nights.Again, things began inauspiciously. On the first night, a sixgill knocked into the speargun, causing it to misfire. The next night, no sharks appeared. On the third night, a pesky grouper swam by at exactly the moment they had fired at a sixgill, intercepting the precious tag.June 29th represented the team’s last chance to tag a bluntnose sixgill before Nadir and the research boat that housed it would move on to another project. As the researchers inside the submarine waited for sixgills to come investigate the bait dangling outside, they marveled at phosphorescent Siphonophores, Cuban dogfish, and larval fishes usually only seen in textbooks. (Related: See nine photos of deep-sea creatures.)“I was happy as a kid in a candy store just seeing these invertebrate, these little shrimp” recalls Gavin Naylor, who directs the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History and was tasked with manning the spearguns that night.Around 9:50 p.m., which the scientists had taken to calling “sixgill-o’clock” after they noticed shark activity consistently increase then, a male sixgill swam past the sub, sending silt from the ocean floor swirling. Though he couldn’t see well, Naylor felt confident he could predict where the shark had gone. He asked Lee Frey, the sub’s pilot, to arm the speargun and fired into the sediment.A tense 20 seconds passed before Grubbs and the other scientists sitting in the research boat’s mission control area heard Frey's voice come in over the radio.“Roger, Nadir. Tag went into a large male.”The tag that Naylor applied to the sixgill has a three-month lifespan. In late September, if all goes to plan, the tag will detach from the shark, float to the surface and upload data about how deep the shark swam, how much light there was, and what water temperatures the creature spent time in. Grubbs and his team will use that information to recreate the shark’s movements.Shawn Larson, the curator of research at the Seattle Aquarium who has long studied bluntnose sixgills in the Puget Sound, is excited to see what new evidence the tag holds. “These sharks are really a mystery. I’m hoping that the tag will shed light on the shark’s home range and maybe, since it’s a male, the location of breeding grounds.”The team’s success is proof that animals can be successfully tagged in the deep sea from submersibles. They’re optimistic that this tagging will encourage the study of other deep-sea creatures in their natural environments. Ocean covers more than 70 percent of Earth’s surface, and nearly two-thirds of that water is over 5,200 feet deep. Yet only 10 percent of the world’s waters have been mapped with sonar, and scientists estimate up to two-thirds of marine life remains undiscovered. (Take the quiz: How much do you know about the deep sea?)“We really do not know much about the ocean—and the little we do know is in the top 500 meters (1,640 feet),” reflects Naylor. “But when you get down to the deep sea, it’s just uncharted. It’s really like being an 18th century explorer. And it is magical.”",

"PittsburghThey all remember the minutes, and the hours, when Tree of Life ceased to be the quiet aging synagogue on a hill.Paula Garret, running late for services, was leaving home when her phone pinged with frantic “don’t go” messages because gunshots were heard at the corner of Shady and Wilkins avenues. Andrea Wedner and her 97-year-old mom, Rose Mallinger, were sitting on a wooden pew inside when a thunderous steely rattle shook the synagogue’s walls. Get down, Wedner said in a breath too late for the gunman rounding the corner. Carol Black scurried into a dusty closet as her brother Richard Gottfried was lost forever in the chaos. Dan Leger, a congregant struck by several bullets, thanked God for a good life as he bled in a stairwell.Before noon that October day in 2018, the worst antisemitic attack in American history—at one of the oldest urban Jewish communities in the country—was over. Eleven people were murdered, and others grievously wounded, including police who fought and captured the shooter.Prayer or any sense of comfort seems unimaginable in the ruined halls today. A top-floor children’s classroom is riddled with rounds from an AR-15 rifle. Bloody carpets have been stripped to cold concrete. There are still chalk markings wherever people died. V = victim. The milky letter is etched, again and again, above door frames.Yet people in Pittsburgh, a city of 300,000, believe something good is possible in the desecrated temple that housed Tree of Life and neighboring Dor Hadash and New Light congregations. After discussions, disagreements, pulling apart and pulling together, they are salvaging the killing ground in a most American way: a new corporation—T of L Inc.—will recast its landscape and purpose.Now, at a time when hate crimes against Jewish people have increased, T of L Inc. will exist to eliminate antisemitism, and Tree of Life will tell a story of redemption, not a massacre, and how a community forged peace from a terrible loss. Studio Libeskind, a New York architecture firm led by world-class architect Daniel Libeskind, has drawn the blueprints, in counsel with Pittsburgh architect Daniel Rothschild, for a groundbreaking this year.“We’re inventing something new here,” says Jeffrey Myers, Tree of Life’s rabbi who dodged bullets that day. That means asking sensitive questions, he adds. “What’s the source of all this violence? Where does it come from? …We are, unfortunately, uniquely positioned to take that on.”Tree of Life leaders and its civic neighbors began talking weeks after burying their dead. They decided that something must be done.Former synagogue president Paula Garret joined hundreds of volunteers who sorted through daily mundanities in the aftermath, including opening thousands of letters and emails from as far away as Mumbai.“We knew this as a horrible attack, and, yes, the worst antisemitic attack on U.S.  soil,” says Garret. “But the response was broader than that. From Jews, non-Jews, Muslims, Christians, survivors of other shootings. We kept thinking: what can we do with that?”Less than a month after the shooting, Rothschild, who decades earlier had designed a modest extension to the synagogue, received a phone call asking if he would take a tour of battered temple. He joined several past presidents on a walk through the entire building until they entered the bullet-ridden chapel. “We stood in silence,” Rothschild says. “They asked: ‘So what do you think we should do?’” Rothschild was blunt: “I don’t know, but right now, this has nothing to do with architecture.”Rothschild had long helped communities stunned by disasters or deprivation. His firm, Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, had worked in earthquake-shattered Haiti and in tough areas of Newark, N.J. He told Tree of Life leaders to proceed with caution.“Every person is still trying to process this,” Rothschild advised. “Let’s help relieve people of the thoughts rattling around in their heads.” He volunteered to hold “listening sessions” to explore the loss of a community pillar.He met with about 160 people in small groups over the next year to share memories. Some missed their home for Shabbat. Others recounted weddings and bar mitzvahs. Rothschild asked them to write a sentence or a word on Post-it Notes. Did they have hope?By the end of 2019, Rothschild had collected about 2,000 words that captured the lingering sentiments:  “sadness” and “grief” abounded. But feelings of being “optimistic,” “hopeful,” and “energized” were rising in number. Rothschild created a data bubble, reflecting the thoughts about 10/27, the date often used as a verbal shorthand for the attack. The good was outweighing the bad.“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” he says. “There was definitely pain and anger and negative thoughts, but something had happened by people talking and hearing each other. They began thinking about what comes next…they started to heal.”Deadly shootings have bloodied acres of America, and communities often stagger for years to reclaim places of slaughter.Mother Emmanuel AME church in South Carolina held services four days after a gunman shot dead nine people at prayer. Other communities have found themselves unable to return. Parkland, Florida plans to demolish the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where 17 people died in the 2018 mass shooting. The Pulse nightclub in Florida, where 49 people were shot to death in 2016, remains closed. Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, where 26 people were gunned down in 2012, was leveled, and a new school built.The Jewish community of Tree of Life dates from the 1860s but the synagogue’s heyday had long passed by 2018. Its rooftop was beginning to rust and stained-glass windows sagged. The sanctuary could seat 1,200 people but all three congregations drew only a few hundred for services and that only on high holy days. Dor Hadash and New Light settled into other synagogues soon after the attack, with no plans to return.If Tree of Life was to rebuild, who would come? Should a revision reflect grief?The leadership put out an open call for architects to help.Seventy-six-year-old Libeskind—who landed in New York as a 10-year-old immigrant, leaving Poland for Israel then America—has documented trauma and history in magnificent ways in his career. He designed the Jewish Museum of Berlin to reflect the scars of the Holocaust and political times that spiraled into terror. His own family lost 85 relatives in Nazi-occupied Poland. Libeskind also was the master planner of New York’s 9/11 site; he listened to sufferers as well the politically connected to wrest beauty from a colossal graveyard.As he considered the scenes in western Pennsylvania, Libeskind felt a bond. Tree of Life was attacked in part because the Dor Hadash congregation supported HIAS, a nonprofit group that helps refugees. HIAS, founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, had settled Libeskinds’ family decades earlier. “The attack that was planned—and it was very well planned—was not just antisemitic. It was anti-American,” Libeskind says. “It’s against the founding principles of America.”The 45,000-square-foot complex had to remain authentic, Libeskind says. “In Berlin, it was about reflecting the abyss, about the genocide that was from the city. In Pittsburgh, it is an event, a terrorist attack on Jews and an antisemitic attack to kill Jews on Shabbat. It’s not to be museum. It’s a place for prayer, for bar mitzvahs, for everyday life.“It’s about hope,” Libeskind says. “But it has to reflect all that happened, not just the attack. There was a community that quickly came together. Christians, Muslims, it was all about solidarity. It wasn’t just a response of Jews and about Jews…This effort to rebuild is about the power of people to create communities across boundaries.”“People here might think this (project) is about Pittsburgh,” adds Studio Libeskind partner, Carla Swickerath, “but it resonates far beyond that.”Libeskind and Swickerath returned, time and again, to meet congregants. Libeskind has a reverence for memory in his work. This site, he said, “could not suffer amnesia.” Within a year, they unveiled a design to “balance the light with the darkness.”Towering stained glass, in the chapel and the sanctuary, will remain. A huge skylight will cut through the length of the roof. The synagogue will be halved, with spaces carved out for study, films, even yoga. The Pittsburgh Holocaust Center will eventually move in; nearby Chatham University will develop programming. There will be a memorial for the 11 dead. “This will all speak to resilience. Of people who continue to believe. Who have not lost hope,” Libeskind says. “In many ways, Pittsburgh is a model American city, a place where people learned and continue to learn, how to live together.”What binds those who experienced the attack in 2018 is that they are so grateful for life—even if they differ on ways to remember the dead.Wedner’s parents were synagogue stalwarts and generations prayed there. She says she knew, as bullets crackled, that her mother, Rose Mallinger,  was gone. Today Wedner bears deep scars on her arm and hand that limit her dexterity. But she speaks with certainty about what her mother would want. That her daughter sees much to live for and that Tree of Life rebounds.“You can’t go back and change what happened,”  says Wedner, 66, adding that the new building will “be a memorial to mom but also to a family tradition. Before it was just a synagogue. Now it’s going to be much more.”Black, a member of New Light, has no intention of praying, ever, at Tree of Life. She crossed its threshold once after her brother Richard Gottfried was slain, and “I am never doing it again,” she says. “I’ve made friends, very good friends, from the other congregations. But we don’t agree on this particular issue…I mean, there are always disagreements among family. You don’t stop loving each other because of a disagreement.”The physical building was never that important, says Leger, the member of Dor Hadash who bled in a stairwell then endured multiple surgeries over four years from the gunshot wounds. The rebuild seems immaterial, no matter how beautiful. “Can I find peace and solace again in my life? Of course, I can,” Leger says. “Listen, life is hard. Bad things happen—and they have always happened. It’s what you do next that matters. Hate back? That doesn’t give anyone peace.”“If the building is just a memorial that reminds everyone of what happened, it is a waste of money,” says Leger, 74. “If it achieves the goal of having people think about how to stop antisemitism—or even if it stops one act of hate—then it is good.”",
"It happened here.We knew it could happen here when we learned that nine people were killed in 2015 in the historic Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. We knew it could happen here when we learned that six were killed in the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City in 2017.The Tree of Life synagogue is roped off with police tape. This is the place of worship where 11 people were killed by Robert Bowers on Saturday, October 27, 2018. The site has become a community memorial to give voice to the senseless hatred and violence.The latest here, in late October, was Squirrel Hill, home of a dozen synagogues and for more than a century and a half not only the spiritual center of Pittsburgh Judaism but also, along with New York’s Lower East Side and Boston’s Blue Hill Avenue, one of America’s vital centers of Jewish identity since the beginning of the machine age.Here—amid the kosher establishments on Murray Avenue, the Judaica shops on Forbes Avenue, the jeweler closed on Saturdays but open on Sundays, one of the few Dunkin’ Donuts in the country, and almost certainly the only Italian ice emporium regularly inspected by rabbis, and the landmark clocktower with Hebrew letters at the center of Squirrel Hill—reigned a profound sense of security. It was, in the argot of the contemporary campus, a safe place.There was no escaping that, in the eternal mix of irony and tragedy that is the human story, the anti-Semitic rampage at Tree of Life synagogue has inflicted deep wounds on perhaps the least anti-Semitic city in the country.Here—by the kosher grocery and the kosher restaurant and the kosher-style deli, and where the knotted fringes of tzitzit are familiar features of the garments of the Orthodox who mingle on the streets with secular Jews and Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim neighbors—it didn’t require social media for word to spread. The news of what would be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history was in the air, along with the shock and the shrieks of pain, the grief and the gruesome details, the worst of which were confirmed within hours.You could hear it in the sirens that broke the stillness of the morning and shattered the serenity of the Saturday routines at the cleaners, at the shoe store, at the hotcake house. No need, of course, in a place like this to identify the name of the cleaners, the shoe store, the hotcake house. Everyone knows them, just as they know the names of almost everyone along Forbes Avenue at any time of the day.And precisely because everyone knows everyone around here—the one immutable Squirrel Hill truth that is at once irritating and comforting—the news that raced down the street as noon approached Saturday was about a rare stranger in this peaceful place: dread.Dread that someone you knew was in morning prayers marking the beginning of a baby’s new life.Dread that the police officers who sped to the scene—there were scores of them, almost as if it were a police funeral, for it was clear that soon there could be one—were in danger.Dread, too, that our country, our city, our neighborhood, our lives have come to this, and that this type of violence, rooted in hate, had come here.Before long the whole tragic scene was on television, and there was David Johnson, the WPXI anchor, on the sidewalk with a microphone and a camera crew. He lives here in Squirrel Hill, mere blocks away. On the scene, too, was Ken Rice, the KDKA anchor, and his crew. He and his wife, Lauren, took their pre-marriage lessons at the temple just down the street.Then there also was the downtown businessman, a Squirrel Hill resident since he was three days old; everyone knows his name, too, though he didn’t want it used in this account. He was in the Five Points Bakery, hard by the synagogue. He was there to buy a morning muffin for his wife. But the line was too long, so he headed back home, down Wilkins Avenue and toward Fifth, and this is what he saw:Pittsburgh's Police Station in Zone 4 on Northumberland Street was the first on the scene when the shooting began. The entire community showed their gratitude with letters and food. Appreciation and thank you notes from the children are pinned up along the wall.“There were four, maybe six officers, and they rushed into the synagogue with guns. Then I saw the officers start to fire and back out and I saw what looked like gunfire from the synagogue. And I saw an officer holding his arm being escorted out. And the next thing I knew there were cops all over the place.”The very next thing he did was call me, the executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, because he knew I lived only three blocks away from the synagogue and he knew this was news of the worst but most important kind.And soon Rabbi James A. Gibson of Temple Sinai, the Reform synagogue that is nearly a neighbor of Tree of Life, was on the phone. “We’re stunned that the peace of Shabbat was destroyed by murderous intent and act,” he said, the words spilling forth in a Niagara of disbelief unusual for a man of devout belief. “We cannot comprehend what happened. It’s a tragedy for us all, and especially for those who are victims.”This was, to be sure, a 21st-century event, with all the trademark elements: Gunfire in a house of worship. Text messages flying at the speed of bullets. (Mine came from Saskatchewan and Alberta and Ontario, from a nephew at Yeshiva University in New York, and brothers and my sister from Boston's North Shore and from neighbors the next street over.) And of course: Confusion, and then clarity, over how many dead, how many wounded.And there was confusion, but no clarity, about what this meant, and whether the toxic political and cultural environment caused this, or merely reflected it.If the story of the American Jewish community is an extraordinary tale of resistance and resilience, anguish and achievement, then the story of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community is even more remarkable. It was here that immigrant Jews built a home during gritty Industrial Revolution days, that Reform Judaism planted perhaps its deepest roots anywhere, and that—perhaps alone among American cities Jewish life did not migrate to the fresh, clean suburbs but remained urban, plucky, streetwise.Jewish life in Pittsburgh is planted here, in Squirrel Hill, where the Tree of Life building at the corner of Wilkins and Shady Avenues houses three congregations, each practicing a distinctive strain of their shared faith.Twins, Ronna Wedner Levin (right) and her sister, Robin Exler (left) have prepared most of the flowers for the funerals. The flower shop was opened by their father, Norman, almost 80 years ago. The entire family goes to Tree of Life synagogue.Here the parade to prayer of observant Jews down Wightman Street every Friday just before sundown is unremarkable.Here, last year, David Zubik, the Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, and Aaron Bisno, the rabbi at Rodef Shalom Congregation, boarded a plane together at Pittsburgh International and led a trip to Rome and Jerusalem. They called it the Pursuers of Peace Pilgrimage. Nobody thought that was the least bit remarkable. In recent weeks, when Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, Bishop Zubik’s predecessor at the Diocese of Pittsburgh, came under fire in the church abuse scandal, some of the deepest expressions of sadness about his role came from Pittsburgh Jews who remembered him as a constant presence in their pews.Here the Jewish Community Center is actually the community center, frequented by men and women of all faiths, 40 percent of them not Jewish. “We will stay to our regular schedules as much as possible,” Brian Schreiber, the center’s president, said that Saturday evening.Here Jewish and Protestant clergy swapped pulpits amid the 19th-century soot of the Industrial Revolution. Here, in the year after the 1892 Homestead steel strike, Rosh Hashanah services were conducted in the club room of the volunteer fire company’s engine house, down the street from where union activists and Pinkerton agents engaged in one of the bloodiest labor battles in U.S. history. Here, in 1885, the tensions between identity and assimilation took their form in perhaps the most important document of Reform Judaism, the Pittsburgh Platform.Here the story is told of how a Protestant minister marked the founding of Tree of Life by attending the ceremonies in 1883, and then marked it again a quarter-century later when the congregation moved to a new venue.Here the streets were clogged with mourners hours after the shooting for a post-massacre vigil, organized in large measure by high school students. The mystery was why one of the most prominent rabbis around was missing. He was attending a wedding; Jewish tradition dictates that joy supersedes tragedy.Here, at the same spot, the roads were clogged on the first day of the funerals, people standing in solemn respect as the hearses passed by the streets where, as Lerner and Loewe would put it, enchantment this day did not pour out of every door.Here livery and boarding stables, and a school with five classrooms, along with the mansions of the Mellons and Queen Anne and Colonial Revival homes, made for a model community across the decades and generations. There was, of course, a settlement house, and a Young Men’s Hebrew Association, and a Jewish Home for the Aged. Now that the community is completely settled, there are multiple Jewish homes for the aged, and aged Jews in their own homes.Eleven candles have been pasted on the windows of the Carnegie Library in Squirrel Hill to represent the 11 lives that were taken on October 27, 2018. The library overlooks the usually busy intersection that is deserted on Friday, November 1, 2018, due to the funerals of the victims.Here, even a century and a half later, there were priests and rabbis and ministers and more. Here there were reform movements aplenty. Here there were civic associations. Here there now is an active Squirrel Hill Historical Society, examining it all, drinking in the moment.Here Theodore Dreiser wrote for a local newspaper. Here Willa Cather also wrote for a local newspaper and, in the house next door to mine, wrote the luminous novel O Pioneers!, which includes the insight that “we are not all made alike.” Here one of the pioneers of the gay-marriage movement, Evan Wolfson, Class of 1974 at Taylor Allderdice High School, grew up. Here one of the pioneers of space flight, astronaut Jay Apt, a veteran of four Shuttle missions, was born and raised his two daughters.Here, quite literally in Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, lives Rich Fitzgerald, the county executive, and, a field goal away, Mike Tomlin, the coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who began his press conference after that week’s football triumph to assert he was a “member of the Squirrel Hill community” and that “words cannot express how we feel.” The coach passes Tree of Life every weekday when he takes his children to the public school where, two generations ago, the historian David McCullough first was inspired with a love of history.Here Annie Dillard grew up, and in her memoir said that, “We children lived and breathed our history—our Pittsburgh history, so crucial to the country’s story and so typical of it as well.” The epigraph to that volume is a quote from Psalm 26, which speaks of “the beauty of thy house and the place where dwells thy glory.” The book’s title is An American Childhood.Here there was enough serious music written to permit WQED, the local classical music station, to devote an entire program to memorial pieces written by Squirrel Hill residents.Here the local politicians take out new-year’s advertisements at Rosh Hashanah in the Jewish newspaper because not to do so would be unseemly.Eli Vogel was traveling home to New Jersey and felt compelled to stop to sing his prayers at the memorial. He stood in the rain for an hour singing. As he packed up his guitar, he said he was singing for the victims lost and also for everyone—for all brothers and sisters. Then he began to cry and said, "I have lived in Jerusalem where violence is very close and I had to ask myself—am I safer here or there? And I have to say I am safer there. At least there I know who my enemy is."“We are the heartbeat of Squirrel Hill,” said Jim Busis, chief executive and publisher of the Jewish Chronicle, which can trace its origins to the 1890s. “Some of our readers are professionally involved with Jews. Some of them are people who are just interested. And if you want to see ads for the restaurants in Squirrel Hill, we are the place.”The Squirrel Hill enclave, and the rest of the city of Pittsburgh, is a complex place, but also a meeting place of the cultures.More than a third of the city is Catholic. The bishop always interrupts his Midnight Mass processional—stopping at the seventh row from the altar every Christmas Eve—to give a hug to the rabbi whose synagogue is down the street from the cathedral. There are six kosher food establishments in a two-block area of town. Yet the city’s signature sandwich is an unkosher mess of meat and creamy coleslaw, with fries mashed atop the glop.The garment of choice every Friday before a Steelers game is a black-and-gold Ben Roethlisberger or Antonio Brown shirt. Hours later, at sundown, the attire of choice, at least for those whose pedestrian figures blend into the dusk, is the black garb of the Orthodox and the observant on their solemn march to Sabbath prayers.A former conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra lived here. So did my daughter’s high school classmate Cameron Jibril Thomaz. You may know him as the rapper, songwriter and actor Wiz Khalifa. My other daughter went to school with Malcolm McCormick. You may know him as Mac Miller, another rap artist, this one with a huge “Chai,” the Hebrew letter signifying “life,” on his arm. He was buried in September in the same Pittsburgh cemetery as the jazz pianist and composer Eroll Garner, who gave the world “Misty” and so many other classics of the middle of the last century.The Stanford Law professor G. Marcus Cole, a black man who moved to Squirrel Hill as a child, tells the story of how his white neighbors rescued his father from a beating by a mob of white men. Bare-headed police officers who clearly have more ties to Ireland than to Israel stood guard at the Yeshiva School along Murray Avenue as the students, in black hats, walked to morning prayers in the days after the massacre. Some of their colleagues in police blue stood guard a half-mile away, near the synagogue. Someone brought them sugar cookies.It did not go unnoticed that the man who attacked the Tree of Life was taken to a hospital whose president was Jewish, was treated by a Jewish emergency-room doctor and, moments after spewing in the hospital alcove that “all Jews have to die,” was ministered over by a nurse whose father was a rabbi.On that cursed Saturday morning, when gunfire broke out in Tree of Life, just three blocks from my home, the Jewish rhythms that are a part of the city’s beat seemed to take over the soundtrack of Pittsburgh. There was an irresistible pull to migrate to the corner of Murray and Forbes, where in the 18th century a stockade, built to repel Indian attacks, once stood until the area became a place of peace. There were, to be sure, rabbis in that vigil crowd, but the vigil was dominated by the students from nearby Taylor Allderdice High School. For decades the few students in attendance in their school on Yom Kippur spent the day in study halls. There was no use teaching class during the High Holy Days.A woman stops to pray at a memorial at the other end of the block where the Tree of Life synagogue is located.Also in the crowd that night was the Rev. Glenn Grayson, pastor of the Wesley Center AME Zion Church. “A tragedy for Squirrel Hill is a tragedy for the Hill,’’ he said of the historically black Hill District. ‘’It’s a tragedy for the whole city.”There was no debate in our offices at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette—where for years the reporter Steve Levin, gray beard drooping from his chin, black cap sitting on his skull, wrote luminous tone poems—about whether to describe Saturday’s massacre as a hate crime. The man charged with perpetrating it, who in his online biographic profile asserted that “Jews are the children of Satan,” reportedly shouted anti-Semitic epithets as his gun spewed bullets. Around here angry shouts are reserved for the Cleveland Browns, bitter rivals to the north but a team that traveled to Heinz Field for a Sunday confrontation that suddenly seemed to lose its urgency.“We’re thankful for the victory but we all understand there are bigger things, there’s life,” Roethlisberger, the quarterback, said in the locker room. Two days later he joined 100 members of the Steelers, players and staff alike, at the funeral of Cecil and David Rosenthal, brothers of Michele Rosenthal, former community relations manager for the NFL team. Former Steeler defensive end Brett Kiesel, a Mormon, was a pallbearer for one of the Rosenthals. At the same time, T-shirts began to appear featuring the Steelers logo with a Star of David substituted for one of the three famous diamond-shaped hypocycloids that is their internationally known logo. That evening, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the hockey team, observed 11 seconds of silence, one for each of the victims.Squirrel Hill is slightly more diverse than it once was—it’s no longer, as piano instructor Jeffry Harris puts it, “a Jewish ghetto where the high school had a totally Jewish feel.” And yet the Jewish character remains. The non-Jews in the area pronounce Yiddish words correctly, a task their Jewish neighbors do not always master. On Sukkot, the harvest-oriented holiday that this year was marked between September 23 and September 30, it is not unusual to see a street crowded with sukkahs, the temporary structures built during the holiday. And on snowy December days, many automobiles crawl along the white-dusted streets with large menorahs, the candelabras used in Hanukkah observances, on the roof.At the end of the block where the synagogue is located children have hung stars on the police barricades in memory of the victims and acknowledgement of the tragedy that has struck the community.“This community is strong enough to survive this,” said Rabbi Keren Gorban of Temple Sinai, just a few blocks from Tree of Life. “But this is an all-too-common event in all of our communities.”But it is this community that is hurting now. The Rosenthal brothers, ages 54 and 59, were special-needs adults for whom Sabbath visits to Tree of Life were anchors in their routine—"an outlet, and source of comfort,” one of their friends said. Both were killed in the choke of gunfire Saturday. One of those injured was Andrea Wegner, a dental hygienist, who took her mother, Rose Mallinger, to services every Saturday. Mallinger, age 97, died there Saturday.“I knew most of these people,” said David Dinkin, 95, said of the victims. For years, he served as executive director of Tree of Life, part of the time as school principal and, for a year after the rabbi died, he conducted the services there. “Some of them, I have known for all my life. One guy called me up a few days ago and asked me why I hadn’t been to temple for a while. I would have gone Saturday, but I woke up too late.”The next day the synagogue he almost visited—now transformed into a crime scene—was festooned with flowers, messages, small expressions of big sentiments.More than two decades ago I walked the streets of London in the days after the death of Princess Diana. Those streets, too, were clotted with memorials. But this was different. This was home, the flowers were dropped their by our neighbors, the victims were people we encounter at the Giant Eagle market or across the cold pie counter of the Eat’n Park. Two of them hid during the shooting spree in a custodial closet. One of those in the closet did not come out alive.As a result Pittsburgh spent days ahead in grief, in prayer, in doubt and in fear.The grief was for the 11 dead; the prayer was for the rest of us, left numb and bewildered and bent limp by unendurable loss. The doubt was for the erosion of confidence that a civilization based on the centuries-old conceit of openness can so endure. And the fear was for what might come next, in some other neighborhood, in some other community, in some other house of worship, or school, or shopping mall.There was also thanks—to first responders, some of whom were injured in the shooting, all of whom exemplified what local TV icon Fred Rogers, in a Commencement address at Dartmouth College in 2002, called “heroism in the midst of chaos.” In that same address, Mister Rogers, who died the following year, spoke of “the erosion of the Sabbath.” Surely he could not have imagined that 16 years later that his neighborhood would be the setting for such a defiling of the Sabbath.The shooting prompted expressions of sadness and calls for civility from political figures across the ideological spectrum and from both parties. But its occurrence so close to vital midterm elections—and coming during the same week as the pipe bombs and a Kroger grocery-store shooting—inevitability added a strain of controversy to the condolences. Two Democratic candidates seeking re-election, Governor Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey, were in Pittsburgh for campaign events, so they had a high profile in the hours after the shooting. President Donald Trump, who stirred controversy when he said that armed guards would have prevented the tragedy, swiftly scheduled a visit to the region.But pugilists on both sides of the aisle generally came to understand that political debates were for another day. The midterm elections, to be sure, were a week away. The funerals were only days away. Before Squirrel Hill voted, it had to bury its dead—and bake cakes. As the next Sabbath following the shooting approached, Temple Sinai sent out a message urging congregants to ‘’bake something for Friday night,’’ adding: ‘’No need to let us know what you are bringing. Just do it, if it will make you feel good.’’This was an episode that attracted national and international attention, but for us it was a story about our neighborhood, caught in the crossfire of the strains of the global village, and for once—sadly, so very sadly—the hurt was ours, and the victims were ours, and the need to heal is ours, no matter how many gluten-free cakes were baked. For now it has happened here; for millions across this wounded nation, we are the focus of anguish and anger and solace, the it-can-happen-anywhere place of the moment. And we know, given the tempo of tragedy in these times that are ours, that the title won’t be ours for long.Though the scars will endure, the old rituals of Squirrel Hill nonetheless will return. ‘’We as a caring community will only grow stronger,’’ said the children of Bernice and Sylvan Simon, who were married in the Tree of Life and who died there, together, 62 years later. That is a hope, but not a certainty.On the Sabbath it is the custom here—practiced not only by Jews—to greet neighbors with a hearty ‘’Shabbat Shalom,’’ mixing the Hebrew words for the day of rest and the hope for peace. On that Saturday, here, there was no Shalom in Shabbat. On that Saturday, our younger daughter, 18 months from rabbinical ordination, planned a memorial gesture at Hebrew Union College. On that Saturday, our older daughter, in faraway San Francisco, texted us simply: Sleeping in my Pittsburgh shirt tonight.In our mourning—shared across all faiths—and in the new conviction that this might not be such a safe place anymore, we need something to lean on, to steady us.Amid the clamor and the grief we might have reflected on the passage from Proverbs that lent its name to this place of tragedy, a reference to the metaphor describing Judaism’s most sacred text, the Torah, as a tree of life, or, in transliterated Hebrew, Etz hayyim:It is a tree of life to all who hold fast to it; its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace.",
"National Geographic photographer Lynn Johnson had just landed at Pittsburgh’s airport last Saturday, October 27, 2018, when the pilot told passengers there was a medical doctor who needed to get off the plane.A young woman ran up the aisle. “This was a trauma surgeon who was racing to work,” says Johnson.As passengers turned on their cell phones, word of the massacre at Tree of Life synagogue spread.“It was like a local version of 9/11,” Johnson says of the moment she learned what had happened.National Geographic photographer Lynn Johnson arrived at the Tree of Life synagogue around midnight Tuesday, October 30, 2018, and found a young man, Isaac, sitting on the ground. A Pittsburgh resident, like Lynn, he too had been worshipping nearby on Saturday when the shooting happened.The Tree of Life synagogue is roped off with police tape. This is the place of worship where 11 people were killed by Robert Bowers on Saturday, October 27, 2018. The site has become a community memorial to give voice to the senseless hatred and violence.Johnson has worked as a National Geographic photographer for 28 years. She has covered tragedy for decades, walking through Jasper, Texas and other towns where people have been killed because of hate. She wrote her graduate thesis at Ohio University on hate crimes. And she has pushed her own graduate students at Syracuse University to explore the uncomfortable. But this was different.“I was born here,” she says. “This is my hometown. One thinks it can never happen in your hometown.”This child was born Ella Jane Silver. On October 27, 2018 at 9:45 a.m. she became Yisraela, child of Israel, during her baby naming ceremony at Temple Sinai in Pittsburgh. As she was being blessed, 11 people were losing their lives to hate violence less than a mile away at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Her mother, Lauren Sonkin Silver, wants to raise her daughter as one who is aware of her heritage, history, and faith. Both maternal grandparents are survivors of the brutality in the camps during World War II.Johnson lived in the Squirrel Hill enclave for seven years when she was a photographer for the Pittsburgh Press. The two brothers who were killed at the synagogue, Cecil and David Rosenthal, lived at the end of her street.“There’s virtually no degree of separation,” Johnson says. “If you’re removed you can pretend independence. I can’t pretend that here. It’s tough to have distance when it’s your town. Every photographer I’ve seen at the site is completely conflicted about raising the camera to their eye.”At first, Johnson couldn’t do it. “I walked up to one of the temples where one of the funerals was and I turned around and walked away. I called and said ‘I’m not doing this.’ ”At the end of the block where the synagogue is located children have hung stars on the police barricades in memory of the victims and acknowledgement of the tragedy that has struck the community.The moment reminded her of the time she was asked by a newspaper city editor “to go and ask a mom for a photograph of her dead child,” Johnson says.“I did it but I vowed I would never do it again. Going to the synagogue felt like that.”Later, Johnson would make her way to Pittsburgh’s memorial to honor the lives lost. She says she wanted to see who was there in the rain.“I never work in my hometown,” she says. “I haven’t worked in this city for years and years and years.”“You don’t see anything when it’s your hometown,” Johnson adds. “We depend on the heightened and the extreme, and now I’m looking for the daily, and the subtle and the brief. Close personal relationships are what makes Squirrel Hill so special, which is why this loss is so profound.”Several women trained in using their dogs for therapy sit outside the Commonplace Coffeehouse to make a positive “therapet” moment available to passersbys.Twins, Ronna Wedner Levin (right) and her sister, Robin Exler (left) have prepared most of the flowers for the funerals. The flower shop was opened by their father, Norman, almost 80 years ago. The entire family goes to Tree of Life synagogue.While working on her master’s thesis on hate crimes Johnson interviewed Pittsburgh native Fred Rogers, famous for the American television show Mister Rogers Neighborhood, whom she had photographed for many years including for Life magazine.During the interview, Johnson says, “he asked, ‘Is your neighbor worth loving?’ That’s the project I would like to do. I see this as a kind of introduction to thinking about that.”Girls from the Yeshiva School deliver the police officers from Zone 4 station Dunkin’ Donuts and handwritten thank you letters to show their appreciation for their role in preventing more deaths at the Tree of Life shooting.Johnson is still trying to make sense of what drives people to do terrible things. Earlier this year she photographed a story on the science of good and evil for National Geographic.“The man who did the violence, what happened in his life that he’s that obsessed,” she asks. “What’s happening in our national discourse that he felt he had permission to do this violence? That’s something as a nation we have to address every day.”Debra Adams Simmons: You’ve done some really challenging work this year. How are you able to remain poised for such intense assignments?Lynn Johnson: It's practice over many years and in many difficult situations, but fundamentally I think it is centered in a belief in the value of our profession as those who witness. I have also come to understand in my mature years, the value of listening (and not photographing) to someone's story. Sometimes it is all we have to give.Every Shabbat evening, the Beck family (seated on the floor) light candles and say the ritual blessing, then each member of the family shares what they are thankful for. The shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue was on their daughter Rachel's mind. She said, "I'm thankful that none of us died." Rachel is 4-years-old.Wasi Mohamed (left), excecutive director of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, Issac Herzog (right), an Israeli politician, and Temple Sinai's rabbi, Jamie Gibson (center), gather for the first shabbat after the shooting.DAS: How is this Pittsburgh assignment different than all the others?LJ: I never work in my hometown. When working for National Geographic we are always looking for the extreme—the intimate and universal in one frame, and somehow that is more easily seen when in unfamiliar terrain. The everyday, the familiar flattens out the moment.The goal in this story is to confirm the special quality of a community. That alone is illusive and subtle. To find such moments at a time when people are burying their loved ones or feeling guilt or rage is quite a challenge. The daily is on hold right now.A woman stops to pray at a memorial at the other end of the block where the Tree of Life synagogue is located.DAS: If National Geographic had not called, would you have picked up your camera to chronicle this moment?LJ: No, I would have picked up my phone to witness but not to publish—at least in this time of news.It is so rare to be able to be fully human and experience life not as a journalist but as one who is present. This would have been one of those opportunities. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the chance to confirm what is special about my hometown.Also, thanks to working with National Geographic, I have had the privilege to do more long-form work and so am oriented to that approach. I'd much rather pursue this idea of visually asking and answering the question that Mr. Rogers once posed to me when I was working on my thesis, which was about hate crimes, "Is your neighbor worth loving?"This is the challenge of our times, whether a participant or observer.",
"During a recent night dive off the coast of Bali, Indonesia, a diver named Emeric Benhalassa noticed something odd.A fish appeared to be walking across the seafloor on a pair of legs.Benhalassa, a French cook who dives in his free time, suspected it was a type of stingfish, which are among the most venomous fish on Earth."The stingfish came to meet me probably thanks to the light," he says by email. It was "bizarre and pretty ... I thought that this could please the Internet."Scientists contacted for this story agree that the odd creature is likely a member of the genus Minous, more commonly known as stingfish. (See Pictures: "'Walking' Fish a Model of Evolution in Action.")"They have venom glands at the base of the dorsal spines and when the spine is pushed into a person’s skin, the venom is essentially injected into the wound," says Jeff Williams, collections manager and ichthyologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.Of course, stingfish don’t actually have legs. Instead, parts of the fish’s pectoral fins have separated through evolution. According to Hiroyuki Motomura, a marine biologist at the Kagoshima University Museum in Japan, stingfish and their relatives use these “pectoral filaments” to probe the mud for worms and crustaceans. (See more pictures of strange-looking sea creatures.)But experts are less sure about its species, in part because it's so difficult to tell the difference between closely related fish species without holding a specimen in your hands.For his part, Williams thinks the animal is a striped stingfish, Minous trachycephalus.W. Leo Smith, an ichthyologist at the University of Kansas’s Biodiversity Institute, disagrees based on subtleties of tail coloration.“I don't think it is M. trachycephalus because M. trachycephalus has a tail with alternating dark and light stripes,” says Smith. Instead, he guesses the fish is a painted stinger, M. pictus, because it has “a pale tail, but is equally stubby and similarly colored.” (See "Pictures: Nine Fish With 'Hands' Found to Be New Species.")Stuart Poss, an ichthyology research associate at the California Academy of Sciences, says there’s a chance it could be either of those species and adds yet another possibility: M. quincarinatus, more commonly known as the whitetail goblinfish.Of course, it’s also possible that the hot-stepping stingfish belongs to an entirely new species. This is what Motomura believes. In fact, it may be one of the new species that he and a student, Yukino Ando, are working to describe. It's "very lucky to record the new species,” says Motomura.While the stingfish in Benhalass’s video certainly looks conspicuous enough, little is known about the animal’s behavior or biology. This is probably because stingfish spend most of the day embedded in mud and are thus rarely seen by divers. (Read "Our Fishy Ancestors Had Fins Made for Walking.")Most specimens get hauled out of the deep by fishermen looking for shrimp. Some of them even end up on dinner plates in Asia: “It is one of the most delicious fishes, and a very high price fish in Japan,” says Motomura.However, elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Motomura says, stingfish are thrown back into the ocean because they are believed to be devils.Thanks to the fish’s rarity, videos are valuable for unveiling more details about their secretive lives. “This video gives us information on their walking behavior for the first time," he says.As for the amateur diver, Benhalassa, he plans to keep diving. "In our ocean," he says, "we have enormous things to find."Follow Jason Bittel on Twitter and Facebook.",
"A shortfin mako swims through turquoise waters off the coast of New Zealand's North Island.When people think of sharks, they often picture a great white or a hammerhead—but these popular predators represent a very small proportion of global shark diversity.There are over 520 shark species— a fifth of which have been found in the past decade. You’ve probably never heard of the tiny cookiecutter shark or the Arctic-dwelling Greenland shark, but that doesn’t mean these creatures aren’t worthy of your attention. (Explore the interactive graphic “Sizing Up Sharks, the Lords of the Sea.”)Not only are sharks beautiful—photographer Brian Skerry calls them “a blend of grace and power that lures me into the sea time after time”—they need our help. According to some estimates, 100 million sharks from a variety of species may be killed annually, mostly to feed China’s demand for shark fin soup, scientists say. Historically most fins have gone to southern China, where the soup is a popular wedding dish.Here are six sharks that don’t need to be fearsome to be fascinating.Bonnethead Shark  The bonnethead shark has something no other shark does — an appetite for leafy greens. Scientists recently discovered that seagrass can constitute as much as 50 percent of the bonnethead shark’s diet. (See: “This Shark Eats Grass, and No One Knows Why.”)The bonnethead is the smallest member of the hammerhead family and the only one with a rounded, spade-shaped head. These fish live in shallow seas and estuaries along the coasts of North and South America.The Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate, estimated between 300 to 500 years. (See: “272-Year-Old Shark Is Longest-Lived Vertebrate on Earth.”)Greenland sharks can be found in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, where they spend most of their time in the darkness, using their acute sense of smell to scavenge carcasses off the seafloor. These deep-sea dwellers have high levels of trimethylamine N-oxide in their tissues that enable them to withstand the immense pressure of the deep.One of the largest and slowest moving fish in the sea, the Greenland is similar in size to a great white, averaging about 21 feet long and weighing a ton. (See: “The Strange Quest to Catch a Massive Greenland Shark.”)Megamouth Shark  Little is known about these colossal filter feeders, because scientists have had little opportunity to study them. Less than a hundred megamouths have been observed since the species was discovered in 1976. These elusive creatures are believed to inhabit the deepest corners of all four oceans and feed exclusively on plankton.  The largest megamouth shark ever observed was an 18-foot-long male. However, female megamouth sharks are thought to be larger than males. Male megamouth sharks don’t reach sexual maturity until they are 13 feet long, whereas females don’t mature until they are 16 feet long, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.The appearance of the prickly shark is just about as strange as its name. This stubby, bottom-dwelling shark lacks an anal fin but possesses two dorsal fins positioned near the end of its tail. The aptly named prickly shark is covered in sharp dermal denticles, or “shark scales,” that protrude from its leathery skin like thorns on a rose stem.   Prickly sharks can be found in many parts of the Pacific Ocean, including Japan, Taiwan, and the U.S. West Coast. Even though these sharks live hundreds, sometimes thousands of feet below the surface, industrialized fishing still poses a threat to their survival. Deep-sea fishing fleets—using bottom-trawlers, gillnets, and longlines—frequently catch and kill prickly sharks by accident.The zebra shark may not be the fastest or smartest shark, but it’s arguably one of the cutest. Zebra sharks are born with brown and white bands that mildly resemble those of its namesake. Once it reaches maturity, the stripes are replaced by brown spots.Growing up to about eight feet long, zebra sharks feed primarily on mollusks, which they suck out of their shells using their muscular mouths. (See “Shark Surprises Aquarium With Rare ‘Virgin Birth.’”)The shortfin mako shark is the fastest shark in the seven seas. In short bursts, the mako can reach speeds up to 35 miles per hour. Mako sharks, which inhabit temperate and tropical seas worldwide, use their speed to ambush tuna, swordfish, squid, and other sharks. Makos use their jagged teeth to shred their victims’ fins so they can’t swim away.Mako sharks are also warm-blooded—a rare trait among sharks. This allows them to venture into depths and latitudes that are far too cold for other sharks.But the species can’t escape sport and commercial fishing, which has made it increasingly rare and classified it as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Every year, thousands of shortfin makos get caught on fishing gear that was set to catch a more desirable species.

"Underwater photographer Brian Skerry's first encounter with a female blue shark off the coast of Rhode Island over 30 years ago was a galvanizing moment. "I was entranced by her rich, indigo skin, while every sense in my body was on high alert, my heart racing as I moved closer," he says. "Drawing to within a couple of feet of each other, she barely acknowledged my presence and then vanished into the haze."  The spell has only grown stronger in the years since, and the more he understands these creatures, the more he wants to show them in a different light, as something we might respect and appreciate rather than revile and fear.  Skerry's latest stories for National Geographic magazine speak of the importance of these predators to our ecosystem and the dangers they face for survival. He's made 14 trips around the world to photograph tiger sharks, great whites, oceanic whitetips, and shortfin makos. Here, he shares the combination of passion, skill, and technique it takes to make these images. —National GeographicPhotographing wildlife within the ocean is quite unlike terrestrial photography. Undersea photographers can't use telephoto lenses to make pictures of animals in the distance. Even in the clearest of water, visibility is never that good, and water acts as a giant filter, removing color and refracting and scattering light.I cannot sit in a camouflaged blind for weeks waiting for an elusive animal to wander past or use wonderful tools such as camera traps. Instead I must dive underwater, where I can remain only as long as the air supply on my back will last, often less than an hour. I need to get close to my subjects, typically within a couple of meters.Imagine your subject is an apex predator, and the thought becomes especially daunting.Yet, while coming within a foot of a grizzly bear or lion with camera in hand would be crazy, I’ve done so many times with sharks. And in my experiences I've found most sharks to be rather shy and cautious. Getting one right in front of my lens is difficult and, more often than not, they swim away from me rather than toward me. In comparison with terrestrial predators, sharks seem … polite.Still, I believe in eliminating as many risks as possible and taking precautions to give myself the best chance of producing high-quality images while remaining safe.Working with some shark species I look like a medieval knight, donning a chain-mail suit of tiny, welded steel links as protection against a shark bite. I never need it, but it provides peace of mind, allowing me to concentrate on making pictures. I also built a pole cam system, essentially a camera on a stick, that I can use from the safety of the boat. Shark cages can be effective in places like southern Australia, where there are multiple, aggressive sharks, but they're also limiting. Many species won’t approach a cage, and even if they do the photographer is restricted in regards to composition.But to photograph great whites in the waters of Cape Cod, Massachusetts—where the unique white shark situation is analogous to a new pride of lions emerging in Africa—I had to try something completely different.Since 2009, great white sharks have been arriving off Cape Cod in increasing numbers. They come here during the summer months to feed on the growing population of gray seals, a species that was largely wiped out in the 1600s by sealers but whose stocks have been increasing since the Marine Mammal Protection Act was created in 1972.These sharks are completely wild and, unlike in other regions, don't seem interested in approaching boats even when bait is introduced. And the visibility in the water isn't good, with green, murky conditions being the norm.I was stumped at how to produce a photograph of a shark in this place.After trying a number of techniques, I finally tried placing cameras inside seal decoys. I had to determine the best position for the camera within the decoy, since I couldn’t move it once deployed. Real-time video was needed as well, in order to see when a shark was in the frame and I had to be able to trigger my camera wirelessly. Lastly, I wanted the shark to be curious but not too interested that it would attack the decoy—which would destroy my camera system.Working with a talented team of assistants and researchers we built equipment, found elusive sharks, and produced a series of images—including the first images of a great white shark in shallow, green Cape Cod waters.Watch a video of how Skerry got the shot.For the artist within me, sharks represent an endless well of inspiration, a blend of grace and power that lures me into the sea time after time in hopes of producing a new rendering that truly captures their essence.

And the hope that readers are compelled to appreciate and care about these animals.Brian Skerry has spent more than 10,000 hours underwater exploring the world’s oceans with a camera.

"A hammerhead shark is pulled aboard a fishing boat 500 miles off the coast of Indonesia. Its flesh is not worth much, but its fins could fetch $100 a pound. The fishermen grab the shark, slice off its fins, and throw the animal, still alive, back into the sea to sink to the ocean floor.According to some estimates, 100 million sharks from a variety of species may be killed annually, mostly to feed China’s demand for shark fin soup, scientists say. Historically most fins have gone to southern China, where the soup is a popular wedding dish. But an anti-fin campaign has emerged, using celebrities such as actor Jackie Chan and former NBA star Yao Ming.Some say this effort may have cut Asia’s shark fin demand by 70 percent. The Chinese government has outlawed shark fin soup at government events. But it’s not clear whether the wholesale slaughter of sharks has really slowed. Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly says the government action “is enough to eliminate finning from the radar of Western organizations. And it may continue under the radar until the last shark is caught.”",
"Hammerhead sharks are plentiful around Darwin Island, part of a new ocean sanctuary.A new sanctuary now protects the unique marine life around the Galápagos Islands, including the highest abundance of sharks known in the world.Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, announced creation of the marine sanctuary Monday, together with 21 smaller conservation areas scattered through the volcanic archipelago, protecting over 18,000 square miles (47,000 square kilometers), or about one third of the water around the Galápagos Islands (which Ecuador administers). The new sanctuary alone encompasses 15,000 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) and extends around the northern Galápagos islands of Darwin and Wolf.A World Heritage Site because of their unique biodiversity and inspiration for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, the Galápagos Islands already had 97 percent of their landmass protected as a national park. However, less than one percent of the surrounding water was fully protected. As a result, legal and illegal fishing have been taking a rising toll on wildlife over the past few years, says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence who led a Pristine Seas expedition to the area in December.But now, “Ecuador has shown tremendous leadership by protecting one of the most globally valuable places in the ocean,” says Sala, who heads the Pristine Seas project (which studies and helps protect wild ocean places).Fishing will no longer be allowed in the new sanctuary and conservation zones. Mining or oil drilling also won’t be allowed, although there hasn’t been recent interest from industry in the area.Upon creation of the sanctuary, Correa said, “The Galápagos Islands have extraordinary ecological value, and also economic value. The government of Ecuador supports the creation of a marine sanctuary to leave an inheritance to our children and our children's children; a wonderful world where as many species as possible are preserved for the enjoyment and knowledge of future generations.”A seal lion chases a school of Salema fish off Isabela Island in the Galápagos.The ocean off the Galápagos is an unusually productive ecosystem, thanks to the convergence of four major currents and upwelling of nutrient-rich waters, says Sala. The islands of Darwin and Wolf, in particular, contain a high abundance of sharks, from migratory hammerheads to reef sharks. (See photos of underwater animals off the islands.)According to a new study by Pelayo Salinas of the Charles Darwin Research Station, Sala, and colleagues, fish biomass there is on average 17.5 tons per hectare. That’s about twice as high as the second highest area known to science, the nearby Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica.Yet the diversity in the Galápagos has been under siege from pirate fishers, who often sell shark fins on the Asian black market. Sharks have shown declines in some areas of the islands, as have groupers and sea cucumbers, which have also been targeted.But in protecting the natural resource, “Ecuador has also protected a significant economic engine,” says Sala.Proving the point, a new study by the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project and the University of California, Santa Barbara found that each shark in the Galápagos is worth about $5.4 million over its lifetime, thanks to interest from the booming diving and tourism industry. A dead shark, in contrast, only fetches about $200 to the fishermen. Marine-based tourism supports more than a third of all jobs in the Galápagos Islands, bringing in $178 million per year.Darwin Island (background) and Darwin's Arch (foreground) are home to stunning biodiversity.Further, the large no-fishing zone will benefit the fishermen who will still be allowed to fish waters outside the sanctuary, says Sala. “We know that well enforced no-take zones result in spillover of fish that increases fishermen’s incomes,” he says.All this makes the new sanctuary a win-win, says Sala.Follow Brian Clark Howard on Twitter and Google+.",
"Marine biologist and conservationist Naomi Clark-Shen used to be petrified of the ocean. “From a very young age, I’ve been obsessed with animals,” she says. “But I was never that interested in marine life. I was scared of the dark murky areas that I couldn’t see. I had a big imagination and would psych myself out thinking about predators—sharks and crocodiles—coming to get me.”When her parents would take the family on snorkeling holidays in Malaysia, Clark-Shen would stay in the shallow sandy areas. All that changed when, at age 14, she saw a documentary about sharks in Costa Rica. She was mesmerized. “I watched hundreds of them swimming elegantly through the water. There was something so tranquil about it. From that moment, I knew I wanted to work with sharks,” she says. “My fear of the ocean slipped. I just became curious.”Clark-Shen got her diving license at age 16, and she is currently working on her Ph.D. on shark and ray fisheries and biology in Southeast Asia. Until 2020, she was a National Geographic Explorer running a shark research project partially funded by the National Geographic Society in Singapore.Each summer, sharks splash into our TV screens via programming like National Geographic’s SharkFest. Millions tune in to watch a great white shark leap out of the ocean to catch its prey midair or see a shiver of silky sharks surround scuba divers. People are wild about sharks, and for some, that interest has inspired efforts to seek up-close-and-personal experiences.Shark tourism is a thriving, multi-million-dollar industry. Enthusiasts can snorkel or scuba dive with them; witness their feeding habits; or encounter great white sharks while submerged in an underwater cage. Once reserved for professional divers and marine biologists, getting close to wild sharks—safely—is becoming an activity for the whole family. Here’s how responsible marine tourism can both inspire kids and help with conservation.“If we have the opportunity to take kids out and see a shark in the wild, they’ll see them in a different light,” says marine biologist Jillian Morris. “When kids see sharks behaving very differently than what they’ve been told their whole life, that’s the ‘aha’ moment. It gives them a connection to sharks which will stay with them their whole lives.”(Learn how to help kids get over their fear of sharks.)That connection and education are key to continuing conservation efforts, according to a study published in PLOS One, a peer-reviewed, open-access scientific journal by the Public Library of Science. When surveying 11- and 12-year-old students in Hong Kong, researchers found that they favored shark conservation when they were educated about their ecological significance in marine life and corrected about their misconceptions.“There’s so much misinformation out there about sharks,” says Morris, who started Sharks 4 Kids, an educational program in Bimini, in 2012. She had noticed a disconnect between tourists coming to the Bahamas—known as the shark-diving capital of the world—and residents, who stayed out of the water due to a culturally ingrained fear of sharks.“We want local students to get out and see why tourists travel, why film crews come, why scientists come from all over the world,” says Morris. “These kids are going to grow up and maintain the shark sanctuary. They’re going to work in tourism, and they’re going to vote. Having the community connected to conservation is when you have success.”After learning about sharks at aquariums, in classrooms, or on television, some children become avid ambassadors of sharks, enthusiastically reciting factoids and advocating for their protection. “Kids can influence their parents and the adults around them,” Morris says. “They’re far more powerful than they realize or people give them credit for.”As shark conservation continues to gain momentum, there are many things parents can do to cultivate their children’s curiosity about sharks.Not all sharks are created equal. Out of the nearly 500 species, only a dozen are considered dangerous to humans. A majority of deadly attacks are attributed to great white sharks, tiger sharks, and bull sharks. Still, while 2020 was one of the deadliest years for shark attacks in the last decade, only 10 people were killed worldwide. Statistically, you’re 100,000 times more likely to perish from a mosquito bite than a shark bite.“We are not part of their menu,” says Evans Baudin, owner of a diving company in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. “Sometimes, they can be curious and come close. But they’ll leave as soon as they realize we’re not food.”(Find out why sharks form years’ long “friendships” with each other.)Although sharks are resilient—they have survived at least four mass extinction events in the last 400 million years—the toothy fish are now at risk of being wiped out due to human activity. Millions of sharks are killed each year when they’re caught in commercial fishing nets or slaughtered for their prized fins—a delicacy in some Asian countries. Today, 71 percent of the world’s shark species are at risk of extinction.Marine biologist Caine Delacy is one of many scientists whose efforts to protect sharks are gaining traction. The hook? Combining conservation with tourism. “It’s a slow burn trying to convert people to like sharks,” says Delacy. As part of his shark conservation efforts, Delacy takes tourists on shark dives around the world from French Polynesia to Australia to Baja California. His goal is to show people that sharks aren’t mindless man-eaters but rather magnificent, ancient creatures vital to the ocean’s vulnerable ecosystem.In Belize’s warm Caribbean waters, tourists can swim with a shiver of six-foot-long nurse sharks in the Shark Ray Alley four miles south of San Pedro. While the region has an abundance of nurse and whale sharks—the only two protected shark species in Belize—the rest of the area’s sharks were fished out. “Tourists were coming to see nurse sharks, and they found out the locals were killing them in large numbers,” says marine biologist Carlee Jackson. “The government ended up protecting them specifically for tourism. The locals were terrified of sharks. Now they’re fine with nurse sharks because they bring in money.”Conservationists hope that tourism profits will incentivize countries to protect sharks. A pivot to a tourism-based economy means residents could rely on different sources of income. “The money you spend locally will mean people can feed their families with earnings derived from tourism, not fishing,” says Delacy.(This chart explains how quickly sharks are dying out worldwide.)Another way tourism can help shark conservation is via exposure and education. “Once people do a shark dive, they see how beautiful they are underwater and how they really have no interest in humans as food,” says Mickey Smith, an underwater videographer with a Florida shark-diving operation. “Then customers may start to care about sharks, help sign petitions, or help bring up bills to protect them.”Efforts to rehabilitate sharks’ reputation may be working in Smith’s state and around the world. Hawaii enacted a Shark Protect Act, which made the state a marine sanctuary for the more than 40 species of sharks that frequent the waters, while Florida recently banned the import, export, and sale of shark fins. In June, the U.S. Senate, in a rare bipartisan action, approved a similar bill.Shark tourism is not without controversy. One much-debated practice is “provisioning” or “chumming,” in which outfitters lure sharks with food. “I personally don’t think it’s a safe thing to do,” says Jackson. “Ecotourism is [about] having less of an impact on the environment, but when you’re feeding an animal, you’re having a direct impact on that animal, which indirectly has an impact on the environment.”(Explore why shark tourism in the Philippines is controversial.)Research has shown that when sharks are fed by humans, they will spend more time in the areas tourists frequent, rather than roaming around searching for natural food sources. Fishes that are normally their prey increase in abundance, which could have a cascading effect in the food chain.Some scientists also consider cage diving problematic. The practice submerges divers in locked cages while tour operators chum the water to lure predatory sharks like great whites. Critics believe that this encourages unnatural behavior in sharks and may lead them to swim too close to other humans or spur attacks.Another pressing concern is overtourism. Slow swimmers like whale sharks and nurse sharks could get hit by boats crowding the waters. Inexperienced divers might kick coral with their fins, causing irreparable reef damage.The desire to swim with sharks is multifaceted. “There are people who are trying to face their fears and want to do something out of their comfort zone,” Delacy says. “And there are the enthusiasts who just want to see as many sharks as they can. For them, it’s like birdwatching.”There are companies all over the world that allow families to snorkel or dive with sharks. Children as young as 10 can be certified in scuba diving. “Research and select the best option based on age and how much water experience your child has,” says Morris. For example, parents of children who are not strong swimmers can take them to wade in shallow waters surrounded by gentle nurse sharks at Compass Cay Marina in the Bahamas. Near Port Lincoln in South Australia, they can sit in a submerged glass pod to watch great whites weaving through the deep blue ocean.Many adventure outfitters offer photography and videography packages to document guests’ underwater experiences. Images of sharks, from a frenzy of hammerheads to toothy mako sharks, dominate social media. Chasing likes, some people stumble into questionable practices, like touching sharks.(Here’s a scientific explainer on why people are afraid of sharks.)Marine biologist Jackson agrees that kids can safely swim with sharks under proper supervision by an experienced adult. “For both children and adults, safety with sharks is usually dependent on your actions while in the water,” she says. “It’s safe if a child is old enough to learn how to respect sharks by keeping their distance.”For the least negative impact on both humans and sharks, Delacy says it’s important to stay out of their way and just quietly observe. “I want people to turn off from our crazy world and be amazed at what’s bigger and grander than you,” he says. “The amazing thing is someone having a really profound emotional connection to the environment and the animals.”Rachel Ng is a Hawaii-based travel writer.

"Many of us think of sharks as powerful, mysterious, and solitary as they glide through the deep. And no wonder, since the fish have long been portrayed in popular media as lone predators, appearing out of nowhere to attack.But that image has come under scrutiny in recent years, as shark researchers around the world have discovered the fish congregating in large numbers and interacting with others of their own species in ways that are decidedly friendly.Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine scientist at Florida International University, and his team used acoustic transmitters to record the interactions over four years of about 40 gray reef sharks around Palmyra Atoll, southwest of Hawaii. (Read about the most fascinating shark discoveries of the last decade.)Their study, published in 2020 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that reef sharks return to the same communities year after year, forming clear preferences for the company of certain other individuals, with some “friendships” that endured throughout the study.“We now know that sharks are capable of forming social associations with other individuals that last years,” says Papastamatiou, also a National Geographic Explorer. His team’s research will be highlighted in the episode “Shark Gangs,” premiering July 7 on National Geographic’s SharkFest. The sharks’ social associations may have lasted even longer, but the data was limited to the four-year battery life of the transmitters.Other research in the journal Scientific Reports has found complex social networks between sand tiger sharks along the eastern U.S, relationships once thought to be strictly the domain of higher-order mammals such as chimpanzees, says Danielle Haulsee, who led the study while at the University of Delaware.In her 2016 study, Haulsee and colleagues found that individual sharks tagged with recording devices had thousands of interactions with their peers, with some pairs spending up to four straight days together.The study also found certain sharks were unmistakably companions: These weren’t random associations, she says.You’re going to need a bigger screen. Tune in to the biggest SharkFest ever, spanning six weeks and airing across four networks and Disney+. The 9th annual SharkFest starts Monday, July 5, at 9/8c on National Geographic with the one-hour marquee doc special Shark Beach With Chris Hemsworth.The burgeoning research should put to rest stereotypes of sharks as robotic, man-killing machines, says Jasmin Graham, a marine biologist at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida.“For instance, this research on their personality and social lives shows they’re actually way more like us than we realized,” says Graham, who is also president and CEO of Minorities in Shark Science, a group dedicated to helping women of color break down the barriers necessary to enter the field.Teasing out why sharks socialize—and how much of their behavior is cooperative—is a challenge, but there are some clues, such as food availability and warmer waters due to a changing climate.Great white sharks, primarily juveniles, are showing up in record numbers along southern California beaches as the population has rebounded since 1994, when the species was protected by the state.Using drone footage as “spy satellites” and transmitter tags to track individual sharks, Chris Lowe, director of the Shark Lab at California State Long Beach, and his team identified 53 individual sharks between coastal San Diego and Santa Barbara in 2020.While great white sharks typically maintain distances of about 30 feet from each other and don’t seem too “buddy-buddy,” as Lowe puts it, they are clearly drawn together by a preference for the area.“We think it’s analogous to a playground or schoolyard—some are eating, some are just hanging out, some are trying to avoid the bullies,” Lowe says. “So the question is, Why do [shark] kids come to this playground, what draws them there?” (Read why great whites are still such a mystery to us.)He has some theories: Stingrays, their favorite food, are plentiful in the area. Staying close to shore provides protection from predators, such as bigger sharks. And as temperatures in the Pacific rise due to climate change, great whites are following the warming waters farther and farther north.Whether sharks join forces to hunt is harder to figure out, says Matt Smukall, director of the Bimini Shark Lab in the Bahamas’ Bimini Islands. For instance,  some species, such as bull sharks and blacktip sharks, will gather in the dozens when fish spawn en masse, sometimes appearing to corral their prey.“The question is, is this true cooperation, with the sharks deliberately working together to optimize hunting conditions?” Smukall says. “It could be that there’s this huge abundance of food and everyone turns up for the feast.”Either way, he says, the sharks win: “What’s good for one shark is good for the other sharks, and everybody’s success goes up."Favorable water currents may also be a reason why sharks assemble, Papastamatiou adds.In a new study published in July 2021, he documented a surprising behavior in gray reef sharks in French Polynesia: surfing. Hundreds of these perpetual swimmers were observed riding the waves together, giving them a chance to save energy—and even sleep.“We have been looking for explanations for why sharks gather in certain places, and this provides an answer,” Papastamatiou says. “These findings could also apply to other coastal areas, and possibly explain why sharks may prefer one area over another.”In some cases, there may not be an obvious purpose for shark camaraderie. At the Bimini Shark Lab, Smukall and his colleagues found that young lemon sharks sought out companionship of other sharks for no discernible reason. There’s growing evidence that lemon sharks have their own personalities, which may influence whether they spend time with other sharks, he adds.Baby lemon sharks observed in open-water pens in their native habitat demonstrated a range of social temperaments, with some gregarious animals engaging in frequent interactions while others remained more standoffish, preferring to stay by themselves.As in humans, those personality differences can play a role in success and even survival. For example, baby lemon sharks deemed to be more explorative in the pens and then tagged with recording devices were found to be bigger risk-takers in the wild as well, venturing farther to find food, which caused them to grow and mature faster, according to Smukall’s research.This adventurousness came at a price, though; the larger and faster sharks also had lower rates of survival since it made them more likely to encounter predators. (Read about a deep-sea shark bonanza seen off a remote island chain.)More would be known about the intimate lives of sharks if the field weren’t so new, due in part to a lack of funding and sharks’ negative reputation. “We’ve only had about 20 years to really start studying sharks,” says Lowe.Compounding that issue, shark populations continue to crash, due largely to overfishing. Sharks and rays have suffered a staggering 71 percent population decline since 1970, with reef sharks in particularly dire straits.But thanks to initiatives such as Minorities in Shark Science, shark science is expanding and diversifying in ways never thought possible, says Graham. (Learn about six sharks you’ve probably never heard of.)“I believe we’ll discover so much more about sharks in the coming years,” she says. “It’s exciting to think we’ll understand them better than we ever have before.”",
"Whale sharks (pictured, an animal feeding on plankton off the Yucatán Peninsula) can manipulate the flow of water to capture their preferred food.Bamboo sharks walk. Ninja lantern sharks glow in the dark. Whale sharks can carry up to 300 babies at once—at different fetal stages and from different fathers. Zebra sharks experience “virgin birth.”These are but a mere sampling of the decade’s most fascinating shark discoveries. Some 500 known species of these toothy fish ply our planet’s waters, ranging from bite size to bus size, and scientists are still becoming acquainted with most of them. Since 2000, when scientists discovered shark populations were collapsing around the world, research on sharks has ramped up across many fields of study, from paleontology to neuroscience to biomechanics.A quarter century later, one thing is clear: Sharks are not the senseless killers often portrayed in popular culture. For starters, these fish have large brains that range in relative size from species to species.“Your brain is like a shark’s,” says Kara Yopak, a comparative neuroanatomist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. In fact, as one of Earth’s most primitive creatures, sharks were first to evolve what she calls “the vertebrate brain blueprint,” which contains well-known structures such as olfactory bulbs, the cerebellum, and parts of the forebrain and midbrain.“The biggest misconception is that sharks are these preprogrammed, small-brained eating machines,” Yopak says. “I’ve learned that’s not the case.”As shark science expands, so does the urgency to protect the many species, two-thirds of which are threatened by overfishing, climate change, habitat loss, and poaching. One study suggests that if the world upped its marine protected areas by just 3 percent, it could potentially save 99 of the most imperiled sharks, many of which are top predators that help keep their ecosystems in balance. (Read about six sharks you’ve never heard of.)Here are more findings that have flipped our knowledge of sharks on its head.Researchers such as Barbara Block, a marine biologist at Stanford University, have been placing GPS tags on sharks and tracking their movements—and revealing their secret lives.Previously, scientists thought great white sharks near California stuck close to the shore, hunting sea lions and seals. But as tracking technology advanced, allowing scientists to tag the sharks for longer periods, Block and colleagues learned that the predators traveled thousands of miles each winter to a warm patch of water in the open Pacific, where they made unexplained nighttime dives.A great white swims off the Neptune Islands in southern Australia. Scientists once thought the predators hunted mostly close to home.Satellites had suggested this Colorado-size Pacific region, since dubbed the “white shark café,” was devoid of food. But they were wrong. Scientists found an area rich with shrimp, worms, big eye tuna, squid and various deep-sea creatures. Now that we know this white shark haunt is so crucial to their life cycle, conservationists are working to establish it as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.On the U.S. East Coast in recent years, a great white named Mary Lee has become a minor celebrity, beach-hopping among Bermuda, Florida, and the Jersey Shore and surprising scientists with her frequent jaunts. Mary Lee hasn’t appeared since 2017, but she has active accounts on Facebook and Twitter.Other shark species are less peripatetic, undertaking epic migrations. In 2014, a great white named Lydia became the first known of her species to cross the Atlantic Ocean. And in 2017, a whale shark named Anne broke records by traveling some 12,400 miles across the Pacific Ocean in a little over two years.All sharks are covered in hundreds of thousands of tiny denticles, which mysteriously regenerate when lost.“Each one of which is like one of your own teeth, with a pulp cavity, dentine, and enamel covering,” says George Lauder, a fish biologist and roboticist at Harvard University. “The teeth in our mouth come from ancient scales that covered animals like sharks probably 400 million years ago.”Recent advances in imaging technology, 3-D printing, and robotics have revealed how denticles help sharks swim. In laboratory experiments, Lauder found that sharkskin-like material moved faster and used less energy than smooth material.The secret? Denticles reduce drag and increase lift and thrust. Size also matters; smaller denticles increase speed, and larger ones decrease it. On individual sharks, denticle patterns and sizes can vary.Scientists once assumed all filter-feeding fish used their mouths like colanders: Anything too big to fit through the holes stuck; the rest went out with the water. But Erin “Misty” Paig-Tran, a functional anatomist at California State University, Fullerton, wondered how that could be true. Filter-feeding manta rays and whale sharks she studied near Cancún, Mexico, fed in the same place at the same time, but ate totally different things.By testing 3-D models of sharks and manta filters in the lab, she unveiled how they do it. By adjusting their swimming speed and the width of their mouths or gill slits, the fish can catch their preferred food by manipulating the water flowing through their gullets. Generally, the faster the water’s speed, the smaller the food particles they ingest. (Learn how the world’s biggest whale sharks are disappearing.)The filter-feeding species have different strategies. Whale sharks stop and suction feed, surface and gulp, or swim with open mouths. Megamouths take huge gulps with their denticle-covered filters. Basking sharks swim with open mouths.In 2007, scientists studying the diet of bonnethead sharks found bellies full of up to 60 percent seagrass.“Everyone sort of thought, myself included, that sharks were carnivores,” says Samantha Leigh, an animal physiologist at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Sure, they may have eaten seagrass by accident, but could their bodies do anything with all that green stuff?About a decade later, Leigh, then a graduate student at University of California Irvine, fed captive bonnethead sharks seagrass labeled with isotopic tracers—special molecules that allowed her to see where nutrients from the seagrass moved through the body. She found the fish digested about half the organic matter in the seagrass and incorporated its nutrients into their bodies.“That is very similar to what some juvenile sea turtles digest,” she says. It’s the first omnivorous diet ever seen in a shark. How they do it remains mysterious, but Leigh says the sharks may get help from microbes in their guts—just like humans.Studying denticles has enabled Harvard’s Lauder, for instance, to create aerodynamic underwater vehicles with surfaces that more efficiently move through water. (Read how shortfin mako scales could help build better planes.)In 2012, Lauder tested swimsuit material, purported to reduce drag like sharkskin, that 80 percent of winning swimmers at the Sydney Olympics wore. The Speedo LZR suits, now banned due to concerns over unfair advantage, boosted the swimmers’ performance by about 7 percent, he says. Swimsuit companies such as Speedo are working to design new suits to replace the LZR that are not considered “technology doping.”Lauder’s research found the suits actually weren’t reducing drag for human swimmers. “The surface of these suits is actually nothing like real sharkskin,” Lauder notes. The real key was that the tight, full-body suits smoothed out any bumps on human skin.California State University’s Paig-Tran says that filter-feeding sharks are inspiring designs for high-volume, energy-efficient, self-cleaning industrial filters for purposes like wastewater treatment, or even removing microplastics from water bodies.“There’s a lot that’s happened in the past 10 years,” says Paig-Tran. “The more we learn about sharks, the more fascinating they become.”",
"Mary Lee rests in a cradle before researchers affixed a tag to her dorsal fin in September 2012 near Cape Cod.It seems that Maryland and Virginia weren't enough of a draw for a certain great white shark named Mary Lee. The shark—whose travels have gone viral on the Internet—left those waters and was pinged off the southern tip of New Jersey at 8:15 a.m. Thursday.Scientists first tagged Mary Lee off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in September 2012. The 16-foot-long (4.9-meter) animal was one of five great white sharks fitted with a satellite tag by researchers to track the predators' movements. All five sharks got names, and Mary Lee was named for the mother of one of the researchers.One of Mary Lee's compatriots—Lydia—made history last year when she was the first great white observed to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean. It's likely that other great whites are swimming across the Atlantic too, Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries scientist at Massachusetts Marine Fisheries, said at the time. Lydia just happened to be the first that people were able to track. (Learn more about Lydia's transatlantic adventure.)Mary Lee is no slouch either. "Lydia is broader scale in terms of movement north and east," Skomal said, "but Mary Lee's been all over the map as well." The predator has traveled a total of 19,474 miles (31,340 kilometers) since she was tagged more than two and a half years ago.The shark's satellite tag is bolted to her dorsal fin and should last about four or five years. It's a real-time tracking device that sends location data to satellites every time the tag breaks the ocean's surface. The satellites send the data to researchers who can then track the animals.Mary Lee has surfaced at least five times today while just south of Cape May, New Jersey. Her track from May 3 to May 5 is a jumble of zigzags just offshore of the Virginia-Maryland border. It's anyone's guess where she'll pop up next.Boat captain Brett McBride with great white shark Mary Lee before she gets her satellite tag.It's not unusual to see great white sharks close to shore, said George Burgess, director of the Florida program for shark research at the Florida Museum of Natural History. In fact, great whites "spend more of their time near shore because that's where they do most of their feeding," he explained.Seals and sea lions are the preferred food for adult great whites, Burgess said, and those mammals need to haul themselves onto shore periodically to rest and warm up. So that's where the sharks go looking for them.The shark biologist can't say for sure what Mary Lee was doing when she was nosing around Maryland and Virginia. But Burgess added that great whites on the U.S. East Coast do show some seasonality to their movements."The sharks are snowbirds, and they come down to northeast Florida in the wintertime," he said. "We think the timing is probably tied to the arrival of right whales off of Florida," as the whales gather in this area to give birth."No doubt the white [sharks] are following those groups looking for the old and the young and the stragglers, and will take advantage of any that don't make it," Burgess said.Marine mammals of all ages may need to keep an eye out for more of these top predators. Recent research has shown that great whites are on the rebound off both the east and west coasts of the United States, thanks to federal and state protections put into place in the 1990s.

"Scientists get ready to attach a tracking tag to a great white shark nicknamed Lydia.Ever since researchers tagged a great white shark nicknamed Lydia off Jacksonville, Florida, in March 2013, they've been keeping a close eye on her. Their vigilance was rewarded this past weekend when the 14-foot (4.4-meter) fish became the first great white observed to cross the Atlantic Ocean.Researchers had suspected great whites could make such a journey, but none had previously been documented doing so, says Heidi Dewar, a fisheries research biologist with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service in La Jolla, California.Although great white sharks aren't the only aquatic species to make such long-distance trips, this discovery is changing the way researchers think about the iconic animals, from the ways in which their populations interact to potential conservation strategies.Lydia is now just east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge—an underwater mountain chain that threads north and south through the ocean—and is headed toward the U.K.'s Cornish coast. Researchers consider crossing the ridge to be the official point at which one passes into the eastern Atlantic.The shark now also holds the distinction of traveling the farthest of any known great white. So far, Lydia has swum about 20,000 miles (32,187 kilometers), including meanderings along the U.S. East Coast before she struck out for Europe. Ocearch, the organization that developed the method used to capture and tag the great white, displays a real-time track of the shark on its home page.This champion swimmer blew past the previous record holder, a female that swam from South Africa to western Australia and back—crossing the Indian Ocean both ways—for a total of 12,427 miles (20,000 kilometers) in 2004.After researchers return Lydia to the sea, her dorsal fin, tracking tag attached, pokes above the waves."We're really just starting out in the world of white sharks," says Greg Skomal, the senior fisheries scientist at Massachusetts Marine Fisheries who tagged Lydia. Tracking such huge predators wasn't feasible until recent advances in technology.Lydia's satellite tag transmits location data every time the unit, attached to her dorsal fin, rises above the ocean's surface. Previous tags, known as archival tags, stored all their information until researchers could retrieve the unit, download the data, and re-create the shark's track. (See "Shark Tagging & Tracking: Separating Fact From Fiction.")One Big Family?Scientists have traditionally considered great white populations in the Mediterranean and off the U.S. East Coast to be distinct. But they have also occasionally seen great whites off the coasts of Europe and the Azores (map), west of Portugal, says Skomal. Looking at data from sharks like Lydia, he says, "you start to think, this may all be one big population.""Indeed, that's what's panned out when they've looked at [transoceanic movement] in other species," he adds. There seems to be a single North Atlantic population of blue sharks, for example. "I think the same can be argued for the mako." (See "Record-Breaking Mako Shark Tips Off Conservation Debate.")It could very well be that other great white sharks journey across the Atlantic, Skomal says. Lydia just happens to be the first one researchers observed making the trip.Follow the FoodWhy did Lydia decide to head to Europe? Likely for the banquet at various stops along the way.On March 7, tracking data showed her swimming north along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. "She's not diving down to the ridge," Skomal says. She's just swimming above it like an animal walking along a fence.Lydia knows the feature's there, Skomal says, likely picking up on magnetic anomalies. But the area is also rich in feeding opportunities, which is probably why she spent time wandering above the underwater peaks.In the Pacific Ocean the long-distance movements of great whites are usually tied to food, says Peter Klimley, a great white shark expert at the University of California, Davis. Seal and sea lion colonies on the Farallon Islands, near San Francisco, and on Guadalupe Island, off Baja California, attract great whites from September through November. (See a video of a great white shark going after seals.)The sharks then swim out to the middle of the Pacific. Researchers are still trying to figure out what they do there, but the sharks then come back to the same coastal marine mammal colonies, Klimley explains.Return AppearanceAs to whether the U.S. East Coast will ever see Lydia again, Dewar thinks there's a good chance she'll return. "That seems to be the typical pattern for females," she says. They'll give birth, then they "go off and forage, and travel pretty wide distances for two years or so, and then they come back."But, Dewar cautions, "we don't have that many tags on large females, so there's always the potential to be surprised."I think it's really exciting that they're starting to get these kinds of tags out there so we can get this information," she says. "The large females are a really important part of the population, and until you know what's going on, it's hard to develop conservation strategies to protect them."Follow Jane J. Lee on Twitter.",
"Whale sharks in Western Australia are among the best studied populations in the world.You’d think finding something as big as a school bus would be a cinch.But large whale sharks—the biggest fish in the sea—seem to have vanished from the world’s oceans, scientists say.Until a decade ago, adult whale sharks measuring an awesome 43 to 49 feet (13 to 15 meters) plied warm waters from India to Belize.Today these biggest of the big are seen only in the eastern Pacific, a new study says. Animals elsewhere average a mere 23 feet (7 meters) and under, which are small fry too young to breed. (Read more about the incredible lives of whale sharks.)"Where are they?” marine ecologist Ana Sequeira of the University of Western Australia says of the big guys.“We urgently need to know. ... We need to have the big mums and big dads to keep the species going," says Sequiera, who led a new study about the phenomenon.But how whale sharks go about their business is a secret they keep to themselves.Researchers still don’t know basic facts about the fish, such as its global population or why whale sharks gather in groups, called “coastal aggregations,” in shallower waters. (Related: "Secrets of Whale Shark Migration Revealed.")Sequeira and her colleagues recently delved into the lives of whale sharks at western Australia's Ningaloo Reef, home to one of the world’s best-studied coastal groups.After reviewing decades of observation data, the team found a troubling trend: The biggest animal spotted on the reef in the mid-1990s was 43 feet (13 meters long), but only 33 feet (10 meters) in the early 2000s, and an even more modest 26 feet (8 meters) a half-decade ago. (See amazing pictures of whale sharks worldwide.)The average size of Ningaloo’s whale sharks also shrank. In the most recent study period, the animals averaged only 20 feet (6 meters) from snout to tip, the scientists report in this week’s Royal Society Open Science. That meant most of the sharks were just kids.A search of whale-shark data from other sites turned up similar data.Except for some big females recently recorded near the Galápagos and Mexico, most very large whale sharks were seen before 2008, the study found, and the sharks in coastal groups are mostly immature animals.Sweating the Small StuffSo why are they getting smaller?It's possible the slow-growing animals, which live about 80 years, haven’t recovered from overfishing. Whale sharks are protected from hunting by some countries.Or perhaps illegal or accidental kills are still jeopardizing the shark. In 2014, a nonprofit group provided evidence that a factory in southeastern China processes about 600 whale shark carcasses a year.There are alternate explanations. Maybe whale shark gatherings have a youthful bias because big adults prefer to roam the deep ocean, says  Eric Hoffmayer, a research fishery biologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (See "Biggest Whale Shark 'Swarm' Found.")Whale shark measurements from groups other than Ningaloo aren’t totally reliable, adds whale shark expert Simon Pierce, of the California-based Marine Megafauna Foundation.That makes it difficult to draw conclusions about whale sharks worldwide. Sequeira agrees: With the big kahunas MIA, it’s impossible to say whether the species—listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature—is in serious decline.But Pierce says other data from fisheries in Taiwan and mainland China suggest whale sharks have gotten smaller. And whale-shark sightings in several oceans have become less frequent.“Whale sharks are definitely in a lot of trouble,” he says by email. “That's a valid take-home message.”Follow Traci Watson on Facebook.",
"A new structure inspired by shark skin could improve the aerodynamic performance of planes, wind turbines, drones, and cars.With more than 400 million years of evolution behind them, sharks have adapted to move quickly through water. Shortfin makos are the fastest sharks in the ocean, clocking speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. Salmon sharks are the second speediest, at 50 miles per hour, and iconic great whites are third.The skin of sharks is lined with denticles, or small, tooth-like scales. These denticles have been the subject of aerodynamic inquiry since they were first studied in the 1980s, but reviews have been mixed on whether they reduce drag or not. So, a team of evolutionary biologists and engineers at Harvard University investigated.The researchers wanted to see how denticles on sharkskin made the fishes faster and teamed up with their colleagues at the University of South Carolina to look into it. Through several lab tests, they found that shark denticles not only reduce drag to help propel the animals forward, but they also increase lift. Outlined in a paper published February 6 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, the research could soon have implications for aerial vehicles like planes, drones, and wind turbines.The main components of speed are lift and thrust. Aerial vehicles need some sort of force to push them upward, and something keep them headed in that direction. Since sharks are naturally buoyant, their normal lift is lateral rather than skyward, says co-first author Mehdi Saadat."You can ultimately enhance your lift and reduce your drag, which in turn helps to improve the amount of energy you're consuming," says PhD student and co-first author August Domel.The denticles on makos have three raised ridges, like mini sharkskin tridents. The researchers used micro-CT scanning and 3-D printed the denticles onto an airfoil, or the aerodynamic cross-section of a wing. Airfoils can help planes, helicopters, and other aircraft be more efficient flyers.Then, the researchers put that airfoil in a water flow tank. They tested 20 different configurations, switching up the size of the denticles, the rows they were arranged in, and the positions of those rows. They found that shark denticles not only reduce drag, but they also increase lift. The structures create high-powered, low-profile vortex generators to help the swimmers quickly glide through water. Vortex generators, which—as the name suggests—are configurations that generate vortexes, can be found on cars and planes.The test could be scaled up for larger airfoils as well. Though specific configurations are outlined in the paper, the researchers say those denticle configurations could change depending on what airfoil they're affixed to."This study was a proof of concept that these designs could be used to greatly enhance the aerodynamics on an airfoil," Domel says. "You sort of have to play with the parameters for your specific application."Originally, the research team set out to investigate what effect denticles had on a shark's speed. But this information could also be used to in other aerodynamic applications. Denticle-like structures could be applied to airfoils on vehicles like planes, drones, wind turbines, and cars to make them more efficient movers."We wanted to understand what the function of these denticles [is]," says Saadat, who is also a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. "Through that process, we realized we can actually [make] that into an aerodynamic device."More research and testing will be needed to see how this technology develops in the future."Can we do better?" Saadat asks. "That comes with the process of optimization."In addition to their speed, makos are well-adapted, streamlined, open-water sharks. The sexually dimorphic species can grow longer than 6 feet and weigh more than a thousand pounds, and they have been recorded to swim more than 1,300 miles in a month. Makos also have large gills, keen eyes, and pronounced but non-serrated teeth.Saadat says sharks could provide a wide area for more bioinspired research. Already, Harvard's George Lauder, who was also involved in this study, has worked to 3-D print artificial shark skin."Nature," Domel says, "has had [a much larger] head start on the design process than humans have."Pacific angelshark.

"Meeting a great white shark in the wild is nothing like you expect it would be. At first glance it’s not the malevolent beast we’ve come to expect from a thousand TV shows. It’s portly, bordering on fat, like an overstuffed sausage. Flabby jowls tremble down its body when it opens its mouth, which otherwise is a chubby, slightly parted smirk. From the side, one of the world’s greatest predators is little more than a slack-jawed buffoon.It’s only when the underwater clown turns to face you that you understand why it’s the most feared animal on Earth. From the front its head is no longer soft and jowly but tapers to an arrow that draws its black eyes into a sinister-looking V. The bemused smile is gone, and all you see are rows of two-inch teeth capable of crunching down with almost two tons of force. Slowly, confidently, it approaches you. It turns its head, first to one side and then the other, evaluating you, deciding whether you’re worth its time. Then if you’re lucky, it turns away, becoming the buffoon again, and glides lazily into the gloom.There are more than 500 species of sharks, but in popular imagination there’s really only one. When Pixar needed an underwater villain for its animated film Finding Nemo, it didn’t look to the affable nurse shark or the aggressive bull shark. Not even the tiger shark, which would be more appropriate in Nemo’s coral-reef home. It was the great white shark—with its wide, toothy grin—that was plastered on thousands of movie billboards across the world.The great white shark is the ocean’s iconic fish, yet we know little about it—and much of what we think we know simply isn’t true. White sharks aren’t merciless hunters (if anything, attacks are cautious), they aren’t always loners, and they may be smarter than experts have thought. Even the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks famously mentioned in Jaws may have been perpetrated by a bull shark, not a great white.We don’t know for sure how long they live, how many months they gestate, when they reach maturity. No one has seen great whites mate or give birth. We don’t really know how many there are or where, exactly, they spend most of their lives. Imagine that a land animal the size of a pickup truck hunted along the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Scientists would know every detail of its mating habits, migrations, and behavior after observing it in zoos, research facilities, perhaps even circuses. But the rules are different underwater. Great whites appear and disappear at will, making it nearly impossible to follow them in deep water. They refuse to live behind glass—in captivity some have starved themselves or slammed their heads against walls. (Several aquariums have released them for their own safety or because they were attacking tank-mates.)Yet scientists today, using state-of-the-art technologies, may be on the verge of answering two of the most vexing mysteries: How many are there, and where do they go? Unraveling these mysteries could be critical to deciding how to protect ourselves from them and them from us. When we finally see the great white clearly from all angles, will the world’s most fearsome killer deserve our fear or our pity?A 24-foot fishing boat sits just off the southern tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on a perfect summer afternoon. The passengers—three scientists, two paying customers, two journalists, and the boat’s captain—lounge on the seats, looking off toward Nantucket. The voice of a spotter pilot flying 1,000 feet above breaks out over the radio in a sharp New England accent. “We’ve got a wicked nice shark over here to the south!”Fisheries biologist Greg Skomal perks up. He’s standing five feet off the bow on the pulpit, a fenced-in walkway resembling a pirate’s plank. If this were a Hollywood movie, he’d have a harpoon and a peg leg. Instead he carries a GoPro camera attached to a 10-foot pole. He grins like a little kid as the captain guns the engine.Before 2004 hardly anyone in modern times saw great white sharks in the waters off the East Coast. Occasionally one would appear near a beach or in a fishing net, but they were anomalies. Elsewhere, great whites congregate seasonally around five “hubs” or territories, including California’s coast down to Mexico’s Baja California, South Africa’s southern shores, and Australia’s southern coast, where they gather to feed on seals. But there’s been no hub on the East Coast, nor have there been many seals. Sharks here were wanderers without a home. Then, in 2004, a single female found her way into shallow inlets and shoals near Woods Hole, Massachusetts.For Skomal, who’d been tagging other sharks for 20 years, this was the chance of a lifetime—a great white in his own backyard. “I thought it was a fluke. This will never happen again,” he says with his broad, boyish grin under ruffled salt-and-pepper hair. Over the next two weeks Skomal and his colleagues followed the shark, which they named Gretel after the lost girl in the fairy tale, and affixed an electronic tracker on her. Tracking a white shark across the Atlantic Ocean offered a chance to solve so many riddles. But 45 minutes into the journey, Gretel’s tag malfunctioned and popped off. “I went from this superhigh to this really deep low, because I was convinced that this was the shot in my career to study a white shark,” Skomal says.It wasn’t. Over the next few years he thought a lot about Gretel and wondered whether she was indeed alone. Then, on Labor Day, 2009, everything changed. A pilot saw five great whites off the cape. Over that weekend Skomal tagged them all. “I absolutely freaked out. My adrenaline was pumping. My heart—I could feel it just pounding in my chest. This was everything I was dreaming of.”White sharks have returned every summer since, leading some to call Cape Cod the sixth hub. How many great whites are there? For that we turn to the hub running from California to Baja California. The effort to count sharks there was pioneered by Scot Anderson while he was a volunteer seabird scientist in the mid-1980s on an island west of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Anderson and others have tracked the sharks—at first by sight, then by acoustic tags, and most recently with satellites. During the past 30 years, teams have assembled thousands of observations of individual sharks recognized by the shape and marks of their dorsal fins, while others have used the distinctive line between their gray bodies and white underbellies. Scientists know where the sharks congregate and how they feed. And each year most sharks they see are the ones they saw in previous years.This raised an intriguing question: With enough observations, could you use the sharks you see to estimate how many you can’t see? In 2011 a team in California did just that and came up with just 219 adults in California’s most shark-rich region. Even among top predators, generally less abundant than their prey, that’s a tiny number. The study shocked the public and came under immediate attack from other experts.Of course, counting great whites is a lot harder than counting land animals or even marine mammals. So scientists make massive assumptions about shark movements and then extrapolate. In California the biggest assumption was that a few feeding grounds were representative of the entire hub. Other teams crunched the same data using different assumptions, and one study estimated about 10 times more sharks. (That count was bolstered by adding juveniles, which the first excluded because so little is known about them.) Pretty soon scientists began quantifying white sharks in the other hubs. A team in South Africa estimated the population there at around 900, while another team put Mexico’s Guadalupe Island population, part of the California hub, at just 120 or so.Are these large numbers or small? Are great whites thriving or dwindling? The world has about 4,000 tigers and 25,000 African lions. Using the lowest estimates, global great white numbers resemble the estimate for tigers, an endangered species. Using the highest estimate, the population is closer to that of the lions, which are classified as vulnerable. Several experts see them heading toward extinction; others see a positive trend. Some say rising seal populations are a sign that great whites are nearly gone, while others say more seals mean more sharks. Aaron MacNeil, an Australian statistician who crunches shark data, says the appearance of sharks around Cape Cod and the increased activity in the Southern Hemisphere suggest the latter. “I haven’t seen any evidence in the last decade that white sharks are declining,” says MacNeil. “Yes, there is a historical depletion of white sharks. But the story is not that they are going extinct. The story is that they are probably increasing very, very slowly.”There’s reason to be hopeful. Few if any fishermen target great whites today, yet a global pact, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, gives white sharks its second strongest conservation rating because fishermen catch them unintentionally. With numbers so low, even accidental catches can play havoc with the species, which, as a top predator, has an ecologically important role in managing the oceans.To understand whether great white sharks need our protection, we must know not only how many there are but also where they go. Their migrations aren’t neat, like a bird’s or a butterfly’s. They’re messy, with one hugging the coast while another zigzags hundreds of miles out to sea. Many, but not all, seem to seasonally move between warm and cold water. And the paths seem different for males, females, and juveniles.Today, with long-term, long-distance tags that can communicate via satellite, scientists are finally getting some clarity. For years scientists have noticed that adult great whites in California and Mexico quit the coast in late fall. Now we know where they go: deep water in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Why they visit this great white shark “café” remains unclear. “I call it Burning Man for white sharks,” says Salvador Jorgensen, a biologist who studies factors that drive great white migration and ecology. “They are heading out to what some people call the desert of the ocean, and what the hell are they doing out there?”One possible answer is mating, which might explain why no one has ever observed it. The area is roughly the size of California and thousands of feet deep, which makes it hard to monitor sharks there. But satellite tags tell us that the females swim predictable straight patterns while the males swim up and down in the water column, possibly searching for mates. Thus a rough sketch of the lives of California white sharks is forming. After spending the summer and fall gorging on seals, they head out to the deep ocean to breed, relying on energy stores to live. The males then swim back to the coast while the females wander to unknown places, where they remain for another year or so, perhaps to birth their young. Newborn sharks then show up at feeding grounds—say, the waters off Southern California—devouring fish until they are big enough to join their elders in the north or south hunting seals.It’s not a perfect picture. Females and males aren’t in the café together for long, and we don’t know where the babies are born. But it explains a lot. For example, as a population rebounds, its young become plentiful, which is likely why Southern Californians have encountered a lot of sharks lately. Yet it’s tougher to figure out elsewhere. Australian sharks forage along the southern coast but don’t seem to have a pattern or café. And in the Atlantic we know even less. “We’ve got wanderers, and we’ve got coastal sharks. And what dictates which, I have no idea,” Skomal says.Even though he doesn’t understand their migrations yet, Skomal is sure that white sharks have a long history here. At his office in New Bedford, just west of Cape Cod, he opens a document that compiled studies of seal bones from Native American archaeological sites along the eastern seaboard. The discarded bones suggest that seal populations crashed from overhunting perhaps a century before the Declaration of Independence. In other words, we’ve had very few Atlantic gray seals throughout the United States’ 240-year history. Today, thanks to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, seal colonies now populate New England. And when the seals returned, the sharks came home as well.One bright August morning I board a two-seater plane with Wayne Davis, a veteran spotter pilot for tuna and swordfish who now helps scientists track down white sharks. Unlike the hubs, the water here is so shallow that sharp eyes can spot them from the air. In just 30 minutes of flying we see seven, all patrolling beaches where gray seals are foraging in open waters. On the way back Davis and I fly past several beaches a mile or so to the north packed with vacationers.So far locals have embraced their new neighbors. There are stuffed animals, T-shirts, posters, and a community art exhibit called “Sharks in the Park.” Even the new high school’s mascot is a great white. Most of the time the sharks are shown from the side—cheerful, buffoonish. Experts warn, though, that at some point someone here will meet the other version—the one with teeth.Attacks on people are incredibly rare. In waters off California, the chances of a surfer being bitten by a great white shark are one in 17 million; for swimmers, it’s even rarer—one attack in every 738 million beach visits, according to a recent Stanford University study. On Cape Cod, fatalities may not be a question of if, but when. The last lethal shark attack off New England was in 1936, but there have been several close calls recently. A swimmer there was bitten on both legs in 2012, and two paddlers in Plymouth were knocked from their kayaks in 2014, although they escaped unscathed.If a more serious attack happens, Massachusetts will join the other hubs in weighing the benefits versus the dangers of sharks in their waters.It may be that great white sharks are rebounding across the world: following the bigger seal and sea lion populations, re-establishing themselves in their old hunting grounds, reclaiming the coasts they nearly lost.Then again, it may be that great whites today are hanging over the abyss of extinction, clutching the edge by the skin of their jagged teeth. Will we look past our fear and reach out a hand to this creature? Can we take pity on the pitiless eyes of a monster?",
"North Atlantic OceanA tornado of silver horse mackerel and orange boarfish swirls around the submersible as it sits on the seafloor, 770 feet below the surface off the Azores archipelago.Inside, marine scientists Jorge Fontes and Melissa Cristina Márquez, as well as submersible pilot Lee Frey, are waiting patiently, eating chocolate and making small talk. Through this torrent of fish, they’re hoping to catch a glimpse of the deep sea’s largest predator—the bluntnose sixgill shark.Then, to their utter delight, a massive figure emerges from the darkness and approaches the submersible: an 18-foot female, the first sighting of the expedition.Sixgill sharks, three species of which live worldwide, are unlike any other. As their name implies, they have six gills instead of the usual five. The ancient creatures—which sport olive-brown skin, tiny dorsal fins, and haunting emerald eyes—also haven’t changed much since they shared the planet with T-rex and other dinosaurs.Intriguing as they are, scientists still know very little about these apex predators of the deep sea. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the bluntnose sixgill as near-threatened, though data is extremely scarce. This is largely due to the fact that studying these sharks is not easy: Scientists can catch them with nets and hooks and pull them up to the surface, but the experience can be traumatic for the animals.But in 2019 scientists from Florida State University, the Florida Museum of Natural History, the Cape Eleuthera Institute, and OceanX—an ocean exploration and media initiative established by Ray Dalio and his son Mark Dalio—found a better way to study these sharks: by tagging them where they live, hundreds of feet below the surface. OceanX provided a submersible outfitted with a pair of spear guns modified to inject a satellite tag into the shark’s thick skin. After much trial and error, the team attached a tag onto a bluntnose sixgill in the Bahamas.The success of the Bahamas expedition energized sixgill research. On June 3 an OceanX team on their research vessel, OceanXplorer, embarked on an expedition off the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean, working with local scientists to attach satellite and camera tags to the large population of bluntnose sixgills that live among the underwater canyons and seamounts surrounding the islands. (Read about six sharks you’ve likely never heard of.)“We really are just scratching the surface with what we actually know about sixgill sharks,” says Márquez, a marine biologist at Curtin University in Western Australia. “So attaching [more tags in the Azores] is going to shed some light on these animals that really rule that part of our oceans.”The sixgill research will be featured in the six-part National Geographic series OceanXplorers, executive produced by James Cameron, BBC Studios' Natural History Unit, and OceanX.And so far, the expedition has spotted many more sixgills than expected, Fontes says.“Previously, when we were fishing these animals for deploying tags, we would essentially have one or two animals per night, but here we've been having 10, 11 encounters per night,” he says. “This suggests this particular ecosystem is healthy.”To track sixgills, scientists onboard OceanXplorer—a 286-foot-long former oil drilling support vessel—have at their disposal two submersibles, a remotely operated vehicle, and a research vessel outfitted with equipment that can scan the water column and map the seabed. (Get an intimate look inside OceanXplorer.)Their goal during the week-long expedition is to outfit as many bluntnose sixgill sharks as they can with two types of tags. One is a satellite tag with a nine-month life span that will document the shark’s vertical movements, and the other is a camera tag that can not only film the shark over an eight-to-12-hour period but also track its location, speed, depth, and surrounding temperature.Pacific angelshark. Santa Catalina Island, CaliforniaBoth tags will be attached to the tips of spear guns mounted on the front of the science submersible. Because sixgill sharks have very thick skin, attaching tags to them in this way is minimally invasive.Perhaps one of the most mystifying behaviors of sixgills is their visits to shallow waters, despite the fact they spend most of their time at depths of up to 4,500 feet.Off the Azores, just over 800 miles west of Portugal, sixgills likely come to the shallows to feed, but they prefer to spend their time in deep water, where temperatures are cooler, says Fontes, at the University of Azores. (See nine photos of deep-sea creatures.)With the Atlantic Ocean projected to warm by at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050, it’s possible that sixgills won’t be able to tolerate water temperatures in the shallows, hindering their ability to feed, says Fontes, who’s studied sharks for over 15 years.“It will be very interesting to analyze the data that we get from these tags, because we’ll be able to compare it with data from colleagues that we are collaborating with from other parts of the world,” Fontes says.Doing so “will potentially allow us to understand what impacts climate change and ocean warming might have on the distribution of these animals, and eventually their prey.”So far, the OceanX Azores team is thrilled with the number of sharks they’ve encountered. The fact that sixgills thrive in the Azores is no coincidence, says Pedro Afonso, who also studies sharks at the University of Azores.Fishing in the region has always been small-scale, and the European Union banned deep-sea shark fishing in 2012, he says. “That’s why you can put a sub down here and see a dozen sharks.”David Ebert, director of the Pacific Shark Research Center at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California, says he’s looking forward to seeing how the movement patterns of Azores sixgills compares with those of sixgills in other parts of the world.In recent years, scientists have collected data on sixgill sharks in Hawaii, the Bahamas, and the Gulf of Mexico, which has enabled them to compare the vertical distributions of these sharks in different latitudes.“Tagging a single shark is not really going to tell you much, except for what that one particular shark does over a period of time,” says Ebert, who is not involved in the OceanX effort.“However, the cumulation of a number of tagged sharks can tell you a lot about their movements and behavior.”  (Take the quiz: How much do you know about the deep sea?)Back in the submersible, Fontes and Márquez are getting ready to return to the surface.They saw seven sixgill sharks, two kitefin sharks, and two tope sharks over the course of six hours—an impressive feat, even for scientists with a submarine. They hadn’t managed to tag any sharks on that dive, but they had many more nights ahead to try again.“It was a bit surreal,” says Márquez, “getting to sit back and see the life down there behaving naturally. It was such a privilege.”",
"In 2016, Ray Dalio, an investment fund manager, bought a ship designed to sturvey the ocean floor to search for oil. Now, as part of his OceanX initiative, the vessel is making its debut as one of the most decked-out venues for advancing our understanding of the deep sea.Unveiled this week in a new video provided exclusively to National Geographic, the OceanXplorer has been retrofitted over the past four years to double as a cutting-edge research center and a media production studio. The 286-foot-long ship has been modified to house a helicopter landing pad and climate-controlled hangar, a 40-ton crane, three submersibles, onboard DNA sequencing, and other scientific gear. In addition, the ship will have the ability to take high-quality images at unprecedented depths. An underwater modem will allow these images to be livestreamed around the world from thousands of feet under the sea.“The ship OceanXplorer will take ocean explorers to never-before-seen undersea worlds and allow them to beam back what they encounter via social media, digital experiences, and a TV show,” Dalio says in a news release. “It will be mind-blowing.”The hope is that the OceanXplorer will bring together scientific experts and talented storytellers to make the case as Dalio puts it, “that ocean exploration is both more important and more exciting than space exploration.”Fresh from a field test in Norway, the vessel is currently in the Red Sea off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula. There, the crew is preparing for an inaugural mission to study so-called super corals, which have the ability to recover and successfully reproduce after severe stress caused by phenomena such as ocean warming.In an upcoming National Geographic series, National Geographic Explorer-at-Large James Cameron and filmmakers with BBC Studios will follow the OceanXplorer and its crew around the world as they study different parts of the ocean. “It’s going to enable me, other filmmakers, scientists, explorers, to just get out there and find things that we truly don’t know are there yet,” Orla Doherty, executive producer of BBC Studios, says in a video that was released earlier this year, which was also produced by Dalio’s ocean exploration initiative.",
"The great hammerhead shark (pictured, an animal swimming off the Bahamas) is critically endangered.On the high seas, far from any continent, sharks and rays were once abundant. Shortfin makos, the fastest sharks on the planet, chased after their prey at speeds of over 20 miles an hour. Scalloped hammerheads plied the waters, scanning the ocean expanse for food with their wide-set eyes and other specialized sensory organs.These animals traveled widely across open waters so vast and inaccessible that many fishermen, and even some biologists, found it hard to believe that overfishing would ever endanger them.“A decade ago,” recalls Nicholas Dulvy, co-chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Shark Specialist Group, “we would have extremely heated debates about listing an oceanic shark as threatened.”Now, a sweeping analysis of current and historic population numbers have created a clearer—and sobering—picture. Dulvy and co-author Nathan Pacoureau, both at Simon Fraser University in Canada, found that populations of 18 shark and ray species have declined by 70 percent since 1970, according to the study, published in the journal Nature this week. At this rate, many of the species might disappear entirely in a decade or two, the authors caution. (Read about the most fascinating shark discoveries of the last decade.)When the research team crunched the numbers for the oceanic whitetip shark, a species that was common back in 1970, we “just looked at them in stunned silence,” Dulvy says.The oceanic whitetip “had declined by 98 percent in the last 60 years. That pattern was consistent across all three oceans.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature now lists the species as critically endangered.Scalloped and great hammerhead sharks have met a similar fate. Though fisheries rarely target oceanic sharks, if they're caught, their meat, fins, gill plates, and liver oil is often sold.This is troubling news both for the sharks and ocean health, as these top predators play a crucial role in the food web, in part by keeping smaller predators in check, experts say.A purse seine net encircles fish on Iturup Island in Russia's Far East. This fishing technique often captures sharks as well.For the study, Dulvy and Pacoureau collected all the data on those 18 species they could find across the globe, much of it buried in government reports or collecting dust on old hard drives.A growing public awareness of shark conservation has prompted fisheries management agencies to start collecting shark data, providing the team with an influx of brand-new information.The scientists ended up with 900 datasets spanning 1905 to 2018, each representing a species’ population changes over time within a particular region. With the help of international experts and computer modeling, the team extrapolated these data into best estimate of the global change in abundance. (Read more about sharks, lords of the sea.)They also took into account the development of open-ocean fishing techniques. Long lines studded with hundreds of hooks or enormous purse seine nets often accidentally ensnare sharks, and their use has doubled in the last half century, while the number of oceanic sharks caught in them has approximately tripled.“Combined with the increasing rarity of sharks, this means that the chance for an individual shark to get caught is now 18 times higher than it was in 1970,” says Dulvy.Dulvy adds that uncertainty is inevitable in his analysis, and that the authors have likely underestimated some of the species’ declines, particularly in areas where overfishing has occurred for many decades.The biggest decrease occurred in shark and ray populations in the tropics, where offshore fisheries have expanded in recent decades.As larger sharks and rays become rare, fisheries are pivoting toward smaller species, says co-author Holly Kindsvater, a population biologist at Virginia Tech who has studied several species of devil rays, some populations of which may have fallen by 85 percent in the past 15 years.Though people do eat their meat, their gill plates have recently become more popular in Chinese medicine. This shift shows how fishermen can pivot to other species when their original prey becomes scarce, she says. (Read how reef sharks are also in big trouble worldwide.)“I don’t think there are many boats on the high seas exclusively targeting sharks and rays. But if you’ve started out fishing for tuna, and you’ve overfished them, you’ll start catching other things, and you’ll find a way to sell those, as well.”The impact of overfishing, accidental or otherwise, on sharks should motivate governments to impose more regulations, with the goal of making fisheries sustainable, Dulvy says. It's also important, he adds, to limit the international trade of threatened shark and ray species.But there’s a long way to go. A proposed ban on fishing of endangered shortfin makos in the North Atlantic was recently blocked by the European Union and the United States, in part because the bulk of the catch is by Spain, says Dulvy.“Sharks are kind of the last unregulated area,” he says, “which I think is why there is a bit of resistance to managing them.”Such a ban has been shown to work for other species, says David Sims, a biologist at the U.K.’s University of Southampton who was not involved in this study. Sims has published research showing hopeful signs of recovery for great white sharks and porbeagles in the northwestern Atlantic, both of which are protected from fishing. (Learn about six sharks you’ve probably never heard of.)Other solutions include creating marine reserves or setting aside no-fishing zones in shark-rich hot spots, Sims says.Jessica Cramp, founder of the marine research and conservation organization Sharks Pacific and a National Geographic Explorer, agrees. She has helped establish several protected areas and a shark sanctuary in the Cook Islands to benefit migratory species, including sharks.“These may offer refuge for species like the oceanic whitetip and silky shark,” she says, ”which this study has confirmed are in big trouble.”",
"Several conservation groups—Sea Legacy, Turtle Island Restoration Network, Sharkwater, and Mercy for Animals—recently released a video clip (above) showing the impact fishing drift nets can have on marine life.Officially labeled drift gillnets, the large nets are used by industrial fishing operations in some parts of the world. In the U.S., they are only used in the California driftnet fishery, which stretches from Los Angeles to the northern tip of the state.Drift nets hang like walls in the ocean. They're made of a patchwork of fishing line that extends as much as 100 feet deep and a mile long. They tend to kill indiscriminately, meaning they can catch and entrap whatever tries to pass through. The result is often high amounts of bycatch, or sea creatures caught by fishers unintentionally.The California driftnet fishery targets swordfish and common thresher shark. But many other species are being impacted, conservationists say.A 2016 report by the Turtle Island Restoration Network looked at bycatch from the fishery for the decade prior. They found that 22 critically endangered turtles, 900 marine mammals (like dolphins and whales), and 26,000 sharks were killed as a byproduct of deploying drift nets.Santa Catalina Island, CaliforniaAccording to Cassie Burdyshaw from the Turtle Island Restoration Network, 60 percent of the fishery's total haul is discarded as unwanted.“It's really disappointing that we can know how harmful something is and turn the other way,” she adds.Sea Legacy co-founder Paul Nicklen is not content using facts and figures to illustrate a story. As a biologist-turned-photographer, Nicklen has been a frequent contributor to National Geographic, traveling the world to photograph wildlife.When an ocean sunfish or mola, a large fish that resembles a plate, was caught in a drift net earlier this year, Nicklen was there with Brock Cahill from Sharkwater to photograph it.“I've seen the good and the bad in the world, and this was one of the hardest things I've had to witness,” says Nicklen. “This makes no sense at all.”His photos show the mola rendered immobile. And while the fish isn't known for being the most nimble swimmer, the nets have captured more agile sea creatures, most of which die or become severely injured.The full video released by the four organizations shows “undercover” footage obtained by Mercy for Animals. They declined to divulge many details on how they obtained it. But they said they went undercover from December 2016 to December 2017, on two different ships owned by two different companies that fish in waters off the coast of Santa Barbara.“Consumers have a right to know how the fish [we eat] are treated,” says Lindsay Wolfe, a representative from Mercy for Animals. “[The video] is about helping get the information out.”Previously, the organization has taken covert video from inside factory farms to expose what they say are inhumane treatment of animals.The new video shows dolphins, sea birds, sharks, and stingrays all brought aboard fishing boats after getting tangled in gear.The group's dramatic video is punctuated by the image of a seal caught in a drift net. Nicklen says this photo was taken by an underwater photographer in 1983. It was included in the video compilation because it underscores how long drift nets have been harmful for protected marine species, he says.In response to inquiries, the National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Law Enforcement said they were aware of the footage and are conducting an investigation. No additional comment was given. National Geographic reached out to the California Fisheries and Seafood Institute, a trade group, but they declined to comment.The video was not released in a political vacuum. Turtle Island Restoration Network, which often works on environmental policy, hopes the video will persuade California constituents to support recently proposed Senate Bill (SB) 1017. That would require more observers to be aboard industrial fishing vessels.Observers look for legal compliance and log bycatch. According to NOAA's own records, observers are able to log only an estimated 20 percent of bycatch in the fishery, because they can't be on all boats at all times. Because they fall under NOAA, observers are funded by the federal government.Fishing with driftnets is not permitted by Oregon or Washington and is banned on the high seas by the United Nations. California is the last remaining state to allow the fishing practice.Conservationists counter that the nets could have serious longterm consequences on the health of California's marine ecosystems.As for Nicklen, he hopes his photos will speak for themselves: “Let the world decide if they find it acceptable or not.”",
"A grey reef shark, seen here in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, is one of the species that was missing from parts of its native habitat.Sharks are already in serious trouble worldwide, largely because of overfishing, but a new study shows they’re even worse off than previously thought.In a sweeping survey of 371 reefs across 58 countries, from the Central Pacific to the Bahamas, scientists discovered that about 20 percent were devoid of sharks. As essential apex predators, sharks help keep fish populations healthy by eating sick individuals and preventing prey numbers from exploding.Some of the reefs with the most depleted shark numbers were closer to human populations, such as Qatar, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Sri Lanka, and Guam.Blacktip reef sharks swim near Kirabati in the Pacific Ocean.The research, published today in Nature and part of the Global FinPrint Project, “is the largest reef shark study ever,” says study co-author Enric Sala, a National Geographic Society Explorer-in-Residence.Aaron MacNeil, a biologist at Dalhousie University, and colleagues set out more than 15,000 baited camera traps, and the local snapshots provided by each revealed that species such as grey reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, and Caribbean reef sharks were often missing from reefs in which they historically lived.“Having dived in hundreds of places around the world, from pristine to degraded, it was no surprise that a fifth of the reefs surveyed had no sharks,” says Sala, who founded the Pristine Seas initiative in 2008 to conserve the world’s oceans. (Read how the world’s coral reefs are dying.)And even in places where reef sharks can still be found, Sala adds, their numbers have been so reduced that they’re no longer playing the same ecological roles as predators.Caribbean reef sharks, once the most plentiful reef shark in the region, have declined in recent decades.Nick Graham, a marine biologist at Lancaster University in the U.K. who was not involved with the research, notes that while the camera-trapping approach “is tried and tested at local scales, this study has effectively coordinated a global assessment.”“Sharks are easily overfished,” Graham agrees, calling them “a rare occurrence when diving in many nations.”Two-thirds of the world’s 500 shark species are threatened by overfishing, often to meet demand for shark meat and fins, while nets and longline fishing equipment that unintentionally trap sharks have also severely diminished their numbers.But there is still some hope for sharks. “The good news is that if we fully protect areas from fishing, marine life and sharks can bounce back,” Sala says. Protecting the waters around Cabo Pulmo, Mexico, for instance, has restored rich underwater communities, complete with sharks. (Read more about sharks, lords of the sea.)Bringing back healthy shark populations isn’t just about creating space for the animals to recover—fisheries management is also key, such as imposing catch limits and limiting fishing gear that harms sharks. The new study, Graham says, “highlights the importance” of these approaches.By more carefully regulating how sharks are fished and reducing the number of sharks caught accidentally as bycatch, populations will have more of a chance to recover, he adds.Communication and outreach also has a critical role to play, says Nova Southeastern University shark researcher Carlee Jackson. “Many countries do partake in shark meat extremely regularly, but it’s never ok to tell those countries they’re doing something wrong," Jackson says.Instead, helping people around the world understand how important sharks are to the health of the oceans is a critical step. And part of that process may involve switching from fishing to ecotourism centered around sharks and the reefs they call home.“This is good for local people too because they can sell sharks to diving tourists many times over,” Sala says, “whereas you can only sell a dead shark once.”",
"The coral reefs around Fiji cover 3,800 square miles and face threats from climate change, overfishing, and pollution.The world’s coral reefs do more for the planet than provide underwater beauty.They buffer shorelines from the effects of hurricanes. An estimated 500 million people earn their livelihoods from the fishing stocks and tourism opportunities reefs provide. The tiny animals that give rise to reefs are even offering hope for new drugs to treat cancer and other diseases.Despite their importance, warming waters, pollution, ocean acidification, overfishing, and physical destruction are killing coral reefs around the world. Schemes to save those reefs are as creative as they are varied; most recently, scientists released data showing that marine protected areas can help save reefs if they are placed in just the right spots. Genetics is also becoming a larger area of coral research, giving scientists hope they might one day restore reefs with more heat tolerant coral.But now, in the lead-up to World Oceans Day on June 8, scientists caution that these and other strategies may only buy reefs time until world leaders implement aggressive climate change action.Without a mix of long-term cuts in emissions and short-term innovation, there’s a not-so-far-off future where coral reefs as we know them simply cease to exist, says Anne Cohen, a coral expert at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.Scientists often compare coral reefs to underwater rainforests, yet unlike the leafy plant base of a forest, corals are animals. The soft polyps inside the hard parts of corals are naturally translucent and get their famously vibrant color from algae living inside them.When corals experience stress from hot temperatures or pollution, they end their symbiotic relationship with this algae, typically expelling them and turning white, though one recent study indicates some coral turn a bright neon color when stressed. Coral are still alive when they bleach, but they’re at risk—essentially immunocompromised—and many eventually starve and die, turning a dark brown.People first noticed coral bleaching events in the 1980s. The problem intensified in 2016, when an El Niño weather pattern, which causes warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean, mixed with an already unseasonably warm ocean and killed off a third of the corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Since then, roughly half the corals on Australia’s famous reef have died in subsequent bleaching events, jeopardizing an underwater landscape 1,500 miles long.Scientists around the world are looking for all kinds of ways to protect and maybe even revive corals. One option is to create more marine protected areas—essentially national parks in the ocean. Scientists say creating marine refuges, where fishing, mining, and recreating are off limits, make the reefs healthier, and so more resilient.An estimated 4,000 fish species, and some 25 percent of marine life, depend on coral reefs at some point in their existence. Fish keep the algae that grow on corals in check, allowing corals to breathe and access sunlight. While an MPA won’t protect corals from heat waves, these natural safe zones can keep fisheries more sustainable in the long term, and fishers around well-managed MPAs often benefit from the “spillover” of healthy fish stocks that populate surrounding waters.At a talk hosted by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Wednesday, renowned marine biologist Sylvia Earle promoted the idea of using marine parks to protect coral, which she does through her organization Mission Blue.“Reefs that have been protected or not yet exploited by fishing impacts survive when nearby places do not,” she says.A recently published assessment of 1,800 reefs in 41 countries found that only 5 percent of reefs were able to provide all of their lucrative byproducts, such as healthy fish stocks and biodiversity. To increase that percentage, new marine reserves will need to be strategically placed in areas well away from humans, say experts. It wouldn’t save all reefs, but it would help ensure that more reefs function at 100 percent of their potential instead of just a fraction, says Alan Friedlander, the chief scientist for National Geographic’s Pristine Seas initiative and an ecologist at the University of Hawaii who helped author the reef assessment.“Without this protection,” he says, “any technological enhancements will suffer the same fate as natural reefs, since the stresses have not abated.”Beyond such nature preserves, some conservationists are looking to more hands-on methods. One research center in the Florida Keys is exploring a form of natural selection to keep corals afloat.The reef system in the Keys has been hit hard by climate change and disease, which is especially tough, because corals there help support fisheries worth an estimated $100 million every year. In addition, corals off Florida’s coasts are polluted by agricultural and sewage runoff.The additional stress from warming waters is like “the proverbial nail in the coffin,” says Erinn Muller, the science director at the Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research and Restoration at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida.To keep the wild ecosystem alive, Muller and her team are harvesting samples of the corals that have survived the environmental stresses naturally, breeding them by hand, and reattaching them to the reef. At any given time, the center has 46,000 corals growing on underwater plastic lattices in its nursery. So far, the center has regrown over 70,000 corals from five different species on damaged reefs.“The ultimate goal is we put ourselves out of a job,” says Muller.In the Bahamas, Ross Cunning, a research biologist at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium, is focusing on corals with robust genes that could make them natural candidates for restoration projects. He recently published a study of two Bahamian reefs, one that seemed to survive an intense 2015 heat wave, and one that didn’t.“It sets the stage to find out which genes are responsible for thermal tolerance,” says Cunning, adding that he hopes identifying those genes will help scientists one day breed more heat-tolerant coral.In Massachusetts, Cohen's research has found two key elements that seem to protect corals. The first: internal waves beneath the ocean’s surface that bring cooler currents to heat-struck corals, essentially air-conditioning them as temperatures rise. The second: adaptation, a trait that corals found in Palau’s warm lagoons seem to exhibit.“What we’ve realized is these corals are sitting in naturally hot water all the time,” she says. On average, these lagoons submerge coral in water that is two degrees Celsius warmer than the water outside the lagoons. “We think the fact that they can deal with these higher temperatures is built into their genetics and allows them to deal with the heat waves.”She’s also found evidence of corals evolving more quickly in the past two decades to withstand rapidly warming temperatures. The big question scientists are now investigating, says Cohen, is whether there’s a cap on how much more heat corals can adapt to.Cohen calls these regions with heat-adapted corals as “super reefs,” and like Friendlander, advocates for using marine reserves to protect them.Muller notes that their efforts on the Florida reefs can help keep them from what she describes as “functional extinction.” But she says the reefs ultimately won’t be restored to their potential until their environment becomes more hospitable to their survival.All the scientists interviewed for this article noted that mitigating climate change is the only long-term, sustainable solution to conserve and restore coral reefs. Despite global lockdowns and sharply falling emissions, atmospheric carbon dioxide still reached a record high in May.Global warming is “raising the background temperature,” compounding regular heat waves and making them even deadlier for corals, says Kristopher Karnauskas, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder who recently published a study investigating the physical causes of the 2016 event.The oceans absorb and store heat very efficiently; as Earth warms, the oceans take in over 90 percent of the planet’s heat trapped in the atmosphere by human-generated greenhouse gases. But their heat-storing capacity isn’t limitless, and excess heat over time takes its toll on ocean inhabitants.In evolutionary history, corals date back 400 million years, and with each global temperature change Earth has undergone, corals have adapted—but never as quickly as they must today.“We know that because there have been six major coral reef extinctions in the geologic past where they were basically wiped out. All those have been associated with excessive heat and ocean acidification,” Cohen says. “Coral reefs always come back, but it takes tens of thousands of years.”Now, with climate change-driven temperatures rising at a rate higher than corals have ever had to naturally adapt to, Cohen says, “we don’t have that kind of time.”",
"A diver explores corals on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia, the largest living structure on EarthThe world’s coral reefs, from the Great Barrier Reef off Australia to the Seychelles off East Africa, are in grave danger of dying out completely by mid-century unless carbon emissions are reduced enough to slow ocean warming, a new UNESCO study says.And consequences could be severe for millions of people.The decline of coral reefs has been well documented, reef by reef. But the new study is the first global examination of the vulnerability of the entire planet’s reef systems, and it paints an especially grim picture. Of the 29 World Heritage reef areas, at least 25 of them will experience twice-per-decade severe bleaching events by 2040—a frequency that will “rapidly kill most corals present and prevent successful reproduction necessary for recovery of corals,” the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization concluded. In some areas, that’s happening already.“These are spectacular places, many of which I’ve visited. Seeing the damage being wrought has just been heartbreaking,” says Mark Eakin, a reef expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and a lead author of the new report. “We’re to the point now where caction is essential. It’s urgent.”By 2100, most reef systems will die, unless carbon emissions are reduced. Many others will be gone even sooner. “Warming is projected to exceed the ability of reefs to survive within one to three decades for the majority of the World Heritage sites containing corals reefs,” the report says. (UN announces new biosphere reserves, while U.S. removes some.)Reefs, often referred to as the rainforests of the oceans, occupy less than one percent of the ocean floor, but provide habitat for a million species, including a fourth of the world’s fish. They also protect coastlines against erosion from tropical storms and act as a barrier to sea-level rise.“It is terrifying to think of the repercussions of the global and large scale loss of reefs,” says Ruth Gates, director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe, Hawaii. “The reduction in food supplies, the lack of coastal protection as the reef collapses and subsequent land erosion will make some places unlivable and people will have to move. And that’s not even mentioning the collapse of reef-related tourism.”In the past three years, 25 reefs—which comprise three-fourths of the world’s reef systems— experienced severe bleaching events in what scientists concluded was the worst-ever sequence of bleachings to date. The Great Barrier Reef was especially hard hit. Other reefs that experienced severe bleaching include the Seychelles, New Caledonia, 750 miles (1,210 kilometers) east of Australia, and the United States, off Hawaii and Florida."The last three years have been extremely depressing for me," Eakin, with NOAA, says. "We're seeing truly catastrophic damage to many reef systems around the world. The Great Barrier Reef damage we've seen is greater than anything we've seen in the past 20 years.”The consequences are already being felt by some people, and will quickly grow more severe, says Eakin's NOAA colleague and co-author Scott F. Heron. Low-lying islands such as Kiribati, a string of 33 coral atolls in the central Pacific Ocean, already see saltwater inundating freshwater drinking sources. Higher tides and crumbling reefs are causing more storm surges. Soon, loss of coral, especially when combined with global overfishing, will translate to fewer fish—and local protein shortages."These are real things that real people are experiencing," Heron says. "I've met these people. They've been to my house. This is happening.”Heron also notes that despite skepticism in some corners about climate change, even the crudest of models from two decades ago predicted just the type of reef damage seen today."If what the models projected back then has started to come true, even with all of their issues, then we should have good faith in the science of the current projections," Heron says. "And those projections say if we don't act there will be many, many serious impacts."Most World Heritage sites are managed locally to control pollutants from farm runoff or overfishing. Now, the “ubiquitous global threat” to reef systems has become so great, Eakin and Heron say, that local protections are not enough. They hope their new, bleak assessment will help the world’s nations to realize that unless they move faster to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these special places—and the people who rely on them—will suffer greatly, far sooner than expected."When someone needs help, the overwhelming majority of us will stretch ourselves to help out—it's a human trait. It's what makes us people," Heron adds. "That the people most impacted by these changes are not necessarily people we encounter in our day-to-day lives does not remove our responsibility to help them."",
"A broad array of species live in Palau's abundant protected waters, including this little goby camouflaged within the branches of a red coral.Countries earn a lot of media buzz for announcing bold plans to section off thousands of square miles of ocean for protection. That’s because scientists say these Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are effective tools to protect the marine plants and animals facing threats from ocean acidification, heatwaves, overfishing, and pollution.MPAs can provide benefits like protecting endangered species or helping replenish fish stocks that spill into neighboring fisheries. The most highly regulated parks have the most benefits. And according to a report released on Wednesday by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), unabated emissions will have severe impacts on biodiversity.But for MPAs to actually reach the level of protection needed to mitigate those impacts of climate change, experts say the UN will have to think much more critically about how they regulate those areas and what will happen to countries that fail to deliver on their promises. If a park remains in limbo for too long—stuck between declaration and implementation—it may be referred to as a “paper park” by conservation groups but will still face little international pushback.In 2014, scientists called for 30 percent of the world’s oceans to be protected by a network of MPAs by 2030, yet it already seems likely the world will fall short of the UN’s goal to protect 10 percent of oceans by 2020. Though the UN says we’re 8 percent of the way there, experts caution that only 2.2 percent of the world’s oceans are fully off limits to commercial activity, and only 4.8 percent is actively managed.The Seychelles' Saint Joseph Island, once a coconut plantation, is now a nature reserve with a marine protected area.“It’s not just 30 percent protected, but 30 percent highly protected,” says Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project.“There are two ways to look at paper parks,” says Russel Moffitt, a program manager for the Atlas of Marine Protection who tracks marine park progress. He says the term can refer to parks that are only designated on paper: “That’s usually a process issue or governance issue.”Paper parks also can spring from “regulations that are so weak, [where] there’s such a lack of enforcement or community involvement that even though there’s a marine reserve, there’s no objective met.”A study published last year in the journal Science found that industrial fishing was present in 432 of the 727 MPAs in the European Union.MPAs are often created in ecologically rich waters where the strict regulations can protect the most life. That can often set up a contentious dynamic between those who want to protect fish and those who want access to them.“I’m not critical of anybody who’s gone through the hard step of delineating an area to be protected,” says Rand. “They’ve really gone through one of the hardest elements [announcing] that extraction at some level will not be allowed.”Rand points to the National Park Service maintenance backlog as an example of the large amount of resources and staff needed to ensure a nature reserve is protected.Oregon State University ecologist Kirsten Grorud-Colvert outlines several ways MPAs can be improved.“The first is just to have a common understanding of what an MPA is and what it can do,” she says.With former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration administrator and current Oregon State University professor Jane Lubchenco, Grorud-Colvert is working on a set of guidelines to clearly define levels of MPAs.“It’s about using the same language,” Grorud-Colvert says.She adds that inspiring countries to take bold action and helping them access international support can also make MPAs more effective.“There’s also an issue of resources and means. You need resources, staff, and equipment,” says Nicolas Fournier, policy and advocacy manager for Oceana, based in Brussels. “That’s a reality that a lot of governments are facing. Sometimes they don’t have the budgets to simply implement them.”In a TED talk he gave last year, National Geographic Explorer Enric Sala advocated for turning the high seas into a marine reserve. Because the high seas sit outside of any national waters, they require a massive international agreement.“Most of the world is unaware that the equivalent of a climate agreement for the oceans is being negotiated right now,” says Rand.A treaty to protect the high seas, an area that covers two-thirds of the ocean, will next be negotiated in early 2020, but it’s yet unclear how strong those protections might be.Rand is optimistic that improvements in satellite technology can be used to more effectively monitor MPAs at a lower cost. Global Fishing Watch pairs satellite monitoring with artificial intelligence, and it has been used to identify spots where illegal fishing runs rampant.Rand also points to energized youth movements and the current spotlight on climate change as sources for having more optimism about protecting more of the world’s oceans.Sala notes the U.K., Chile, the Seychelles, and Palau are examples of countries that have taken the kind of bold action needed to protect the ocean.“Countries need to step up and protect more critical ocean areas to help us avert a mass extinction, produce seafood into the future, and mitigate climate change,” Sala says via email. “The ocean is a victim of climate change, but can also be a solution.”",
"Narwhals swim off the northern shore of Baffin Island, where the Lancaster Sound Conservation Area is located.In Tuvaijuittuq, the ice never melts.“When you’re there it’s very quiet. It’s so beautiful. When you’re on the ice it feels so solid, like concrete,” says Paul Okalik, the senior adviser for Arctic conservation at the World Wildlife Fund and former premier of the Canadian province Nunavut.Tuvaijuittuq, he says, “is like no other place on Earth.”Now the far northern Canadian Arctic region is set to remain pristine thanks to an agreement reached between the Canadian government and Qikiqtani Inuit Assocation (QIA).“Freezing any new human activities will help ensure the ice that never melts will remain true to its name,” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Thursday press conference in the Nunavut city of Iqaluit.Countries vary in their definitions of what constitutes a Marine Protected Area (MPA). In Canada, the designation closes off water from mining, oil, and gas extraction, dumping, and fishing with a method called trawling. Canada’s MPA standards are new, published this past April after official recommendations were made by a panel of experts.Environmentalists say guarding this region from industrial activity will be a refuge for walruses, polar bears, seals, and narwhals as the Arctic ice becomes increasingly unstable.The Canadian government creates MPAs by first placing the selected region under an interim protected period while it finalizes terms of the protected space. In addition to the plan to conserve Tuvaijuittuq, Trudeau also announced the official establishment of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area.The QIA want this new marine conservation to be a model of how indigenous groups should be considered, said PJ Akeeagok, the group’s president.Along with keeping industry out of pristine water, the Canadian government will create jobs in research and data collection, and build critically needed infrastructure like boating docks.“When the negotiations started, it was in the spirit of reconciliation,” says Akeeagok.Akeeagok grew up in Grise Fiord, a town where native Inuit groups were forcefully relocated by the Canadian government. By investing in the region’s economy, the government is finally paying the community back for what they have taken, he said.“Although there’s a dark history in our chapter, our job is to start painting a bright future for Inuit. We want an economy that is self sustaining,” says Akeeagok.Okalik says having a community that’s bought into the idea of protecting the region will help ensure its regulations are enforced.“This will support local economies and conservation, which is our goal,” says Okalik. “We’re trying to maintain a viable, conservation-based economy.”Climate change is leading to higher rates of warming in the Arctic than anywhere on Earth, and ice once thought stable is loosening. So much ice has sloughed off that it’s sparked concerns that a new Cold War could be brewing at the top of the Earth, this one over who might control the waters once unpassable for large vessels.“Inuit are at the front lines of those who see and feel climate change. There’s predictability that is not there anymore, in terms of ice and weather conditions, We hear it directly from hunters,” says Akeeagok.Both Akeeagok and Okalik are optimistic that official government investment in the natural environment and Inuit people will preserve the region long term.“I am very encouraged by the progress being made by the government to work with local indigenous populations,” says Okalik. “I hope this is something we will continue because it has been missing in the past.”",
"Beluga whales feed at the edge of sea ice in the Fram Strait, east of Greenland. Scientists on a Greenpeace expedition in May investigated how the loss of ice would affect belugas and other whales.On a bright May morning, a helicopter lifts off the Esperanza, a Greenpeace ship, and heads north, tracking the edge of the sea ice east of Greenland. Below us is Fram Strait, a deep ocean channel and one of the Arctic’s richest feeding grounds, where narwhals, bowhead whales, and beluga whales gather each spring to feast at the ice edge.We’re on the lookout for these ocean giants. It’s day three of a two-week expedition, and so far, there’s no sign of any whales. Already, the sea ice is melting, releasing some of the richest fare on offer in the frozen Arctic: ice algae, specialist life forms that live in water pockets at the bottom of the ice. Animal plankton will eat them, and they in turn will become food for bowheads as well as for fish and squid, which are staples in the diets of narwhals and beluga whales.On Norway's Svalbard islands, on the eastern edge of Fram Strait, glaciers are melting and surging into the sea.“Whales don’t eat the algae, but they do eat the stuff that eats the algae,” says Hillary Glandon, a whale biologist from the University of North Carolina Wilmington.Like the rest of the Arctic, Fram Strait is changing fast, and Glandon is one of a team of scientists now trying to figure out what that means for the whales that time their visits to dine on the region’s sumptuous spring feast. The expedition, involving two ships, is the first leg of an 11-month, Greenpeace-funded, pole-to-pole voyage to highlight the need to protect the high seas, outside territorial waters.In the past 30 years, plankton-eating baleen whales–humpbacks, fins and minkes–have begun to venture into parts of the Arctic such as the Chukchi Sea, between Alaska and Siberia, where sea ice has retreated and plankton are flourishing in the sunlit waters. According to one forecast, the waters off northern Siberia in particular may grow increasingly productive over the course of this century, as the planet continues to warm.Fram Strait is more complicated. Caught between the deep waters of the Arctic and Atlantic, it’s experiencing climate change from both directions. The sea ice drifting into Fram Strait from the north has thinned—by as much as 30 percent in 15 years—but it’s still here in abundance, and it’s being melted by ever warmer waters drifting in from the south. For now, there’s an even richer banquet of nutritious ice algae on offer for any whale that manages to partake. “In the short term a surplus of food is good,” says Glandon.But this boom is unlikely to last. The entire region could be ice-free in summer within 20 years. “Once the ice goes, the algae goes,” says Glandon. The question is what happens then to the rest of the ecosystem.(Read about how even polar bears depend on ice algae.)Unlike phytoplankton, the microscopic algae that float in open water and blossom in the sunshine, sea-ice algae are adapted to living in low-light conditions. Trapped in extremely salty, cold pockets of water near the bottom of the ice, these algae “are like the shadow plants of a forest. They thrive in the half-light,” says Ilka Peeken, a polar biologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.To survive, they’ve had to adapt. “Everyone has to use some insulation to survive here,” says Peeken. “Just like the seals and whales, the algae produce lipids—they put on some fat—to protect themselves.”As the Arctic ice recedes, allowing more light to hit the sea surface, it will fuel blooms of phytoplankton. In the short term, the overall mass of microscopic plants should rise in some parts of Fram Strait.The problem is, phytoplankton are much less fatty and nutritious than ice algae. “Potentially we are moving from a luxury food item to a fast food item,” says Thomas Brown, a marine ecologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Argyll, Scotland. “It’s like having access to nice restaurants in your neighbourhood. If something happens and they close, you’re left with a few crappy fast food chains. That affects body condition.”What’s more, it’s not just the quality of food that’s important, it’s also the timing. Being tolerant of low light, the ice algae grow rapidly early in the year, before the phytoplankton are blooming. Many species, such as copepods—tiny animal plankton—time their arrival and the birth of their young to coincide with the spring thaw, when ice algae are released into the ocean.One of the Greenpeace ships, the MY Arctic Sunrise, is seen here in front of the Dahlbreen glacier in Svalbard.“If you have an animal that’s expecting its meal to be put on the table at a particular time, and that doesn’t happen, that can have a catastrophic effect. How will it feed its young? How will it reproduce?” asks Brown.Captain Sergiy Demydov leads a briefing with the Arctic Sunrise crew.Without the ice, there’s likely to be less food available in the Arctic throughout the whole year, says Mattias Cape, a biological oceanographer at the University of Washington and one of the Arctic research team. “If you remove all the sea ice from the Arctic, what you’re left with is a surface layer that will keep warming,”With a warm top layer, the ocean mixes less, and fewer plant nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus reach the surface from the ocean’s depths. Without a constant supply of nutrients, phytoplankton can’t continue to grow. Typically, in an ice-free Arctic there will be one big phytoplankton bloom and then little to follow.“For us, if we had one meal—a really nutritious breakfast— that would be great, but we’d be struggling the next day if we didn’t have lunch or dinner,” says Cape. “So, if you have one pulse of productivity in April or May, but then very little food for the rest of the year, that’s a concern.”In a makeshift lab on board the Arctic Sunrise, the second Greenpeace ship, Glandon peers down a microscope at a bunch of copepods. Some of them are literally stuffed with green ice algae or visible oil sacs—little yellow lipid parcels they accumulate by feeding on the fatty algae.To compound the problem of there being fewer ice algae as sea ice disappears, the copepods have faster metabolisms at higher water temperatures and thus burn through their oil sacs more quickly—further reducing food quality for larger predators like whales. How well predators cope with these changing conditions will depend on whether they can switch between foods.“There will be winners and losers,” says Heather Koopman, another member of the Arctic team and a whale biologist at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington. “Some animals will show flexibility in their feeding behaviour and will do well.”Belugas and narwhals, for example, are opportunistic feeders that can eat a large variety of fish and crustaceans. For baleen whales, switching diet is much harder. Minke and fin whales have short, coarse baleen, which is ideal for eating large fish and krill. Bowheads, on the other hand, have longer, fine baleen, specifically adapted to eating copepods and unsuitable for eating fish. They may suffer most.“But life is not just about eating—it’s also about getting through the rest of your day,” says Koopman. Narwhals, for example, hide under the sea ice to seek refuge from killer whales.On day seven of the expedition, our pilot, Martin, takes us a full 50 miles north of the ships, to where the ice floes turn to solid pack ice. We spot polar bear tracks in the snow and the occasional fulmar or ivory gull riding the breeze. Still no whales.In the 17th Century, before whaling decimated the population, bowheads numbered more than 50,000 adults in Fram Strait. They were so abundant that simply by eating and excreting in these nutrient-rich waters, they helped to fertilize the ocean depths, here and elsewhere.“Today, there are so few whales left that we don’t think of them as being important at the level of trees or bugs, but in the past—when they were abundant—they had a vital role in ocean health,” says Alyson Fleming, a whale biologist on the North Carolina team.Whaling disrupted the ecological cycle in these waters, and now global warming is doing it again. Scientists estimate that only around 100 bowhead whales are left near Fram Strait, which may explain our difficulty in finding them.“It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack,” says Koopman, who finally saw a large pod of around 30 belugas, after I’d left.For the whales that feed here, the future is dicey. Says Glandon: “If you lose the ice, the whole system falls apart.”",
"A mother polar bear and her cub traverse the sea ice in Nunavut, Canada.Every winter, Arctic sea ice grows around the pole, its frozen tendrils threading along northern coasts. Right now sea ice has just passed its peak coverage for the year, and will begin to shrink with the coming of spring. It’s a crucial time for polar bears, whose food supply is inextricably linked to sea ice.And in recent decades, sea ice has been shrinking faster than ever. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2019 has the seventh-lowest sea ice cover in the Arctic since they began collecting satellite data 40 years ago.This year “doesn't break any records, but it's the trend that matters,” says University of Alberta polar bear scientist Andrew Derocher. “The downward trend in Arctic sea ice across all months is the concern,” he says, and “now we wait to see what spring conditions bring.” (Read more about global warming’s link to polar bears.)A cold spring allows ice to linger, giving polar bears easier access to one of their favorite foods: seals. A warm spring cuts short the availability of their food super-highway. “For polar bears, it's survival of the fattest,” Derocher says.Fatter bears have better insurance to survive the ice-free summer when food is scarce or non-existent. And fatter females need energy to successfully birth and nurse healthy babies. “No polar bear ever looked in a melt pond and thought, I'm too fat," jokes Derocher.We’ve long known that sea ice is an important platform for polar bears to hunt and raise young, but it turns out that the ice itself also carries a valuable energy source.More than 70 percent of polar bears’ diet—at least for three bear populations in northern Canada—can be traced back to the algae growing on sea ice, according to research published in 2018 in the journal PLoS ONE.You might picture sea ice as a vast, chunky expanse of white. That’s the view from above. But seen from below, sea ice is coated with a greenish-brown mat made up of many algae species.A polar bear watches her cubs on the Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada. The bay is famous for polar bears, but their population is in decline.If you’re now picturing massive jaws chowing down on a crunchy icy meal covered in green slime, no, that’s not it. Polar bears do not eat sea ice directly. Instead, researchers found that the majority of polar bears’ diet is made up of critters that ultimately depend on sea-ice algae as a food source. Their study examined polar bears from Baffin Bay, western Hudson Bay, and southern Hudson Bay.Polar bears eat a lot of seals, and in some places, beluga whales too. Both seals and whales eat fish and other creatures that get their energy from tiny creatures called zooplankton, which in turn eat the algae on sea ice. One of the polar bear’s favorite meals, the ringed seal, eats a variety of fish and shrimp that munch on algae-eating plankton. (See what happens when polar bear finds a camera.)Individually, these algae are “smaller than a hair’s width,” says Thomas Brown, a marine ecologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science. But collectively, tiny sea ice algae have a massive impact on polar ecosystems.After each long dark Arctic winter, spring light stimulates algal growth. That provides a bonanza for tiny creatures called copepods, amphipods, and zooplankton that feed on sea-ice undersides. In summer as ice melts, the algae sink. Fish that scour the sediments, and seals that eat those fish, create the links that clamber up the food chain to polar bears.Over the years, Brown has explored polar ecosystems from the bottom up, so to speak. While examining starfish and sea urchins on the seafloor, he found that they contained a chemical also found in sea-ice algae, indicating that algae from up above had made it into their food supply.Then Brown and his team looked for this chemical, called IP25, as a biomarker of sea-ice algae’s presence in polar bears. They collaborated with government officials in the Canadian territory of Nunavut and with Inuit people, who provided liver samples from subsistence-hunted polar bears. The results showed that carbon derived from sea ice dominated the predators' diets.The University of Alberta's Derocher applauds the study, adding there are 19 polar bear populations across the Arctic, so the next obvious next step is to examine more of them. (Read how polar bears are showing up in surprising places.)He adds that while ecosystems are robust, if you take away one component, “it won’t be that same ecosystem over time.” He thinks of sea ice as akin to soil in a forested ecosystem: “It’s a substrate that’s essential to the ecosystem as we know it.”Sea ice is already known as important habitat for polar bears. “But what if we’re not seeing the whole picture, and what if sea ice is more important than we’re giving it credit for?” says Brown. “Less sea ice means less habitat, not only for polar bears but, importantly, also for the sea ice microorganisms that form a big part of the very base of the bear’s food chain,” he says.With sea ice availability changing, “we may need to revise our assessments of how threatened polar bears are likely to be,” says Brown. It’s too early to tell, he adds, but it’s clear that for polar bears, ice is nice in multiple ways.",
"Not too long ago I was the guide on a wildlife-photography trip to Svalbard, an archipelago halfway between Norway’s mainland and the North Pole. After two days of travel on a small passenger ship along the harsh and icy coast, we reached Hornsund fjord on the southern tip of Spitsbergen island. Wildlife is abundant in this remote and fragile area, and we were looking for seals and polar bears.When we anchored the boat at the fjord ice, we spotted several seals resting on the ice, but no polar bears. I thought I’d try to get a picture of a seal as it came up for breath at a hole in the ice. I placed my camera and a motion sensor near the edge of a hole. The plan was that the motion sensor would fire the camera when the seal poked its head into the air. The image would capture the seal with the cold and hostile environment behind it.On the way back to the ship, I wondered whether I should have anchored the camera, just in case. But returning to the hole would have disturbed the seals further and possibly prevented me from getting the shot. I decided not to do it.Then, at two in the morning, a crew member woke us up. He had spotted a polar bear approaching in the distance under the midnight sun. We ran to the bow of the boat to see what would happen. At first the bear walked toward the boat. Then it turned and headed directly for my camera. I had long dreamed of taking a picture of a polar bear while it waited beside a breathing hole, hoping to grab a seal. I knew it would be a difficult photo to get, but here I could see it happening right in front of me, a dream very close to coming true.The motion sensor reacted to the bear’s movement, triggering the camera to start taking pictures. The bear circled the camera, gently sniffing and even licking it. Then the bear knocked the sensor onto the ice, grabbed the tripod, and tipped it and the camera into the hole. The camera hung from the sensor’s cable. I prayed that it would stay that way so I could at least rescue the memory card containing the images.The bear must have heard me. It took the sensor’s cable in its mouth and started backing away from the hole, pulling the camera out.Then the cable broke. My camera and the memory card with all those impossible-to-get close-ups of the polar bear disappeared more than 450 feet beneath the ice.That was the worst moment in my photography career. I did not sleep well for a long time afterward. I was so angry with myself. I couldn’t let it go. I started playing with the crazy idea of rescuing the camera. I tried to find someone who would help me find it, but my colleagues in polar research told me that the camera had most likely sunk into the soft mud commonly found in front of glaciers. I almost gave up.A year later I was asked to join a similar trip to the same spot on the same boat. I obtained permission to bring a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and a colleague to pilot it. We would try to find the camera. If we didn’t succeed, I would know I had at least tried. Maybe I would then be able to stop thinking about that camera. I hate to give up.When we arrived back at Hornsund fjord, we were given only four hours for the operation due to the paying customers on board. There was a lot more fjord ice in front of the glacier than there had been on the previous trip, and we wondered whether it would be safe to walk so far from the boat. As I knew well, polar bears could be nearby. We decided to risk it. The ice was so thin that it bent beneath us. We almost turned back several times, but then we managed to find a safe route to where my camera had disappeared one year earlier. Now we just had to find it.We ran into technical difficulties almost immediately and had to pull the ROV out of the water twice. The water was murky, so we couldn’t see to steer the ROV, and the tidal current was causing it to drift from the site. Our only chance of finding the camera was by landing the ROV on top of it, which seemed like a long shot.Then, like a miracle, on the third try the ROV found the camera. We shouted and danced around on the ice.Our celebration was premature. When we tried to grab the camera, the ROV’s cable became tangled. The claw on the ROV’s arm was less than an inch from the camera—close but not close enough to grab it. We could hear the arm scratch against the camera’s sides.Then we lost control of the ROV. The pilot was sure it was broken. I was even more frustrated than I had been the year before. I wondered if it would have been better if we had never found the camera at all.We retrieved the ROV and saw that the propellers were jammed with seaweed. We had just enough time for one more try. Amazingly we managed to place the ROV on the camera a second time. This time the claw clamped securely onto the tripod. We got the camera up on the ice, and I screamed as loudly as I could.The camera was corroded, but I managed to get the memory card out. I immediately put it into distilled freshwater to prevent further corrosion. I kept it there until I returned to the mainland. Then I contacted a company that retrieves lost electronic data in crime cases. They managed to retrieve all 149 of my photos.It was amazing to see them. I saw the polar bear breathing. I saw it licking the lens until the lens became blurry. I saw it prod the lens with its massive, furry white paw. And, at the end, I saw the looming edge of the breathing hole.Retrieving that camera is by far the most satisfying accomplishment of my photography career. I have never experienced such a massive burst of adrenaline as I did when we pulled that camera out of the water and onto the ice.",
"A remote camera trap is pretty simple. It’s just a normal DSLR camera connected to a motion trigger. I don’t push the shutter button, the animal trips an infrared beam, and then click, click, click. It’s really the only way to make intimate wide-angle pictures of wild animals without disturbing them. Pronghorn like to see far and run fast—it’s impossible to get close to them. So, if I’m around, they are not, that’s why I need to use a remote camera trap. (See the previous story and video in this series.)I first saw this style and method of wildlife photography through the work of the legends of camera trap photography, Michael Nick Nichols and Steve Winter. I first learned how to use camera traps by just trying them out, trial and error—with lots of errors! Then in 2010 I worked for Steve Winter as his assistant on a tiger story. That’s when I really started to learn the ins and outs. He taught me a lot about gear, but more importantly he taught me how to travel and how to think about and approach photographing a story. And, this past year, I worked with Nick Nichols on the big Yellowstone single-topic issue of National Geographic coming out in 2016. Here’s the gear needed to build a camera trap.– Nikon DSLR with wide-angle lens– Trailmaster 1550 trigger– custom weatherproof housing, camouflaged– extra batteries and big SD cardsIn addition, I’ve been using a lot video camera traps because I’m working on an Elk River film. Video traps are surprisingly different than still photo traps. With video, I’m trying to get the camera recording before the animal enters the frame and allow the animal to move through the frame. With still photography I’m trying to capture a moment when the animal is near the camera and evokes a sense of migration and movement.At the end of the day, camera traps are a tool, sometimes they work really well, but most of the time they don’t because of weather or battery issues. They require a helluva lot of patience. I’m happy if I make a couple good camera trap pictures in a full year. Yes, one year. Some of the best locations I find are after the migration has happened, I see their tracks, so I return the following year to set up a camera trap before they get there.See the previous story and video in this series.The Adventurists blog series “Freedom to Move” is sponsored by Toyota TRD Pro, which provided a vehicle for this adventure.",
"Polar bears are normally seen along the Arctic coasts or on ocean ice, like here along the Hudson Bay. But recently, things have changed.Ryan Kunz was sleeping in his tent on the ice when the polar bear wandered into camp. At 10,500 feet high, in the middle of the Greenland Ice Sheet more than 200 miles from the nearest coast, the remote U.S. scientific research station was about the last place anyone expected one of these sea ice-dwelling animals to be.Yet here it was, lumbering around the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Summit Station, the highest-altitude, northernmost science operation in the Arctic, where key meteorology and other research is conducted. Kunz, a carpenter from Florida, was one of the half-dozen or so workers sleeping in “Tent City”—a collection of orange domes atop snow glinting in the June 24-hour sunlight. It was 5:13 a.m.“I woke up and people were screaming at us that there was a bear,” Kunz recalls. “It didn’t make sense to me there was a bear there.”Never before had a polar bear been seen this far up the ice sheet, and people had generally assumed it wasn’t possible. Thinking it was perhaps some sort of drill, he and the other Tent City residents began walking casually toward the Big House, a hard-sided building up on stilts.“We come around the corner and there is a polar bear maybe 30 to 50 feet away, and it was coming at us,” says Kunz. “That definitely picked up our speed!”The standoff lasted 36 hours. Most of the 31 staff onsite hunkered indoors, while a few drove loud machinery around the site to repel the bear. Some tried launching food far off onto the ice in an effort to lure it away. Mahi mahi was the bear’s favorite, according to the general consensus of people who watched as it roamed the station: investigating the outhouse, poking its nose into tents, and trying to get into the garbage throughout that day, night and into the next day.The female bear’s incredible journey to the top of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest ice sheet last month [June 13-14] may have set a record for a polar bear climb, says polar bear expert Andrew Derocher. While the bears, whose normal habitat is sea ice, do sometimes travel inland and cross glaciers, “I can’t imagine anywhere else that a bear could get that high off the ground,” says Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta, Canada, and scientific advisor to Polar Bears International. “It’s such a weird thing, I mean here’s an animal that spends its whole life at sea level.”But climate change is decimating polar bears’ sea ice habitat across the Arctic, leading to an International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List classification as “vulnerable.” With bears forced to venture afield for food at the same time that humans increasingly venture north for resources and recreation, Derocher and others say such encounters are likely to increase.Indeed, this was the third time in the past three years that a polar bear has made its way to a science station deep in the Greenland Ice Sheet interior. Twice before, one had been seen at a Danish ice coring site 8,800 feet up, including one just a few weeks earlier.Fortunately, no people were hurt in any of those incidents. But, while seals are the bears’ normal diet, they have been known to prey on humans. Earlier this month, one fatally mauled a man who was on an outing with his children in western Hudson Bay, Canada. Two years ago, scientists on a remote Russian Arctic island were trapped in their cabin for days by a pack of polar bears that ate one of their dogs.This polar bear rummaged through the Summit Station at the top of Greenland this summer, where the animals had never been seen before.A study released last year analyzed reported polar bear attacks on humans across the Arctic between 1870 and 2014, and tallied 73 confirmed attacks, with 20 deaths. The study concluded that, while attacks on humans were historically rare, the greatest number took place in 2010-2014—years with exceedingly low summer sea ice, which is rapidly declining due to climate change. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, Arctic sea ice extent this June was the fourth lowest since satellite observations began in 1981.Polar bears are coming into communities more often these days, says Kristin Laidre, a marine biologist at the University of Washington’s Polar Science Center, and an authority on polar bear populations in Greenland. “It’s happening all over the Arctic, and it’s something that’s only going to be an increasing problem as we continue to lose sea ice,” she says.While it’s too soon to tell whether the three recent polar bear visits high in the ice sheet’s interior mean such epic treks will become more common, Laidre says, “I think as we move forward towards this ice-free Arctic, bears are going to end up places they wouldn’t prefer to be.” (The “starving polar bear” photographers explain what they would have done differently.)As for the polar bear’s visit to Summit Station, it ended happily for everyone but the bear. A sharpshooter flown in from Iceland killed it, after warning shots failed to drive it away.For now, Tent City will stand empty, with everyone crowding into the facility’s two indoor dormitories. A “bear spotter” from New Zealand has been bought in to patrol at night. Safety practices at other NSF research sites in known bear country, such as Alaska, will now be instituted up on the ice sheet, says Jennifer Mercer, program manager for Arctic research and support.“It is common for researchers to carry weapons as well as bear deterrents, such as bear spray, air horns, and things like that,” says Mercer. “The difference at Summit Station is that it is extremely far inland. We’ve never had a bear enter the station before.”Kunz said he was only scared after the fact, when he read about polar bears’ predatory behavior.“It looked so cute. It was like the cutest thing in the world,” he says. “But it definitely needed some food. It was a young female, a long way from where it needed to be.”",
"Atop the highest mountains and tallest trees, wildlife abounds.On almost every continent, there are animals thriving in high places. These creatures aren’t afraid of heights, nor should they be. Every one of these high-flying, mountain scaling animals has evolved, over millions of years, the ability to flourish in places humans can't reach without a helicopter. This collection of images, taken by National Geographic photographers, illustrates the immense diversity of life that exists above us.",
"U.S. Marines and Green Berets patrol the tundra near a radar station outside Barrow, Alaska, during a training exercise. The troops were participating in an annual U.S. military operation called “Arctic Edge.”For most of human history the very top of the globe has remained out of play, too cold, too distant, and too dangerous for the kinds of intense exploitation that have reshaped other regions. But the Arctic is now warming faster than any place on earth, and its protective barrier of sea ice—which once kept commercial and military ambition in check—is melting away.A long-range radar installation rears up from the tundra in Hall Beach, Nunavut, Canada. The radar is one of 50 unmanned surveillance stations that keep watch over North America’s northern frontier, stretching from Canada’s eastern coast to the west coast of Alaska. Called the North Warning System, the radar line is jointly operated by Canadian and U.S. forces under NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command.Today, the Arctic is routinely described as an emerging frontier, and many polar nations, along with a few that have no Arctic borders, are angling for access to the region’s rich stores of fish, gas, oil, and other mineral resources. By most measures, the U.S. has lagged far behind other countries in this race, including Russia, Norway, and even China. That may be about to change.On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at a meeting of the Arctic Council, an international organization composed of the eight Arctic nations, plus representatives of the region’s indigenous peoples.Frost-faced members of a Canadian aircrew head back to hot meals and showers after enduring a week of temperatures as low as -60°C during an outdoor survival course.“This is America’s moment to stand up as an Arctic nation and for the Arctic’s future,” Pompeo said. “Because far from the barren backcountry that many thought it to be … the Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance.”For many scientists, analysts, and native people, the rapid and severe transformations unfolding in the Arctic, including ice loss and melting permafrost, are considered negative consequences of climate change, omens of worse to come. But Pompeo recast those omens as opportunities.Disappearing sea ice could increase trade, he told the council, by allowing cargo ships to cross the Arctic via the Northwest Passage and the so-called Northern Sea Route. Pompeo said those sea lanes could become “21s century Suez and Panama Canals,” that would “potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days.”Pompeo’s remarks stood in sharp contrast to previous U.S. policy, which many Arctic experts have described as “American reluctance.” Until this point, the administration of President Donald Trump has seemed mostly uninterested in the region, and most previous presidents invested little there.Under Trump, climate change and global warming have become almost unmentionable, even to the point of denial, and Pompeo used neither term in his speech. Last year, Trump even defunded a Coast Guard plan to build more icebreakers. He later reauthorized the measure, though the U.S. still has only one heavy breaker capable of sailing through into thick ice.This fresh interest in the Arctic—Pompeo’s and the administration’s—can be traced to bold and aggressive moves by Russia and China, both of which have made significant investments in northern gas and oil infrastructure. Russia has also greatly expanded its military forces in the Arctic, becoming, by most measures, the dominant cold-weather player. And China has declared itself a “near-Arctic state,” articulating its desire for a seat at the table in polar decision-making.Pompeo said he welcomed cooperation with both nations, and then he warned them against taking provocative actions. He criticized Russia’s military build-up as “destabilizing” and said both nations’ Arctic moves would be judged in the context of their behavior elsewhere. In particular, he mentioned Russia’s “aggressive action in Ukraine” and China’s territorial claims over the South China Sea.NATO soldiers and airmen learn how to carve a temporary shelter into drifted snow at the Canadian military’s Crystal City training facility near Resolute Bay in Nunavut.Air crews learn how to use emergency flares during cold weather survival training at the U.S. military’s Northern Warfare Training Center in Black Rapids, Alaska.The fact that the two former rivals were cooperating in the Arctic seemed to particularly trouble Pompeo,“Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?” he asked. “Do we want the fragile Arctic environment exposed to the same ecological devastation caused by China’s fishing fleet in the seas off its coast, or unregulated industrial activity in its own country? I think the answers are pretty clear.”U.S. soldiers drop over the Donnelly Training Area near Fort Greely, Alaska. In October 2018, the training area hosted some 6,000 soldiers during a war games exercise named Arctic Anvil.Pompeo’s speech played directly into a narrative of increasing competition—and potential military conflict—that has been building for years. The storylines focus on melting ice and increased shipping, troop movements, and new bases but rarely focus on indigenous concerns, wildlife, or even the larger climate disruptions that could follow.“Not only will it hit us first, but it’s harder for us to deal with it because we’re so isolated and our resources are so limited,” said Joe Savikataaq, premier of the Canadian province of Nunavut. “We’re up here, and it feels like we’re up in no-man’s land.”In the frigid temperatures of the High Arctic, survival means finding shelter—or making your own. Here, at a survival course held at the Crystal City training facility on Resolute Bay on the Northwest Passage, Inuit instructors Jolie Qaunaq (left) and Andy Issigaitok teach soldiers and pilots from Canada, the United Kingdom, and France how to build an iglu from blocks of snow.Waiting for help during a search-and-rescue training exercise, a Canadian Ranger lies in a pool of melted ice near the Clyde River community on Baffin Island. The Rangers are a volunteer reserve group mostly from Native communities across northern and remote regions in Canada.The beginning of this conflict can be traced to a calm morning in August 2007, when a pair of Russian submersibles dropped 14,000 feet to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and planted a flag made of titanium at the North Pole. It was a strategic move, made with drama in mind, and images broadcast around the world of the Russian tricolor standing on the seabed drew quick condemnation in the West.“This isn’t the 15th century,” said Peter MacKay, then foreign minister of Canada, on CTV television. “You can’t go around the world and just plant flags and say, ‘We’re claiming this territory.’”MacKay was technically correct; the Russian stunt held no legal weight. But his rebuke carried a note of petulance, as though he wished the whole thing had been Canada’s idea. Ten years on, MacKay’s reaction is easier to understand. 2007 was, at the time, one of the warmest years on record, and the Arctic summer ice pack—the vast expanse of floating ice that covers the North Pole even through the summer—had shrunk to the lowest levels ever recorded. The frozen polar sea, foil to human ambition for centuries, appeared to be melting, and Russia was staking a symbolic claim on whatever lay beneath the slush.“Keep moving” is a key principle in Arctic military operations, when anything—or anyone—standing still long in subzero temperatures risks freezing in place. Here, Canadian Captain Wayne LeBlanc and Master Corporal Jeff Valentiate walk north on Cornwallis Island.“The summer of 2007 saw the largest Arctic ice-loss in human history and was not predicted by even the most aggressive climate models,” says Jonathan Markowitz, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. “This shock led everyone to suddenly understand that the ice was rapidly disappearing and some nations decided to start making moves.”In the decade since that “shock event,” the Arctic has been transformed by rising temperatures, vanishing ice, and international attention. Entrepreneurs, prospectors, and politicians have all turned north, recognizing that less ice means more access.“Predictions about the Arctic Ocean have been wrong,” says Michael Sfraga, director of the Polar Initiative at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. “And now there’s an ocean opening up before us, in real time. This hasn’t happened before.”But Arctic investment has been uneven. Russia and Norway have been the most proactive Arctic nations, according to Markowitz, spending heavily on natural gas and oil infrastructure. Russia’s ice-capable fleet is the largest in the world, numbering some 61 icebreakers and ice-hardened ships with another 10 under construction. Norway's ice-hardened fleet has grown from 5 to 11 ships.The Chinese are also more than passive investors, and their Arctic maneuvers tend to generate some of the loudest headlines. In 2016, a Chinese mining company tried to buy an abandoned naval base in Greenland. In 2017, the first Chinese icebreaker sailed through the Northwest Passage on a scientific survey. And in 2018, the Chinese government published a white paper outlining its Arctic plans—and its intention to play a greater role in the region.Other Arctic nations, including the United States, Canada, and Denmark, lavish far less attention on their northern territories. Sfraga and others have called the U.S. a “reluctant Arctic power,” and Markowitz points out that although Canada often talks about raising its northern game, there’s little behind the words.“National interests are largely a function of income and revenue,” Markowitz says. “What states make influence what they take, and states that make things—like the U.S.—are much less interested in securing Arctic resources. The Russians, on the other hand, don’t make much. They don’t have a Silicon Valley or a New York City and they view the Arctic as their strategic future resource base.”The disequilibrium in Arctic approaches has worried some observers and led to news headlines that regularly describe the Arctic as a kind of Wild West, or as a frigid theater where nations will square off in the next Cold War. Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 and China’s ongoing play for military dominance in the South China Sea have intensified anxiety.Markowitz, who has been tracking military development in the Arctic for years, says that Russia maintains 27 operational military bases above the Arctic Circle, more than double the number it had before the “shock event” of 2007. The U.S., in contrast, keeps just one base in the Arctic, an air force installation on borrowed ground in Greenland. Canada, which is second only to Russia in the size of its northern territory, has only three small Arctic bases.Canadian and American forces do operate bases just south of the Arctic Circle, though, in Alaska and the Northwest Territories, and Sfraga said both nations are capable of rapidly dispatching aircraft, troops, and submarines into Arctic territory. The two nations are also slowly expanding their cold-weather military infrastructure. Canada is building a naval refueling base on Baffin Island, and the U.S. announced plans earlier this year to re-establish the Navy’s Second Fleet, which will counter Russian activity in the North Atlantic.In the meantime, Canadian and U.S. forces, along with other members of NATO, continue to regularly train for cold weather conflict. Last October, in Norway, NATO conducted its largest training exercise since the end of the Cold War—two-weeks of war games involving 50,000 troops from 31 nations. The massive operation, called Trident Juncture, imagined a scenario in which northern Norway is invaded, prompting allies to rush to its defense. The gallery here reveals how extreme even practicing for a war in the north can be.While the imaginary enemy in Trident Juncture wasn’t named, Norway shares Arctic land and sea borders with Russia, and tension between the two nations has risen in recent years. Some observers worry that future disputes between the neighbors over fishing or mineral rights could pull the NATO alliance into a conflict for which it is unprepared.Despite the war games, Russia’s military build-up, and Pompeo’s recent remarks, the Arctic remains one of the world’s calmer regions, where contact between nations is relatively open and stable. Russia, Norway, the U.S., and five other Arctic countries are all members of the Arctic Council, a group formed in 1996 to encourage communication and cooperation across the pole. Even as NATO forces gather in Norway, the council continues coordinating meetings on Arctic science, environmental issues, and search-and-rescue operations.Sfraga and Markowitz agree that the Arctic Council, operating outside the military framework of NATO, offers one of the best paths forward for easing strain. Some experts also point to the south pole—where an international treaty has preserved Antarctica “for peaceful purposes only”—as a model for what could be possible in the Arctic.For now, many military and political analysts consider the Arctic an unlikely battlefield. Global warming has begun transforming the region, but the qualities that have frustrated human ambition and desire in the north for hundreds of years remain powerful.“If it came to war in the Arctic, you’d really be fighting two enemies,” Brigadier General Mike Nixon said last year at the headquarters of Canada’s Joint Task Force North, in Yellowknife. “And the more dangerous of them would be the cold.”Nixon was careful to say that Russia’s Arctic military activity remains well below Cold War levels, and he dismissed the idea of potential land grabs or invasions. The cold is too intense, he said, the ice pack still vast and thick, the polar distances enormous. Planting a flag at the bottom of the sea is one thing. Sending troops across the ice is quite another.“If someone actually decided to launch an attack over the pole,” Nixon said, “it would quickly turn into the largest search and rescue operation the world has ever seen.”",
"It stands to reason that if you protect the ocean, ecosystems will thrive. Now, scientists have hard data to back up that logical assumption, thanks to a sweeping study of marine reserves in the island nation of Palau.Nearly two years ago, Palau officially designated 193,000 square miles of its maritime territory as a fully protected marine reserve, where no fishing or mining can take place. The reserve became the sixth-largest of its kind in the world—while the island of Palau is smaller than New York City, its marine protected area became larger than the state of California.In a statement made at the time, Palau's President Tommy Remengesau, Jr., said the move was essential to conserving the island's livelihood: "Island communities have been among the hardest hit by the threats facing the ocean. Creating this sanctuary is a bold move that the people of Palau recognize as essential to our survival."Now, science has confirmed the case: In a paper published March 30 in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers from the Fisheries Ecology Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii report the results of their efforts set out to monitor just how much positive impact a marine protected area could have.Their study focused heavily on the amount of biomass—fish and so-called benthic organisms living on the sea floor—that were present in Palau’s protected areas. To disturb the marine life as little as possible, the researchers didn’t take any samples and instead derived their results from photographs and direct visual estimates.They found that protected waters had twice the number of fish as unprotected waters and five times the number of predatory fish. As a key food source for other predators, a healthy fish population indicates a thriving ecosystem."What we measured confirmed that no-take marine reserves help increase the biomass of fish, as we've seen in other areas around the world," says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer-in-residence who worked on the study.Protected areas allow Palau’s fish to produce more offspring, which in turn produces a number of benefits for local fishers. The study suggests that when biomass increases inside protected areas, the resulting spillover of adult fish populations into non-protected waters leads to more abundant catches for local fisheries.Sala notes that this successful conservation was attributable not only to policy instated by the local government, but also to the culture of conservation among the island's inhabitants.The nation has no military with which to enforce regulations. Instead, local conservation efforts evolved from a thousand-year-old tradition called bul. The practice takes place when Palau's Council of Chiefs places certain reefs off limits to allow fish undisturbed space to breed and feed. Heeding the sensitivity of fish during these periods ensured populations would be sufficient for feeding local communities at later times in the year.Palau depends heavily on a healthy marine ecosystem. It has one of the highest rates of biodiversity on the planet, and a significant portion of its economic revenue is generated by environmental tourism.Of course, Palau isn’t the only country to benefit from healthy marine resources, and only 1.6 percent of the world's oceans are protected. The researchers hope other governments will take notice of how beneficial these protected areas can be.“We need as many more reserves as possible in remote and in populated places, large and not so large," saysid Sala. "There is no time to waste."Correction: The area surveyed for this study took place off the coast of Palau. The marine sanctuary is located farther offshore. Scientists believe their findings in protected areas near Palau's populated regions mean the reserve will yield positive results.",
"Capping a week of 100th anniversary celebrations for the National Park Service, President Barack Obama on Friday turned to the ocean to create the largest protected area anywhere on Earth—a half-million-square-mile arc of remote Pacific waters known for both exceptional marine life and importance to native Hawaiian culture.The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, established in 2006 by President George W. Bush, already covered 140,000 square miles of ocean around the uninhabited northwestern islands of Hawaii, Obama’s home state. (Learn about the name and how to pronounce it.)Obama more than quadrupled Papahānaumokuākea’s size, to 582,578 square miles, an area larger than all the national parks combined. Using his executive authority under the U.S. Antiquities Act, he extended most of the monument’s boundary—and its prohibition of commercial fishing—out to the 200-mile limit of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ).(Read about a monument established this week in the Maine woods.)Hawaii governor David Ige remarked on the “tremendous” debate within Hawaii over the monument and its fishing exclusion. But in the end, he said, the expansion “strikes the right balance at this time for the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands, and it can be a model for sustainability in the other oceans of planet Earth.”Papahānaumokuākea is a sanctuary for endangered species, including blue whales, short-tailed albatrosses, sea turtles, and the last Hawaiian monk seals. It contains some of the world’s northernmost and healthiest coral reefs, considered among the most likely to survive in an ocean warmed by climate change. The seamounts and sunken islands of its deeper waters are inhabited by more than 7,000 species, including the oldest animals on Earth—black corals that have lived for more than 4,000 years.In all, a quarter of the creatures living in the monument are found nowhere else. Many more have not yet been identified—such as a ghostly little white octopus, recently discovered, that scientists have dubbed Casper.Midway Atoll is one of several islands surrounded by the expanded monument.Marine biologist Sylvia Earle, a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, said Obama’s announcement buoys hope that the United States can lead the way to a global network of marine-protected areas large enough to save and restore the oceans. These “blue parks,” as Earle calls them, “are not a luxury – a place to go and have a good time,” she said. “Resilience to climate change is dependent upon having significant areas of natural protection—for biodiversity and for all the things that hold the planet steady. This is vitally important to protect our life-support system.”This announcement came on the eve of the World Conservation Congress, when leaders will meet to discuss preserving the planet.Laysan albatross juveniles congregate on a lagoon on Midway Atoll, in the protected waters of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.Some marine scientists and conservationists argue that fishing, mining, and other types of exploitation should be prohibited in at least 30 percent of the oceans to protect sea life and the benefits it provides humanity. With the expansion, the U.S. now has some 1,200 marine protected areas covering 26 percent of marine waters, said Lauren Wenzel, director of NOAA’s National Marine Protected Areas Center. But the majority allow fishing or some other form of resource extraction.The Papahānaumokuākea expansion increases the portion of “no-take” areas from 3 percent to 13 percent of U.S. marine waters. Almost all of that protected ocean—more than 98 percent—is in Papahānaumokuākea.A male Hawaiian monk seal, an endangered species, races after a potential mate near an undersea pinnacle at French Frigate Shoals.Despite popular proposals to protect some of the last great troves of marine biodiversity in the East, such as Cashes Ledge in the Gulf of Maine, or the canyons and seamounts off New England’s continental shelf, so far no marine monument has been created in the Atlantic Ocean. The history and power of the 400-year-old New England fishing industry make that a more difficult political challenge, said Robin Kundis Craig, a University of Utah law professor who specializes in the oceans. “Some of this is protecting what’s easier,” Craig said of the Papahānaumokuākea expansion.Citing that imbalance and the impact to Hawaii's longline fleet, the fishing industry vigorously fought the Papahānaumokuākea expansion—in TV ads and YouTube videos, in town hall meetings and in the capitols in Washington and Honolulu. Ultimately, support from Hawaii lawmakers helped cinch the president’s decision. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz brokered a compromise that maintained the monument’s existing boundary on its far eastern end, allowing fishermen from Kauai and Niihau to continue working their traditional grounds inside the EEZ.Edwin Ebisui Jr., chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, isn’t happy with the compromise. He and leaders of the seven other councils that manage regional fisheries along the U.S. coastline all wrote to President Obama to urge that they be allowed to continue managing fisheries in any monuments created under the Antiquities Act.But the longliners who once fished for tuna inside the newly expanded Papahānaumokuākea will now have to stop. Although the name of the monument is meant to honor Native Hawaiian culture, which considers the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands sacred, Ebisui sees the expansion as a blow to that culture. “To the native Hawaiian, access to marine resources is very, very important and always will be,” he said. “I don’t see how quadrupling the size of the prohibited fishing area in any way furthers their cultural interests.""With so much of our EEZ off-limits, it feels as if Hawaiians are taking it for the team again,” Ebisui said, referring to the long history of reserves established on and around the Hawaiian Islands, by Democratic and Republican presidents alike.Although the Antiquities Act was signed into law in 1906 by a Republican president, Theodore Roosevelt, the modern GOP has drawn a bead on it. Obama has so far created 25 national monuments, some as small as individual buildings. (Read about a large monument he established in New Mexico.) The Republican platform adopted at the party convention this summer in Cleveland calls for a change in the law to require monuments to be approved by both Congress and state legislatures.But the power of the Antiquities Act, said historian Douglas Brinkley, author of environmental biographies of both Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, lies in its ability to transcend industrial or regional influence to protect lands and waters of overarching interest to all Americans. “Presidents in their last year of office need to do what’s visionary,” Brinkley said. “It’s not about ‘what I can get in the last year.’ It’s about the long-term, which is the essence of conservation.” (Read the Act; it's only a page long.)Being inside a national monument doesn't protect Laysan Island from trash washing ashore, especially on its windward side.When Congress passed the Antiquities Act, the focus was on preserving southwestern prehistoric sites such as burial mounds and cliff-dwellings. By the time Teddy Roosevelt left office less than three years later, however, he had used his new privilege to protect 18 national monuments, and they included iconic landscapes such as Mount Olympus in Washington and Muir Woods in California as well as archeological sites. One of Roosevelt’s designations was the Grand Canyon. At the time, its protection was vehemently opposed by locals who called the area “strictly mineral country.”Follow Cynthia Barnett on Twitter.",
"The nearly 170,000 square miles of ocean around Ascension Island, one of the world’s most pristine and biodiverse ocean ecosystems, will soon be officially protected.From the surface, Ascension Island—a tiny volcanic outpost in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean between Brazil and the west coast of Africa—looks remote and isolated.But the small island is perched on the summit of a 10,000-foot underwater volcano in the mid-Atlantic ridge, one of the world’s longest mountain ranges.On August 24, the Ascension Island government announced plans to turn its national waters into a marine protected area, and today, the U.K. government announced plans to set aside 7 million pounds ($8.5 million) for marine conservation.A portion of that money is expected to go toward maintaining the Ascension Island MPA, which costs an estimated 150,000 pounds per year to maintain. The total protected area is nearly twice the size of the entire U.K. and larger than the state of California.(This is how Ascension Island could help us colonize other planets.)The U.K. government has not yet provided a breakdown of what the budget will be, and the MPA will not officially go into effect until it does. (A response from the U.K. government had not been provided by the time of this article’s publication.)“We’re 90 percent there,” says Adrian Gahan, policy director for the Blue Marine Foundation. The group also worked with National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project, an initiative to protected 20 of the ocean's wildest places by 2020. Ascension Island will be the 22nd marine reserve Pristine Seas has helped create.“The local community has asked for it. The U.K. government in principle has said they’ll pay for it. The technology is available. All that’s left is for the U.K. government to put in writing a commitment to fund the MPA,” he says.In question is a vast underwater deep-sea ecosystem with a rich abundance of marine species.A 2017 Pristine Seas expedition to assess the species richness of the Ascension Island national waters left expedition leader Paul Rose so in awe he could barely decide which species to list off first. Rarely seen sharks, migratory tuna, and then undiscovered species of plankton were all spotted.“It’s unbelievably beautiful,” he says, “and the abundance of marine life is just amazing.”To be out at sea and know a vast mountain range lurks below, “feels energetic, beautiful, and powerful,” he adds.The new MPA will close the area off from commercial fishing and extractive mining industries. Experts say MPAs help keep essential fish populations well stocked. They can lead to what’s called a “spillover effect,” in which thriving fish numbers inside an MPA lead to more abundant fisheries in regions where commercial fishing is legal.“There’s no doubt—for humans to survive, we’re going to continue to want and need protein from the sea,” says Rose. “Marine protected areas mean more fish for everybody.”The U.K. government is advocating for 30 percent of the world’s oceans to be protected by 2030, and the UN is fast approaching its deadline to protect 10 percent of the world’s oceans by 2020.Charles Darwin was fascinated with this unique geologic formation and named it Devil's Riding School.Marine protected areas have previously faced criticism for being what are called “paper parks,” declared on paper but not actually monitored or enforced.Gahan is optimistic that the Ascension MPA can be a model for successful marine conservation, in part because the reserve was negotiated with buy-in from local residents. The island is home to under 1,000 people, most of whom work on the island’s military base or local commerce. No indigenous populations are present.The MPA will be enforced largely with satellite monitoring.“Many years ago, the only way we could monitor illegal activity was spotter aircraft or fishery patrol vessels,” says Rose. “Now we do have very effective satellite monitoring.”The 150,000 pounds needed to maintain the MPA each year will go toward a small monitoring staff, patrol vessel, and patrol trips.“If the U.K. government fails to pay, it will fall into being a paper park quite quickly. You wouldn’t have the staff, and the boat, and the infrastructure to enforce it,” cautions Gahan.",
"A view from Air Force One of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Pacific Ocean. Former President Barack Obama expanded the ocean reserve to be the largest marine protected area in 2016.You can think of a marine protected area like a boost of vitamin C taken at the onset of a cold. It may not cure you, but it can help you bounce back.“A [protected] ecosystem tends to be more resistant to disturbance and it's more resilient—it comes back faster,” says Jane Lubchenco, now a marine ecologist at Oregon State University and formerly the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “It's not unlike your body. If you are immunocompromised, you're much more likely to come down with a cold or flu.”These protected ocean spaces, when defended well, won't solve all the problems in the world's oceans, but they might give us a fighting chance against afflictions like climate change or overfishing. Studies have shown that completely closing a portion of the ocean off to activities like fishing and drilling helps keep wildlife populations healthy and increases biodiversity.They also make headlines—declaring MPAs has been a growing trend in the past two decades, in part because the U.N. member countries are nearing a 2020 deadline to protect 10 percent of the world's oceans. It's a target unlikely to be met. The U.N. says that just under six percent of the world's oceans are protected, but one study published last March found that number is closer to 3.6 percent if you remove regions that have only been declared without any real changes.So why are countries falling short of the goals they say are critical to meet? And what makes an MPA so necessary in the first place?Exactly what people mean when they refer to a region as a marine protected area is unclear and often debated, sometimes hotly—and that's part of the problem, says Lubchenco.“The lack of clarity around what 'MPA' means causes a lot of confusion,” she says, noting governments can't expect the same benefits from protected areas with looser protections. “What you get depends on what's allowed.”Inl February of this year the International Union for the Conservation of Nature—a global organization responsible for classifying species as extinct, endangered, threatened, etc.—published a set of standards outlining that an MPA is a region managed explicitly for conservation. The standards served to reinforce long-standing management principles that may have been ignored or not known.Often, individual countries to set their own standards. Even with the IUCN guidelines, an MPA can refer to anything from a region that's completely closed to a region that allows some commercial fishing.“MPAs are not a panacea. They're not going to solve everything,” says Lubchenco. “But they're a powerful and underutilized tool.”A study published in 2017 in the Journal of Marine Science found that no-take marine protected areas yield higher quantities of fish and more ecological diversity. For those who fish on the perimeters of MPAs, the spillover is lucrative.They won't prevent climate change from occurring, but MPAs may help ecosystems bounce back after the effects of climate change are felt. But just how much they help is a matter of some scientific debate.In a study published last May in the journal Nature Climate Change, University of North Carolina biologist John Bruno found that even MPAs won't be able to weather warming temperatures and other impacts of climate change.“MPAs are in big trouble until we tackle warming,” says Bruno. “To tackle climate change, we just have to reduce emissions. The science suggests really the only thing we can do is mitigate CO2 emissions.”Bruno is skeptical that MPAs can offer climate change resilience. He believes the biggest benefits are that different species are allowed to survive and grow in number, thus increasing biodiversity.Lubcheno, however, thinks this biodiversity is exactly what could boost regions that do feel the pinch from climate change.“As we are radically changing ocean ecosystems, the more sources of genetic variety we have, the most likely it is to be suited to a new climate,” says Lubchenco. She gives the example that some species of coral are heat tolerant, meaning they don't bleach and whither away like many other coral species do when subjected to warmer waters.“We know there's genetic diversity for thermal tolerance, and the hope is some genotypes will make it through the bottleneck of these warmer waters. If you protected those in an MPA, it's more likely that those will become more important,” she adds.In other words, when (not if) the ocean warms, MPAs may be the best chance at preserving the genetic material that can weather warmer waters.The world is already expected to fail at meeting its ocean conservation targets by 2020—so what happens next?Lubchenco says policymakers need to recognize four protection levels, from fully safeguarded areas that don't allow any sort of human take like fishing or mining, to areas that are only minimally protected and allow commercial activity. Clarifying the type of MPA, she says, will help determine what the benefits will be and how the parks are enforced.Scientists are also trying to figure out where they can get the biggest bang of their buck.Should MPAs be established in areas at high risk of environmental damage, or is protection more effective in already pristine environments, for example.A group of ecologists, climate scientists, economists, and data scientists from National Geographic's Pristine Seas initiative are beginning an ambitious project to map exactly where and when the world should create more. (Lubcheno is among those contributing to the effort.)They'll look at environmental hot spots than can help create tangible benefits like biodiversity, food availability from fisheries, and climate change resilience.Convening the group is National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala, who says, “Success for this project is to come up with a map with areas that, if preserved, will save the life in the ocean, will help us produce food, and will help us mitigate climate change.”After knowing where to place MPAs, Sala and his research team plan to take their findings to local governments in the hopes that it will help inform policy.A meeting to kick off the initiative was held in April, and the group plans to publish their findings in a scientific journal by summer of next year.It's a massive effort that the team hopes will ultimately help protect parts of the ocean that are imperiled by human activity.Lubcheno points out that much of the technology that allowed industries to fish or drill for oil in far places were developed after WWII. She sees establishing MPAs as taking the ocean back to the way it existed before humans roamed the high seas with such abandon.“The ocean used to be a de facto MPA,” she adds. “We need to re-establish protected areas because we got things out of balance.”",
"Ascension IslandTouching down here feels like landing on Mars.Clay-colored lava rocks form football field-sized craters visible from my airplane window. Residences near the airfield are low-slung, white, and identical in shape, just like the space colonies in science fiction. There are 800 or so mostly British and U.S. citizens residing on this 33 square-mile island, which sits just south of the equator, about half way between South America and Africa. Hundreds of satellites pepper the craters, listening to U.S. test missiles, space junk, and things that are classified.I deboard the military charter plane and walk down the U.S. Air Force’s Wideawake Airfield under a cloudless sky. I am over 1,000 miles from any continent. It’s hard to imagine that scientists from another century chose to build the planet’s first artificial ecosystem here.Naturally treeless, Green Mountain once provided a strategic viewpoint to monitor passing ships. Today, a thick forest of alien trees obscures the view.Rock and blinding sun overpower my senses. While waiting with two-dozen fellow civilians for passport stamps, Lyndon Smith, an elderly British visitor, points to the tripod slung across my shoulders.“She once wept here,” he says quietly, pointing toward his wife. “There’s no release from the sun. Are you out here to take pictures?” I nod in response.Charles Darwin popularized the stigma about Ascension Island that Smith and many others are repeating almost 200 years later. Darwin called the island “hideous.” He stopped here en route to England from the lush Galapagos on his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle. Darwin lamented in his journal that this inhospitable place occupied by the British military should be made into a “productive spot.” Darwin called the landscape “burnt” and “completely destitute of trees.” To be fair, there was one solitary tree.If Galapagos was Charles Darwin’s Eden, Ascension was his Inferno.Darwin developed names to describe the island’s inferno-like rock formations: Devil’s Riding School, Devil’s Ashpit, and Broken Tooth. Those names have stuck. I pick up a hand-drawn driving map in the open-air immigration area. I count six roads, forty-four volcanic peaks, and five features still containing the word “devil.”I walk toward a concrete patio filled with strewn baggage when a sliver of green reaching over 2,000 feet in height catches the corner of my eye. The peak stands in stark contrast to the Mars-like landscape around me. This artificially green mountaintop is the reason I’d come. I’d spent months wondering: What can we learn from this place?Despite being visited by only a few thousand people each year, this mountain has become the poster child for “human-made” or “novel” ecosystems worldwide. The aptly named Green Mountain is one of the most cited and debated examples for the phenomena of wholly new combinations of species, with no historical equivalent, that assemble through human intervention.If we indeed want to figure out how to green Mars and settle there, this mountaintop forest surrounded by a volcanic moonscape is our scientific starting point.For most of the 1800s and 1900s, Ascension Island's teaming population of seabirds was decimated by the invasion of cats. By the time the cats were eradicated in the 2000s, this colony of sooty terns near the U.S. Air Force's Wideawake Airfield was a rare hold out.Darwin first suggested engineering a new environment on Ascension. But Sir Joseph Hooker, a younger Victorian-era botanist, would take action. He embarked on a fifty-year experiment that would disrupt the island’s landscape and ecology. Archivists would later find in Hooker’s journal that, as an old man, he expressed regret for the whole endeavor. He predicted the tragic impact it would have a century later.Sir Joseph Hooker, the architect of Ascension's transformationYoung Hooker was eager, in 1843, to make his mark on science after years of sleeping with Darwin’s manuscripts under his pillow. He shipped 330 plants from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew to Green Mountain before the middle of the century. By 1870, 5,000 more trees had been planted. Anecdotal records report that greater rainfall soon followed these plantings (a point disputed by lack of reliable weather measurement).With time, the soil changed, as did the island’s hydrology. The Royal Admiralty, the project’s early financiers, reported conditions more hospitable for its troops stationed on Ascension Island. All thanks to the plants.I visit Ascension’s famous Dew Pond. By the 1880s, Hooker’s “mist-catching trees” had formed a small pond at the mountain’s summit, the island’s first freshwater water body. Today, bamboo trunks form a 40-foot tall wall around the pond, knocking together harmoniously in the breeze.A life-sized, plastic crocodile waits half-submerged in the pond with teeth showing. The faux reptile appeared there in the 1990s as a gag. It quickly developed its own mythology among the military residents. Should they remove the item? Or leave it? No one can agree what to do with it now. The same can be said about the artificial ecosystem all around.Hiking down from the pond, along the ridge of Green Mountain, I notice striking similarities between the lush forest around me and the “natural” cloud forests I’d visited in Costa Rica. Scientists deemed the biological transformation on Ascension’s peak so unprecedented that, in the late 1990s, they borrowed a term from science fiction—terraforming—just to describe what was happening.Newly digitized letters reveal the remarkable extent of Hooker’s experiment. Sparrows, chaffinches, linnets, and several coastal African birds arrived to the island in 1863. Orchards of oranges, lemons, cherimoyers, custard apples, and lychees were planted by 1868. But not everything flourished. The orange trees withered. Hooker’s botanical plantings waned into the 1890s and only the fittest non-native plants survived. The surviving mash-up of flora from Africa and the Americas ran untended for most of the 1900s.Monkey Rock Cemetery contains the graves of mostly infants and toddlers who did not survive the remote, inhopsitable conditions of Ascension Island during the 18th and 19th centuries.The experiment became a historical footnote. But in the early 2000s it resurfaced smack in the middle of a new scientific vocabulary around “novel ecosystems.” What long-term value do human-made ecosystems have, whether intentional or accidental? How do they work?As plans advance for human settlements on Mars, more and more people seek answers from this mountain. For example, in 2004, evolutionary biologist David Wilkinson used Green Mountain to illustrate that snail-speed coevolution is not always necessary for complex ecosystems to build themselves. Sometimes things can happen quickly, chaotically, by just fitting together.Terraforming Mars may require evolutionary insights like this about random species assembling, competing, and cooperating in strange, new places.Novel ecosystems are popping up around the globe on terms much more accidental than Green Mountain. One researcher estimated that up to 35 percent of undeveloped lands near cities and farms may soon be covered with these novel systems.Morning sun lights Green Mountain as viewed from Elliot's Pass, looking south toward the U.S. Air Force buildings at Wideawake Airfield.In 2008, Dox Sax of Brown University co-authored a paper that found plant diversity had doubled on five remote islands and island chains because of accidental biological invasions. Yet almost no extinctions of local plants and animals had occurred. Sax believes Green Mountain is therefore “at the nexus of issues we’ll all be wrestling with for years to come: novel as opposed to historic communities, the role of non-natives in providing ecosystem services, and what our conservation goals should be.”Sax believes evolutionary relationships are forming atop Green Mountain that could be wholly different from ones that work on long timelines in “pristine” places. Pristine place are where scientists traditionally flock.Dan Simberloff of the University of Tennessee says that studying Ascension Island could help us learn not just about Mars, but also how to green Earth’s deserts and feed more people. He and Sax agree that more research is needed on novel ecosystems. Yet neither of the men has managed a research trip to Ascension Island. Non-military travel to the island is expensive. Accommodations are limited. Unlike the Galapagos, where evolutionary biologists arrive in the hundreds each year, visiting scientists are generally a rarity on Green Mountain.Stedson Stroud, with nothing more than an 8th grade education, knows more about Ascension’s plant life than anyone today. He picked up where Hooker left off.Stroud always carries a walking stick and ties his hair back in a long, curly ponytail. Stroud came to this island as a teenager in the early 1960s. He has seen the island change. A descendent of Chinese, African, and Indian laborers, he is a “Saint”—someone born on Ascension’s much-larger sister island of St. Helena. He points to a sign for Old NASA Road on our first drive together to Green Mountain.Naturalist Stedson Stroud searches for non-native birds species in the invasive African grasses that blanket the high elevations of Green Mountain.“I was the janitor when they were relaying the first Apollo radio transmissions from this island,” he says. “My job was to keep the coffee supplied throughout the night.” He smiles behind a thick, black mustache.We stop at the Royal Air Force base for snacks and water. Desalinated water spouts from the fountains and Mars bars pile next to the register. Green Mountain’s orchard and dew pond no longer serve the basic survival needs of residents.We roar up thirty switchbacks in Stroud’s canvas-top Jeep with a faded decal on the side. It reads: Conservation Department. The air gets noticeably cooler. On average, Green Mountain is 7°C cooler than where resident live in the lowlands. Wild sheep and bright orange land crabs dart to the banks.“The sheep look thin,” I comment. “They look healthier than earlier this year,” says Stroud. In addition to being Green Mountain National Park’s only ranger when I visited, Stroud is considered the island’s unofficial veterinarian. I would soon learn that those two jobs are at odds here on Ascension Island.Ascension Island residents Jeff and Carla Smith raised "Chloe" the sheep as a pet after rescuing it from certain death. They keep the invasive animal away from sensitive areas of the island.When a wild lamb was found motherless in 2015, Stroud recruited two island residents, Carla and Jeff Smith, to take her in. Chloe is now a grown sheep that lives very much like a dog. She roams inside a fenced yard, drinks filtrated water from a bottle, and rides in the back seat of a BMW. Chloe isn’t alone. There is a nascent but growing culture of feral donkey and sheep “adoptions” among the residents as the community and invasive animals try to survive together in this harsh environment. Besides, it’s better that way for the plants found only on Ascension.I follow Stroud to the restoration site of Euphorbia origanoides, a diminutive shrub on the brink of extinction. It’s miles away and only accessible by foot. We pass sandy beaches pocketed by last night’s laying of turtle eggs. Seawater spouts over 15 feet in the air, like a geyser, through a unique coastal rock formation. I spot a dozen sea turtle heads bobbing in the turquoise surf.After a mile of barren lowlands, we near a fenced paddock. I spot a handful of tire-sized rock circles on the ground. One is shaped like a heart. At the center of each is a stump, grazed to an inch from the ground. They are the mourned remains of a once hopeful out-planting of Euphorbia origanoides. Inside the paddock, the plants are still safe from sheep and rabbits.A masked booby, Sula dactylatra, and chick face each other with White Hill in the background.Non-native sheep, much like the island’s non-native plants, threaten the things Stroud cares most about: the island’s last surviving endemic plants.Ten plants discovered by Hooker and colleagues are found only on this island. Three are now thought to be extinct. Outmuscled by Hooker’s plants and sailors’ livestock, the remaining seven are among the most threatened plants in the world. “We’re in a race against time,” says Stroud.I ask Stroud to show me the place and plant he calls “the loves of my life.” It takes a half hour of sliding on our buttocks down steep banks blanketed by meter-tall African grasses.Stroud bounds ahead. I and two part-time park volunteers from the U.S. Air Force base slog behind, sore and muddy. Stroud walks to a rocky pinnacle and hands me a fraying nylon rope. We do a repelling-like leap to a ledge that, clearly, no sheep can reach. He points to seven tiny individuals, about the size of a four-leaf clover, of the once-lost Annogramma ascensionis—the Ascension Island parsley fern.This rocky pinnacle is the site where Stedson Stroud (pictured here) in 2012 rediscovered the edemnic Ascension parsely fern, Anogramma ascensionis, not seen since the 19th century.Stroud made international headlines in 2009 when he rediscovered the last three individuals of this species at this very site. Since then, almost a million dollars has been collectively invested in cultivating and reintroducing a viable population.“It was better than finding gold,” says Stroud. Biodiversity aside, the plant had political value.Green Mountain had long been evoked among scientists as a talking point about evolution. History buffs would visit for its historical affiliation with Darwin and terraforming. Finding the extinct Ascension Island parsley fern shifted the conversation about this novel ecosystem towards topics of conservation and renewal.A team of explorers scans the island for native plants.Both Hooker and Stroud are conflicted botanists. Hooker predicted—and regretted—the extinction of Ascension’s unique ferns, which he saw as vital keys to our understanding of island evolution. Stroud stewards the terraformed landscape while simultaneously investing in heavy-handed management projects to save the remaining endemic species. He references their cultural value to South Atlantic islanders.The island has one endemic bird, the Ascension frigatebird, which was saved from near extinction after a multi-million dollar, decade-long effort that eradicated feral cats from the island. I ask Stroud if he favors a similar effort for Green Mountain. Perhaps mow down the forest and focus wholly on traditional conservation of endemics plants.Stroud pauses, “At this point, I fear we’ve too far gone for [that]. We need to focus on coexistence.”Green Mountain’s shady slopes have only one residence, a stately concrete mansion reserved for the Londoners who serve term positions as Island Administrator. A bride and groom borrow its manicured grounds for a wedding ceremony my last Saturday there. I watch the groom harvest non-native ginger leaves from the summit and decorate the alter. The wedding photographer poses the newlyweds in the shade with a lush, forested backdrop. Children in bright dresses jump off 200-year-old canons onto cool Bermuda grass.Silas "Jim" Reynolds of the U.K.'s South Birmingham University studies Ascension's wildlife.“How we think about non-native plants has changed in the past decade,” says Sax. “Drastically so.”Some scientists now say we ought to make peace with the novel ecosystems around us. And better understand what they provide us. Others, of course, push back.How do we reconcile the norms of traditional conservation and the reality around us? In the minds of Ascension Islanders, there seems to be little controversy.“If I could snap my fingers and return the mountain to its original state, would I? Probably not,” says Drew Avery, president of the Ascension Island Heritage Society. Avery argues that many island residents have no knowledge that the forested landscape on Green Mountain is not “natural”—the way things were before human beings arrived.There’s another reason why mowing down Green Mountain’s trees is off the table: some might be capable of rescuing the remaining endemic individuals being obliterated by the expanding forest.With a population around 800, weddings are rare on Ascension. Here, Tahirra Felton wed Aaron Rogers at the U.K. Administrator's Residence, which sits just below the summit of Green Mountain.Bullied out of their home rooted in the ground, the plants Pteris adscensionis and Xiphopteris ascensionense have found refuge in the novel ecosystem’s canopy. Thriving in the moist, sponge-like mosses that grow on the branches of the cape yew and white olive trees, a small population of ferns that spent thousands of years on the ground are popping up into the air. Are they actually adapting and thriving? It’s too early to tell.Stroud has turned traditional conservation on its head by facilitating the fern’s canopy survival hack in the cape yew trees. He’s planting more of the trees once considered so problematic. This strategy is unorthodox but showing promise. It is part of the island’s Biodiversity Action Plan designed in 2012 to reconcile with the changing landscape.After years as the first and only conservation officer, in 2016, Stroud worked as part of an eleven person, full-time conservation staff. The team includes Ascension native Natasha Williams and a younger generation of Saints, like Jolene Sim, who left St. Helena like Stroud to start a life on Ascension. Their traditional knowledge of St. Helena’s plants has found a new, urgent use on this South Atlantic sister island.“We grew up and are used to the terrain that is here and St. Helena, so it’s quite natural for us to be walking on these [cliffs] and be clambering about,” says Sim, the deputy head of conservation who has been working on a massive repopulation effort of the once-lost Ascension parsley fern. In February of 2015, the clambering paid off.Sim and a collaborator from Kew Royal Botanical Gardens discovered 170 new sporophytes—the next generation of parsley ferns—on a rocky ledge where they had placed their hopes. She had also placed, with tweezers, seven nursery-reared ferns months earlier.The land crab Johngarthia lagostoma is restricted to the slopes of Green Mountain, where there is sufficient moisture and vegetation. This crab is found on only four islands in the Southern Atlantic Ocean.“We were surprised,” Sims recalls. “We didn’t expect such big success from just seven initial plants.”This kind of reintroduction is a more traditional approach to plant restoration than Stroud’s canopy creation. But both are part of a larger portfolio approach to biodiversity conservation that the on-island staff has spent years developing in collaboration with off-island scientists.Theirs is a do-what-you-can-and-see-what-works strategy that seems to be helping a conservation landscape where, seemingly, few ecological rules apply.Together, Sim and Stroud picked out this ledge on a steep, mist-covered cliff where the descendants of nursery-reared parsley ferns now attempt a species come back. Conservation Department staff commonly refer to this spot as Stedson’s Ledge.“It’s nice to have my name there,” comments Stroud, who was about to turn 70 years old when I visited. “But, really, it will be Jolene and the others who will continue this fight for our endemic plants long after I’m gone.”On my last day on Ascension Island, the mist that had perpetually covered the summit of Green Mountain momentarily lifts. Five U.S. Air Force airmen and airwomen arrive in casual clothes with a visiting sergeant. They walk down the muddy path to a fenced area where Stroud is waiting, two shovels in hand. To commemorate the sergeant’s visit, Stroud has invited him to plant a ceremonial tree to contribute to this effort of creating a large cape yew canopy, where the last endemic ferns might persist. The sergeant lifts the sapling from the pot and kneels down. Photos are snapped.To me, it’s a strange sight. The purposeful planting of non-native trees, just like Hooker did, is an act that got us all into this whole novel ecosystem mess centuries ago. Is this the right path forward for Green Mountain—or for other novel ecosystems?After the planting, Stroud and I are alone. The mist begins to roll back over the mountaintop.Green Mountain has become a metaphor, parable, and talking point for scientists. Among conservationists, it’s used to debate ethics. But few people ask Stroud, the daily caretaker, what this place teaches him about the future direction of conservation. So I ask.“I am now extending Hooker’s forest, of large mist-interception trees, as a survival tactic for these ferns to grow on,” he says. “If we stand by and do nothing, then we will be rightly condemned by future generations.”Stroud picks a few wild but non-native raspberries. He hands them to me as we walk back toward his Jeep. They’re tart and delicious.I scribble in my notepad on our ride down the mountain: “If you can’t save everything the way it used to be, save what you can the way it is now.”Reporting for this story was supported by a grant from the Fund for Environmental Journalism, a program of the Society for Environmental Journalists.Author’s note: Stedson Stroud retired from the Conservation Department in May 2016. He has since returned to his native island where he continues to look for the two lost plant species of St. Helena. Jolene Sim now leads plant conservation efforts on Ascension Island.",
"The small nation of Palau is the size of New York City, but its marine reserve is the size of California. Palau’s most famous tourist attraction is a lake filled with jellyfish on Eil Malk island. Snorkeling among the jellies is generally considered safe because their stings are too weak to be felt by most people.The U.N. is nearing its decade-long goal of protecting 10 percent of the global ocean by 2020. But the world may fall short.Scientists agree that marine protected areas, or MPAs, are essential for environmental health: they ensure fishers have healthy stocks by preventing resource depletion; they protect endangered species; they make ecosystems more resistant to climate change; and they maintain biodiversity.At a U.N. conference held last June, the executive secretary for the Convention on Biological Diversity announced approximately 5.7 percent of the ocean was protected. But a new study published in Marine Policy paints a less optimistic picture.As of early 2018, only two years away from the U.N. target, the world is not even halfway there, according to the study. (The assessment was supported in part by the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project.)The scientists found that 5.7 percent figure also included regions that were in various stages of becoming marine protected areas (MPA). In some cases, the areas were simply being proposed. In others they were still under discussion and not fully approved."Calling an area that allows commercial fishing 'protected' is like calling a logging concession a 'protected forest.' It's worse than an euphemism; it's a lie," says Enric Sala, study author and National Geographic's Explorer-in-Residence who leads the Pristine Seas project.In their own assessment, researchers found only 3.6 of the ocean was in an implemented marine protected area and only two percent of the ocean was in an MPA that was entirely restricted access."MPA is king of a catch-all term. There are a lot of different categories within MPAs. It could be anything from a national marine sanctuary that may allow commercial fishing all the way down to full protection, which is completely closed to all destructive activities," says Kirsten Grorud-Colvert, an ecologist from Oregon State University and a study author.Completely closing off a region allows scientists to use it as an experimental control, she says. With that, they can better assess the damage to marine areas that remain subject to human influence."The data is overwhelmingly conclusive that positive effects happen when you close an area," she adds.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature sets international guidelines for MPAs. The IUCN's World Commission on Protected Areas then acts like a recording system of who is adhering to these guidelines and where. This information is documented in the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA)."The challenge is that the WDPA has to report whatever countries report," she says. "It may be that they announce [an MPA], but they're really early on [in the process]. That's part of what's leading to some of the challenges in accurately accessing how much of the ocean is protected."As a remedy, the paper suggests that more transparency and accountability could help these large international organizations sift publicity stunts from tangible conservation."Countries are rushing to 'achieve' their commitments, and many countries...are already cheating and claiming protection, but they are not really protecting new areas," says Sala. "The world must not accept bogus claims. They will not bring back marine life."Grorud-Colvert notes that raising the current two percent of protection to eight percent in only two years likely won't happen. But if all the proposed areas actually do become implemented, 7.3 percent of the ocean would be protected.Echoing Grorud-Colvert is one of her fellow study authors."My personal view is that we're not likely to make it," says Rashid Sumaila, an environment economist from the University of British Columbia. "If we don't even hit 10 percent, we're far away from what we need."Thirty percent, he notes, is the real amount of protection scientists agree should be implemented in the ocean. The U.N. goal to reach 10 percent was a baby step to get there.To understand why more countries haven't acted to create MPAs, Sumaila says you have to look at the economics of marine conservation.In remote regions—take Midway Atoll, the first U.S. MPA created under the Obama administration, for example—fishing is not a widescale operation.In regions that do have massive fishing industries, establishing an MPA is more difficult.A study published last month showed industrial fishing alone occupies more than half the global ocean, so conflict with the fishing industry and conservationists is a frequent source of friction."They want to front load the benefits," he says of governments resistant to implementing MPAs. "In fishing communities life is hard. Income is generally low already."Subsidies, he suggests, are one way to ease the burden. Distributed efficiently, he says his own economic data has showed countries will receive a return on investment in the long-term."It's possible biologically and economically," Sumaila adds. "The question is how do you organize it."Correction: A previous version of this article stated the World Commission on Protected Areas is administered by the U.N. It is administered by the IUCN.",

"Reduce the effects of climate change on the ocean by leaving the car at home when you can and being conscious of your energy use at home and work. A few things you can do to get started today: Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs, take the stairs, and bundle up or use a fan to avoid oversetting your thermostat.Global fish populations are rapidly being depleted due to demand, loss of habitat, and unsustainable fishing practices. When shopping or dining out, help reduce the demand for overexploited species by choosing seafood that is both healthful and sustainable.Plastics that end up as ocean debris contribute to habitat destruction and entangle and kill tens of thousands of marine animals each year. To limit your impact, carry a reusable water bottle, store food in nondisposable containers, bring your own cloth tote or other reusable bag when shopping, and recycle whenever possible.Whether you enjoy diving, surfing, or relaxing on the beach, always clean up after yourself. Explore and appreciate the ocean without interfering with wildlife or removing rocks and coral. Go even further by encouraging others to respect the marine environment or by participating in local beach cleanups.Certain products contribute to the harming of fragile coral reefs and marine populations. Avoid purchasing items such as coral jewelry, tortoiseshell hair accessories (made from hawksbill turtles), and shark products.Read pet food labels and consider seafood sustainability when choosing a diet for your pet. Never flush cat litter, which can contain pathogens harmful to marine life. Avoid stocking your aquarium with wild-caught saltwater fish, and never release any aquarium fish into the ocean or other bodies of water, a practice that can introduce non-native species harmful to the existing ecosystem.Many institutes and organizations are fighting to protect ocean habitats and marine wildlife. Find a national organization and consider giving financial support or volunteering for hands-on work or advocacy. If you live near the coast, join up with a local branch or group and get involved in projects close to home.Research the ocean policies of public officials before you vote or contact your local representatives to let them know you support marine conservation projects. Consider patronizing restaurants and grocery stores that offer only sustainable seafood, and speak up about your concerns if you spot a threatened species on the menu or at the seafood counter.Practice responsible boating, kayaking, and other recreational activities on the water. Never throw anything overboard, and be aware of marine life in the waters around you. If you’re set on taking a cruise for your next vacation, do some research to find the most eco-friendly option.All life on Earth is connected to the ocean and its inhabitants. The more you learn about the issues facing this vital system, the more you’ll want to help ensure its health—then share that knowledge to educate and inspire others.",
"Michaela Skovranova jokes that her first underwater photograph was actually made through a glass tank at an aquarium.While Skovranova was a university student, the Australia-based photographer worked as an education officer at Wildlife Sydney. Her job often required that she work at SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium, based in the city’s Darling Harbour. On those days, Skovranova would arrive to the aquarium early, at six or seven in the morning, and wander around with her camera. “I wondered what it would be like to swim with the animals and to document them,” she says.Her favorite animals to photograph at the aquarium were the fur seals. She recalls how engaged they were with her, staring back when she’d look at them through the glass. She’d watch as they played with one another in the water. As soon she’d walk away, she’d notice they would stop.In 2017, Skovranova traveled to Antarctica for the first time. An algae bloom made for limited visibility and poor conditions, she says, but it was still among the most magical trips she’s taken. “Antarctica takes time and patience to do it justice,” she explains. “It is a very special place.”“They really connected to [me], and I connected to them,” Skovranova says.Skovranova moved to Australia from Slovakia, a landlocked country in Europe, when she was 13. She wasn’t a strong swimmer—she still isn’t, she says modestly—and at first she was scared of the ocean. The currents were strong, and she didn’t know how to navigate the waves. But she developed a deep affinity for the water, a lifelong affair made stronger by her curiosity and creativity—and her camera.Australian sea lions, an endangered species, frolic in the waters around Hopkins Island in South Australia. By photographing in shallow waters, Skovranova is able to use primarily natural light in her images. She tries to dive with as little equipment as possible.“I fell in love with the ocean because I feel much more present when I’m in the water,” Skovranova says. “There’s a feeling of weightlessness and a certain level of sound and sensory deprivation that I feel. When I’m in the ocean, nothing else exists.”It was in 2014 when Skovranova took a big step in her relationship with the water by jumping into underwater photography. Since then, she has traveled across Australia, Tonga, and Antarctica documenting life just below the ocean’s surface, and she uses as little equipment as possible to do so. Though she has her scuba certification, Skovranova prefers free diving, or what she also calls breath-hold—being in or under water while holding one’s breath. Because of the wildlife she documents and the depths at which she works, Skovranova says breath-hold is a “natural addition” to her process; it allows the surrounding elements to guide and influence her.A turtle glides through the ocean. “What I like to do [when I go out to photograph] is get as ready as possible and then just jump in and leave [the rest] up to the elements,” Skovranova explains.“I love to collaborate with nature,” Skovranova explains. She concentrates on shallow waters, staying within the first 30 feet from the surface and channeling what natural light is available instead of using strobe lighting. Staying closer to the surface also makes much of what she documents—whales and sea lions included—more accessible for people to experience. “You can truly see how complex these creatures are: they talk to each other, they love, they cry, and they sing, just like we do,” she says.Still, she likes to leave a little bit to the imagination.“I don’t want to show everything, and I don’t want the images to be too clean or too perfect,” Skovranova explains. “I want all the specks of light and plankton and everything that mixes in the water to be there to really show how much it changes day to day or hour by hour.”She also hopes her photos demonstrate how special our relationship is to the water, particularly to those for whom the ocean is “out of sight, out of mind.”Penguins were meant to be one of Skovranova’s primary subjects during her time in Antarctica, but her trip ended up being different from what she expected. “It’s never what I think it is going to be,” she says. “I am a huge advocate of going out into varied conditions and challenging yourself.”“I would love for people far away to feel the presence of the ocean—to feel every drop—and to really create their own connections,” Skovranova says.",
"Illuminated only by a full moon, underwater photographer Michaela Skovranova and a group of divers parked in the Great Barrier Reef check the water around their boat for signs it's about to happen.Perched on the edge of the vessel, periodically they scoop up water about every 15 minutes. In these samples, they're looking for tiny, sticky eggs recently released from the gut cavities of coral. Sometimes the eggs will produce what looks like a red slick on the water's surface.When eggs finally turn up, it means a coral-spawning event is about to take place. When the divers see that, they quickly plunge into the water, in hopes of witnessing what can only be seen once a year, when waters are warm and the moon is full.Hermaphroditic corals reproduce during these spawning events by releasing both male and female reproductive cells, which are called gametes. When these cells float to the water's surface, they pair up and combine. Once fertilized, the eggs develop into larvae, which eventually turn into polyps, or new coral colonies.This process "is a leap of faith of nature," says Skovranova.Releasing millions of these reproductive cells at the same time increases the odds that eggs will become fertilized by male gametes from other individual corals, thus ensuring genetic diversity of the offspring. Because the event happens only once a year, divers must be careful not to interfere with the process when swimming through the reef. Shining bright light on coral can prevent a spawning event from happening, but once it's in progress, the corals are unbothered by light.To catch the spawning on camera, Skovranova dove into the darkness and tried to let her eyes adjust, instead of using a flashlight. Yet swimming through a dark reef can be risky. Much of the reef lies within enclaves where little light penetrates. Divers are careful not to injure the delicate coral or touch a crown of thorns, a large, poisonous species of starfish, that in cases of extreme allergic reactions can cause death.During a full coral spawning, so many eggs are released at once that the event is often likened to an underwater snowstorm. But when Skovranova was diving this year, she witnessed only a split spawning, which means only some of the corals were releasing their gametes at that time. Corals that were not participating were saving their cells for a spawning event at a later date, most likely sometime in December.Her photos of the reproductive event show how dense with eggs the waters can get, even when only some of the corals reproduce. Those eggs compete for space with a host of marine life, like zooplankton and clownfish.Coral spawning is a critical time of year for conservation scientists. It's during this time that coral eggs and sperm are collected to be studied and artificially grown in labs.Artificially raised corals are becoming an increasingly important conservation tool. In 2016 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef suffered massive coral bleaching events that damaged two thirds of the reef. Coral bleaching occurs when pollutants or abnormally warm water prompt coral to expel the algae that live symbiotically in their tissues, and which provide the polyps food through photosynthesis. When conditions don't improve, the algae don't return, and the corals eventually starve to death.One study published by the United Nations this summer predicted all the world's corals could die off in 30 years if nothing is done to curb globally warming waters. This could have far-reaching impacts, because corals aggregate to become some of the world's largest living organisms, and they provide critical habitat to a host of marine life, from fish to invertebrates.Scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science plan to study the coral cells collected during this year's spawning event to see how or if corals are adapting to warmer waters. There is some early indication that some corals are more resilient to warming than previously thought, giving some hope to conservationists.",
"Trash accumulated along the National Mall near the Washington Monument due to a partial shutdown of the federal government.National parks are America's public lands, but right now they're America's trashcans.That's because the U.S. federal government, embattled over funding for a border wall, has shut down, leaving national parks open and largely unattended. Since the shutdown began on December 21, brimming trashcans, overflowing toilets, and trespassing has been reported at many parks locations. On Sunday, the Department of the Interior announced they would be dipping into funds collected from entrance fees to pay for trash clean up, restroom maintenance, and additional law enforcement.In a response to that announcement, the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) cited fears that using entrance fees would divert badly needed funds from the park service’s massive $11 billion maintenance backlog.Just 117 of the more than 400 national parks collect fees, meaning hundreds will have to compete for funds the NPCA claims will not be enough. The NPS has not announced how much funding will go to each park.“Never before have I seen the federal government tempt fate in national parks the way we are today,” says Diane Regas, president of the Trust for Public Land of the decision to keep parks open with only a fraction of their employees. “It's not about what has happened already. It's about what could happen if you don't have the appropriate staffing.”According to the NPCA, staffing varies by park, but some 16,000 parks service employees have been furloughed since the shutdown began, leaving a small number active for policing and security.The government shut down three times in 2018, but only three days last January and less than a day that following February. As of Friday, the government had been partially shut down for 13 days.Before he left office, Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke issued a policy document in January 2018 that outlines how national parks should operate during a “lapse in appropriations,” such as a funding hold seen during shutdowns. Part of the reason for this was to help financially support the businesses that border national parks and derive a significant chunk of their revenue from park visits.“I would suggest it's more political,” says Jon Jarvis, the former National Park Service director under the Obama administration. “The administration did not want to suffer the public outcry that came during the last shutdown.”After a 16-day government shutdown in 2013, the government faced massive public backlash as disappointed park visitors flooded social media with images showing closed gates at parks across the U.S.But now, “exposure to sewage is a huge risk to human health,” says Regas.On Wednesday, campsites at Joshua Tree National Park in California were forced to shut down as pit toilets reached capacity. The NPCA also says human waste has been seen on roads and in open areas.Regas says the lack of staffing has led to little information on the scale of the problem.Leaving trash out in the open could also upset the delicate balance parks must maintain between visitors and wildlife.“For the past couple of decades, the park service has worked hard to wean the black bear population from human food,” says Jarvis. Once animals like bears or coyotes begin to associate humans with food, Jarvis says the risk that an animal could attack or have to be euthanized increases.Walking off trails or camping in prohibited areas could also have lasting impacts.“In the desert, so many species live under ground, so walking off trail could be really hurtful,” says David Lamfrom, the director of the California desert and wildlife programs at the National Parks Conservation Association.“There are well-intentioned people who are leaving long term effects in national parks because they don’t have the ability to consult with rangers,” he says. “The longer this goes on, the larger the impact becomes.”Understaffed parks can also be dangerous for visitors. Three deathshave been reported in parks since the shutdown, and one injured manwas carried to safety by strangers passing through.Already, the National Park Service backlog includes $11.6 billion worth of deferred infrastructure projects, such as maintaining roads and waterways. Without entrance fees, parks are losing out on roughly $400,000 a day.Once the government reopens, Jarvis says park employees will be responsible for cleaning up the mess left by visitors, further delaying projects that have already been deferred. No news about any additional funding to assist in the clean-up has been announced.It's unclear how much trash has accumulated thus far. A calculation by the news outlet Quartz and maintaining clean parks requires functioning infrastructure and visitor education.“The national parks in America are considered the best in the world—not just because they're pretty,” says Jarvis. “They're managed to a very high standard.”Both Regas and Jarvis say the parks should be fully shut down until the government reopens to prevent any further damage.Lamfrom says the full scale of the problem is yet to be determined but clean up timelines will range in length.“Some [efforts] will take weeks or months. Some will last generations. Some may not be able to be fixed.”",
"The government of the Seychelles has created two new marine protected areas in the country's remote Indian Ocean archipelago. The sanctioned areas will cover more than 81,000 square miles—a swath of space about the size of Great Britain.The protected areas will be rolled out in two phases. The first phase will cover 29,000 square miles around the remote Aldabra Group in the country's outer islands, and the second phase will protect 52,000 square miles of deep water. The total acreage will make up 16 percent of the country's ocean territory, and it is part of an ambitious project to protect nearly 160,000 square miles of the country by 2022."The Seychelles waters really are some of the finest on Earth and it's a complete delight that the government has protected them," says Paul Rose, a National Geographic explorer who led an expedition in Seychelles in 2015.Results from the Pristine Seas study helped provide the country's government with the scientific proof it needed to establish the marine areas as protected. The Nature Conservancy teamed up with the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and other private funders to refinance the country's debt and help the Seychelles make the marine protected areas possible.An elder of the Banjo tribe hunts for fish off the coast of Sampela, Indonesia.Located nearly 1,000 miles off the coast of East Africa, Seychelles is a thriving ecosystem made up of 115 islands. The biodiverse area houses scores of species, from endangered dugongs and turtles to 100,000 rare giant tortoises that are only found in this region. Tuna and sharks live in the waters off the islands, which also serve as nesting grounds for rare migratory birds.The newly protected areas will serve as a sanctuary for some of the planet's most endangered marine life while supporting sustainable fisheries and tourism. Since 99 percent of the country is ocean, its 100,000 human residents rely heavily on marine resources for their economy.With its white beaches and crystal-clear waters, Seychelles may seem like a pristine island nation. But the environment's diverse ecosystem is threatened. Foreign fishing boats often encroach on Seychelles waters to illegally poach loads of sharks and tuna and take them away to outside markets."Until this marine protected area had been agreed, foreign fishing boats could just go through these waters and overfish," Rose says.The island nation is also threatened by the warming temperatures and rising sea levels brought on by climate change. Healthy reef ecosystems can help to mitigate climate change and have positive effects on the environment, so establishing marine protected areas will help Seychelles in the long run.To investigate the hidden threats to the island ecosystem, Rose and the Pristine Seas expedition team completed 260 dives in Seychelles. With information gathered from their fieldwork, they then submitted a scientific report and short film to back up the claim that the marine area needed to be protected."It's got to be science-based," Rose says. "And so we agreed to fill those gaps, fill in those missing pieces of the jigsaw, as it were. This helped the Seychelles government to make the decision that they made today. "In the future, the hope is that Seychelles can continue to be the pristine tourist destination many people see it as today."This reinforces the view that people have of Seychelles," Rose says. "It will probably surprise a lot of people that this [protection] would even be needed."",
"Nick Page, a genial New Zealander with a sunburned face and curly black hair, holds a photograph of Assumption Island’s Most Wanted: a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird about the size of a cardinal with a black Mohawk crest and a fiery red tuft of feathers behind each eye. Since 2013, a team of conservation rangers have shot and netted 5,278 red-whiskered bulbuls on this four-square-mile comma of land 250 miles north of Madagascar. There is now one bulbul left.Page has come within range of 5,279 twice, but bad luck prevented a shot. On the first occasion, a kite flew overhead, spooking his quarry, and on the second, a rainstorm struck. Such are the trials of the everyday sniper. But Page, a young conservation graduate, says that “with a bit of luck and lots of hiding,” he’ll nail the bulbul. He extends his thumb and grins, saying, “That’s the size of the target.”Red-whiskered bulbuls are jaunty birds with a chattering song. Natives of Asia, they were brought to Assumption as pets by guano miners from Mauritius in the 1970s. Whether they escaped from their cages or were liberated is unknown, but the population exploded, and the pets became pests. The reason they’re being eradicated isn’t their presence on Assumption; rather it’s their proximity to Aldabra, 17 miles across the Indian Ocean.Aldabra giant tortoises escape searing daytime heat by taking refuge in caves within the rugged coral rock of the island of Grande Terre. It’s a slow, cumbersome commute between the caves and the tortoises’ grazing areas.Aldabra is the westernmost of Seychelles’ 115 islands and atolls and one of the world’s most important nature reserves. Among its biological treasures is a native bulbul. Conservation managers fear that if the Asian immigrant colonizes the island, it will compete with the local bulbul and other native birds for limited food resources, prey on endemic invertebrates, and introduce the seeds of invasive plants.To protect the jewels, you have to repel the invaders, eradication project leader Jessica Moumou tells me. “Red-whiskered bulbuls got to Aldabra once; they can do it again.” The Seychelles Islands Foundation, which manages Aldabra, can’t risk that, so it’s tackling the problem at its source, on Assumption.Bulbuls aren’t the only birds the hunters have in their sights. The finchlike Madagascar fody, a bird so blazingly red it appears to be on fire, is also being extirpated. It too has a counterpart on Aldabra. In the early 2000s the foreign fody established a hundred-strong population on Aldabra before it was detected and extermination efforts began.Killing a bird to save a bird may seem a perverse exchange—a misguided intrusion into nature’s affairs. Ecological restoration of islands is sometimes criticized as being no better than the human interference that damaged island ecosystems in the first place. It plays God with nature—taking a piece out here, adding a piece back in there. (Other stories in National Geographic’s 2016 parks series, celebrating the centenary of the U.S. parks system, focus on the restoration theme too.)Restoration ecologists see things differently, invoking the principle “You break it, you fix it.” Humans introduced alien species, either intentionally or accidentally, and those species have altered island ecosystems, in some cases shattering them beyond recognition.This is especially true when the newcomers are mammals. On isolated archipelagoes such as the Seychelles—and my own country of New Zealand—life evolved in the almost complete absence of mammals. (In both groups of islands, the only native land mammals are bats.) Island species cannot withstand the mammalian predation and competition that evolved on continents. Restoration seeks to level the ecological playing field. And sometimes the only way to do that is to remove the bullies from the schoolyard.Ten days after I met Page, he shot the last red-whiskered bulbul.Lounging in inches of bath-warm water, blacktip reef sharks wait for the tide to refill the lagoon at remote Aldabra Atoll.We live, we are told, in the age of the sixth mass extinction, a human-induced spasm of species loss, a great redacting of the story of life. How do we reverse that trajectory? We could begin by reciting the opening words of the Seychelles Constitution: “We, the People of Seychelles, GRATEFUL to Almighty God that we inhabit one of the most beautiful countries in the world; EVER MINDFUL of the uniqueness and fragility of Seychelles … [declare our unswaying commitment] to help preserve a safe, healthy and functioning environment for ourselves and for posterity.”If this sounds like a conservation manifesto, so it should, for there is much in Seychelles to conserve, especially on the granitic islands in the east of the archipelago. These islands, where most of the 93,000 Seychellois live, are the mountaintops of a submerged landmass that split off the supercontinent of Gondwana along with India and Madagascar 125 million years ago, carrying with it an ancient biota.Eons of evolutionary isolation coupled with occasional injections of new biological capital have produced a cast of curiosities that includes frogs smaller than a fingernail and giant tortoises that weigh a quarter of a ton, a palm with a nut so large it would crush your skull if it fell on you and a tree whose seedpods look like jellyfish, a scorpion with praying mantis arms that whip out and snatch prey in a death grasp and land crabs the size of cats.The easternmost of the granitics is Frégate, a privately owned island with a luxury resort and several creatures for which this island is a last resort. One of those species is the Seychelles magpie-robin, whose chic black-and-white plumage and inquisitive disposition have made it a local favorite. It was once widespread, but by the mid-1960s there were fewer than 15 alive, all on this island of less than a square mile. Conservationists launched a recovery program. Feral cats were eradicated. The robins were provided with nest boxes and supplementary food to boost their breeding chances. As numbers grew, birds were shifted to other predator-free island sanctuaries to spread the risk, and today the population has been coaxed up to several hundred.No less important in Frégate’s pantheon of relics are giant millipedes: glossy black, finger-thick, six-inch-long arthropods that cluster in knots on the trunks of trees and cross the island’s roads with impunity. “I Brake for Millipedes” would make a good bumper sticker for the golf carts that resort guests use. The magnificent crawlers are most active after dark, so I joined Tanya Leibrick, the resort’s conservation manager, for a night stroll through the forest. It was a slow walk, each step placed with care to avoid a fateful crunch. Scientists have calculated that one-fifth of the leaf litter that falls in the forest every 24 hours is consumed by hungry millipedes. In one spot we saw a dozen feasting on a fallen mango, like piglets at a trough.Scanning a nearby log, our headlamp beams settled on a solitary gray-brown beetle with bumps on its abdomen like Braille and two tiny grappling hooks at the tip of each leg. I had been hoping to meet this insect, one of the world’s largest tenebrionids, or darkling beetles, found in the wild only on Frégate.It’s a wonder that this placid giant (over an inch long) survives. In 1995 an island conservationist’s worst nightmare came to pass: Rats arrived on Frégate. The Seychelles name for the big beetle is bib armé, armored spider, but no amount of skeletal armor would have protected it—or the whip scorpions, snails, and other native invertebrates—from rodent teeth. In four years the beetle population plummeted by 80 percent.An urgent call went out for international help to prevent an ecological collapse, and in 2000 Frégate was successfully de-ratted. Some of my countrymen were part of the effort, and the memory of that narrow escape, mingled with the sultry darkness of the forest, the whistling and cackling of noddies and terns in the treetops, the rustling of millipedes in the leaf litter, and this lone beetle, illuminated, seemed like an amazing grace.A thin, pale blue snake showed itself at our feet, and Leibrick pulled away some leaves to reveal not a snake but a limbless amphibian called a caecilian, another Seychelles specialty. The pointy-headed animal whipped its body in violent twists and retreated into the safety of its burrow. Caecilians are thought to be part of the Seychelles’ original cargo—creatures that made the long-ago raft trip from Gondwana. Such species are known as deep endemics, because their genetic lineage reaches back into ancient time. They make Seychelles very special indeed.Aldabra has one of the last healthy populations of coconut crabs in the western Indian Ocean. Elsewhere, the world’s largest terrestrial arthropod, with a leg span of three feet, has been eaten to extinction by humans.“Not even a handful of island groups have what Seychelles has,” says conservation ecologist Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury. “Galápagos is a big name because of Darwin, but Seychelles is in no way inferior.” I was climbing with Kaiser-Bunbury to look for jellyfish trees on Seychelles’ main island, Mahé. As with many ecologically damaged islands, to find relict species you go high—to the mountaintops, beyond the reach of agriculture and habitation. We were scaling one of the granite outcrops known to scientists as inselbergs and to Seychellois as glacis, domes of reddish-gray rock, sculpted by the rainfall of millennia, that jut nakedly above the verdant forest.Plants get a foothold in clefts and fissures in the granite, and much of what lives here is endemic, including the jellyfish tree, Medusagyne. Fewer than two dozen reproducing individuals of this singular species have been recorded—and only here, on the granite, where most other plants find the baking heat and scouring rain intolerable. For reasons no one is sure about, the seed rarely germinates in the wild—a big liability for a critically endangered plant. The specimen we found looked healthy but had just a few of the trademark pods that hang like tiny jellyfish amid shining green leaves. It will be a long road to recovery for the beleaguered species, here on the glacis—islands within an island, refuges for remnants from long ago.Giant millipedes (above) and flightless beetles were threatened when rats reached the island resort of Frégate in the mid-1990s. An international response restored the island to a rodent-free sanctuary.Lower down the mountain, where glacis meets rain forest, we encountered a work crew slashing invasive vegetation and wrenching out young coco plum, guava, and cinnamon plants—which germinate only too easily—to help endemics such as carnivorous pitcher plants regain a foothold. Kaiser-Bunbury explained that the goal of restoration is rebuilding ecosystem integrity and functionality, not reverse-engineering a landscape that existed a hundred, or a thousand, or ten thousand years ago. It’s not about slavishly re-creating the picture on an old jigsaw puzzle box, but letting the living pieces of a fragmented system reconnect themselves and recover their historic trajectory. “We help the system get back on track,” he said. “We’re not just gardening.”It’s an idea whose time has come, just as biologist E. O. Wilson, the “father of biodiversity,” predicted almost 25 years ago, saying this century would be “the era of restoration in ecology.” It is capturing the imagination of Seychellois too. As realization of the country’s biological richness sinks in, enthusiasm to protect it rises. Wildlife clubs are thriving in schools. “The young generation is getting into it,” Terence Vel, the clubs’ coordinator, told me. “Twenty years we’ve been working with the schools to pass those messages to them. We take them snorkeling and on field trips to show that we have a fragile ecosystem and must look after it for the next generation.”Some older Seychellois have been walking the restoration road for a while. On the granite slabs of Mahé, park ranger Terence Valentin, a Rastafarian who wears a T-shirt on his head to contain a mass of dreadlocks, told me: “I’m 19 years with the environment, brother. Ya, man, I am connected to the Earth!”On Aldabra, the staff live that connection daily, on sea, on land, even inside their homes. Sunbirds build their nests on light fittings and shower rails, and steal the occasional necklace to decorate the nests. One giant tortoise that lives near the scientific station has figured out how to clamber up the steps for a drink of water.Aldabra has more tortoises than Seychelles has people. Everything about these behemoths seems ancient, even the sound of their movements, which is like the creak of a leather saddle. Endemic birds called drongos hitch rides on their backs, watching for insects disturbed by the giants’ lumbering passage. At night I listened to the sea breathing in the rocks and the tortoises snoring under the floorboards. “This place changes your life,” Jude Brice, a boat skipper, said. “You see things differently.”On a hillside in Victoria, Mahé’s historic center, stands an unusual church clock that chimes twice—once on the hour, then again a few minutes later. I think of it as a metaphor for Seychelles: a second chime for a second chance, ringing out the rescue of robins, beetles, pitcher plants, and palms, a celebration of nature restored.High tide in Aldabra lagoon finds green turtles grazing on sea grass. Here and on other Seychelles islands, exploitation by humans has given way to admiration and a desire to protect and restore.",
