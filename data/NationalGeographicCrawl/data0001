["Researchers sample the contents of Ötzi the Iceman's stomach to figure out the exact species of plants and animals that made up his final meal.Ötzi the Iceman's stomach wasn't where it was supposed to be. The misplaced organ eluded researchers for some 20 years. But in 2009, while looking at new radiographic scans, they finally found it—inexplicably pushed up under his ribs, where the lower lungs usually sit. What's more, it was completely full.Since 1991, when a pair of hikers found the 5,300-year-old hunter in the Ötztal Alps, researchers have been scouring Ötzi's frozen, shriveled form for clues to life in the past and his violent demise. They've studied his sheepskin coat and goat skin tights; scrutinized his tooth decay; ogled his likely frostbite-induced nub on his toe; ruminated over parasitic worm eggs in his gut; and cataloged every tattoo inked on his skin.And now, after putting the stomach contents through a battery of tests, the researchers determined the ice mummy's final meal: dried ibex meat and fat, red deer, einkorn wheat, and traces of toxic fern. The results, published this week in the journal Current Biology, offer a stunningly detailed peek into an ancient diet and hint at possible food preparation methods.In the late 90s, with Ötzi's stomach nowhere to be found, researchers studied the nitrogen isotopes of the mummy's hair for dietary clues, which suggested the Iceman was a vegetarian. Later analysis of his colon contents pointed to Ötzi's omnivorous ways, revealing he ate not only cereals but also red deer and goat meat in the day before his death.But in this latest work, scientists were trying to figure out the exact species that made up the Iceman's last meal. And to do that, they had to sample his stomach.They located the wandering organ by examining Ötzi's gall stones, which form in the gallbladder, a small sack sitting below the liver near the stomach. By lining up the position of surrounding organs in radiographic images, the team finally found the stomach.To sample it, however, scientists had to first defrost the mummy, which is kept at a chilly 21.2 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent microbial invasion. They then used an endoscopic tool to pull 11 blobs of brownish yellow material from his stomach and intestines.Unlike the mushy intestinal material, the crumbly stomach stuffs were essentially freeze dried, study author Frank Maixner explains. “It has an interesting appearance, actually,” he says.The research team first took a peek under magnification. “Already under a microscope it was clear it was an omnivore diet,” says Maixner, who is a microbiologist at the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy. Tiny flecks of undigested fibers of plants and meat were visible in the sample, surrounded by a cloudy haze of fat. The team then began their array of tests, which included DNA, proteins, lipids, metabolites, and more.A tiny piece of undigested plant tissue researchers spotted in the Iceman's stomach contents.Lipids and protein analysis indicate that Ötzi was eating both muscle and fat of the ibex (Capra ibex), a goat still common in the Ötztal Alps. The high-fat stomach contents would have supported energy-intensive treks. “Even though maybe ibex fat tastes horrible,” Maixner jokes.But curiously, though DNA analysis suggests red deer (Cervus elaphus) was also part of the meal, researchers couldn't figure out what part of the creature Ötzi ate. One possibility is that he consumed its organs, like the spleen, liver, or brain. Degradation may also be an issue. “It's really hard to say,” Maixner says.They could, however, look at meat preparation. By studying the meat's microstructures and chemistry and comparing it to modern cooked and uncooked meats, they surmised Ötzi's meat was not heated above 140 degrees Fahrenheit. It's most likely the meat was dried for preservation, Maixner says, since fresh meat spoils quickly. The presence of carbon flecks also hint the meat could have been smoked.Ötzi also ate einkorn wheat and the toxic bracken fern. When eaten in sufficient doses, bracken has been associated with anemia in cattle, and blindness in sheep. It may also have carcinogenic effects. Yet some people still eat small quantities of the plant.It's possible Ötzi also indulged in this greenery. “ You can go as far as he might have treated stomach ache with this fern since we knew that he suffered from some stomach pathogens,” says Maixner. But he adds, “this, for me at least, goes a little bit too far.” Another possibility is that he wrapped his food in fern, accidentally ingesting pieces along with his snack—an idea previously proposed for Ötzi's ingested moss.Together, the diet shows a well-prepared meal, with some fiber, protein and lots of energy-rich fat. “They had knowledge on making preparing the proper clothes, the proper hunting equipment, and this is also true for the diet,” Maixner says. “They were clearly well prepared.”Though it's just a single sample, the results give a surprisingly detailed look into Ötzi's final hours. “I don't know if we're going to get a whole lot better than this,” says Katherine Ryan Amato, a biological anthropologist at Northwestern University who wasn't involved in the work.Researchers have long used indirect methods to look at diet, broadly looking at transitions through time, she explains. “This actually lets us get at it on a finer scale and talk about it in more detail,” she says, “which is really exciting.”The events surrounding Ötzi's death are still debated. His many recent wounds point to violent conflict, and some say Ötzi fled into the mountains while being hunted down. But Maixner says that the last meal points to a slightly different story: “I personally think he was prepared for this trek.”The mix of cereals and meats—and just two completed arrows in his deer hide quiver—suggests he hadn't just eaten a fresh kill. Instead, in the hours before his death, Ötzi likely consumed the contents of what Maixner calls “a well-prepared doggy bag.”",
"More than 14 years have passed since Dan Buettner first wrote about the world’s longest-lived people for the magazine. Today he’s still uncovering the secrets of centenarians in regions he calls the blue zones. He recently returned to four of them to learn more about the foods that contribute to this remarkable longevity, collecting time-tested recipes and investigating why certain foods seem to promote long lives.Franca Piras (at right), with help from neighbors Angela Loi and Marisa Stochino, and Piras’s daughter, Michela Demuro, and granddaughter Nina, prepare culurgiones, a traditional dish of the Ogliastra area. The pasta dough is shaped into pockets and stuffed with potato, pecorino cheese, and mint.Ninety-nine-year-old Assunta Podda vigorously stirs an earthen pot and flashes a toothy smile. “Minestrone,” she explains with a swooping hand gesture.I peer into the mélange of beans, carrots, onions, garlic, tomatoes, fennel, kohlrabi, herbs—all under a golden veneer of olive oil. Behind her, a shaft of evening light angles through a window and illuminates a table with a medieval spread: sourdough loaves, foraged greens, a carafe of garnet red wine.“Sit,” she insists, deploying the region’s generous albeit predatory hospitality. I join her family and Gianni Pes, an epidemiologist who studies the region.Podda’s traditional embroidered blouse, filigreed necklace, and black sweater contrast sharply with her nimble movements: With the steady hand of a younger woman, she pours wine into stout glasses and ladles steaming soup into dishes.“Now eat.”We’re on the eastern slopes of Sardinia’s Gennargentu mountains in Arzana, a village in a region with the world’s highest concentration of male centenarians. In the years after World War II, 38 people in this village—one out of every 100 of their peers—have reached a century.Pes discovered this phenomenon in the late 1990s. Since then, he’s meticulously interviewed more than 300 centenarians, using extensive questionnaires. He believes that steep streets, zeal for family, reverence for elders, a matriarchal culture in which women bear most of the family stress, and a simple traditional diet explain much of this longevity. Pes says he’s found that the spouses of centenarians live longer than the siblings of centenarians, suggesting to him that diet and lifestyle may make a bigger difference than genes.Pes, who favors blue-framed glasses and a silver goatee, slurps a spoonful of soup. “Delizioso!” he proclaims, glancing admiringly at Podda, who closes her eyes and shrugs.Minestrone serves up essential amino acids, a potpourri of vitamins, and a range of fibers. Pes has found that centenarians have specific strains of bacteria in their digestive systems that convert fiber into unusually high levels of odd-chain fatty acids. These saturated fats are associated with a lower risk of heart disease and may prevent cancer.Cruciferous vegetables, like the cabbage and especially kohlrabi that find their way into almost every bowl of Sardinian minestrone, also may play a role. After observing the high percentage of centenarians with goiters—a condition that accompanies a low-functioning thyroid—Pes speculates that thiocyanate from a steady diet of kohlrabi may blunt thyroid function. That may help Sardinians live longer by reducing their rate of metabolism, Pes says, just as a lighter with a low flame lasts longer.In Seùlo, another centenarian-blessed village, Pes and I visited a century-old community bakery. A dozen women were making the distinctive bread eaten with most meals. We watched them build a blazing fire in a brick bread oven and knead dough with strong arms, their faces flushed. The senior baker, a short, vigorous octogenarian named Regina Boi, hovered over the process in her black dress and head scarf, dispensing advice and signaling when the dough was ready and the oven hot enough.Boi had provided the starter dough, a gooey froth resembling curdled milk that her family has cultivated for generations. The starter contains yeast and native Lactobacillus bacteria. The yeast and lactobacilli produce carbon dioxide that leavens the bread, and the lactobacilli also break down the carbohydrates to produce lactic acid. The acid imparts a sour taste, but more important, Pes tells me, the bread’s carbohydrates enter the bloodstream 25 percent slower than those of plain white bread.As dinner with Podda’s family winds down with a spirited exchange of village gossip, Pes, in a flush of revelry, raises his glass and belts out the signature toast of the island, delivered in the local dialect: “A kent’ annos!” “May you live to 100!”“And may you be here to count the years!” the family bellows. A beat later, Podda softly repeats it. Indeed, since our dinner together, she’s celebrated her 100th birthday.When Pes began his study of centenarians, he denoted areas with long-lived residents with blue marks on a map. He noticed such a profusion in Sardinia’s Nuoro Province that he began to refer to the area as the “blue zone.” I met Pes while canvassing the world in search of longevity hot spots, and I adopted his term for similar areas I uncovered: Nicoya, Costa Rica; the Greek island of Ikaria; Japan’s Okinawa island; and a community of Seventh-day Adventists in Southern California.I’ve examined dietary surveys of each region and inventoried their foods of the past century. Until the late 20th century, these diets consisted almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods—mostly whole grains, greens, nuts, tubers, and beans. People ate meat on average only five times a month. They drank mostly water, herbal teas, coffee, and some wine. Notably, they drank little or no cow’s milk; soda pop was largely unknown to them. As globalization spreads, processed foods, animal products, and fast foods are supplanting the traditional diets. Not surprisingly, chronic diseases are on the rise in the blue zones.A healthy diet is just one part of a web of longevity-promoting factors that also include having a circle of lifelong friends, a sense of purpose, an environment that nudges one into constant movement, and daily rituals that mitigate stress.(Take a look at how diets stack up around the world.)Paulina Villegas serves a hearty breakfast that’s typical in the Nicoya region to her 102-year-old father, Pachito, and her nephew Sixto. The meal includes coffee, eggs, rice and beans, and tortillas cooked on a traditional wood-fired stove known as a fogón.I found all of those factors in Costa Rica’s Nicoya region, as well as what might be the world’s healthiest breakfast, in an open-air building with a vaulted red-tiled roof blackened with smoke.Every morning at daybreak in the city of Santa Cruz, María Elena Jiménez Rojas and a dozen or so other women at Coopetortilla stoke wood fires in long, clay ovens and stir cauldrons of spicy beans. Rojas, wearing a smudged apron over an immaculate white T-shirt, pinches off a golf ball–size piece of corn dough, plops it down on waxed paper, and rotates it with mechanical precision into a round patty. She slaps it onto a hot clay plate called a comal, where it roasts briefly before expanding into a puffy pancake and collapsing into a perfect tortilla.Three women mix black beans with onions, red peppers, and herbs. The beans will cook to tender perfection and then be mixed with rice and sautéed bell peppers, onions, and garlic to produce a uniquely Costa Rican version of gallo pinto.Nearly 30 years ago, Rojas tells me, the cooperative was just a tortilla shop. But young single mothers came to her for work, and she’s helped dozens lift themselves out of poverty.A few minutes before 6 a.m., the first customers file in. They sit on benches at long, green tables, where waitresses, wearing simple dresses and flip-flops, serve giant cups of weak coffee, plates of gallo pinto, and baskets of warm tortillas. As lilting ranchera music drifts in from a distant radio, customers fill their tortillas with beans, top them with hot sauce called chilero, and wash them down with black coffee, savoring a recipe for longevity reflecting thousands of years of culinary genius.Costa Rica’s blue zone is a roughly 30-mile-long strip that runs along the spine of the Nicoya Peninsula; it doesn’t include the tourist resorts on the coast. The region consists mostly of dry pastureland and forests. Until about 50 years ago, people here were mostly subsistence farmers or ranch hands, supplementing a corn-and-bean diet with tropical fruits, garden vegetables, and, occasionally, wild game and fish.The region’s Chorotega people, who most influenced the diet, have been eating essentially the same food for millennia. That may help explain why adults here have the longest life expectancy in the Americas and men older than 60 have the lowest reliably measured rate of mortality for their age group in the world.Corn tortillas might contribute to that longevity. They are an excellent source of grain, with complex carbohydrates rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. The wood ash the women add when they soak the corn breaks down the cell walls of the kernels and releases niacin—which helps control cholesterol.Black beans contain the same pigment-based antioxidants found in blueberries. They’re also rich in colon-cleansing fiber.With his extended family around him, 102-year-old Saúl Guzmán Salas, who lives in Hojancha on Costa Rica’s Nicoya Peninsula, pedals an exercise bicycle.A woman working at Coopetortilla in Costa Rica cooks a handmade corn tortilla on a wood-fired clay oven using a traditional technique. The tortillas will be served for breakfast with a uniquely Costa Rican version of gallo pinto, or rice and beans.The magic comes in pairing corn with beans. Our bodies need nine amino acids—the building blocks of protein—to make muscle. Animal products such as meat, fish, and eggs provide all nine, but they also contain cholesterol and saturated fat. Together beans and corn provide all of these amino acids—with none of those unhealthy elements.Researchers are looking into whether the combination may preserve cellular health too. Stanford social epidemiologist David Rehkopf and Costa Rican demographer Luis Rosero-Bixby have found that Nicoyans have longer telomeres on average than Costa Ricans overall. Telomeres are protective “caps” on the ends of DNA strands, which wear down over time, a rough marker of biological age. Rehkopf, who joined me in Costa Rica, told me that Nicoyans seem to be up to a decade younger biologically than their chronological age. Another group with longer than average telomeres? The poor—who may be more likely to subsist largely on beans, tortillas, chilero, and black coffee.At Coopetortilla, I dig into my breakfast, chasing chilero-topped beans wrapped in fresh tortillas with gulps of coffee. Sweat beads on my forehead, and tears roll down my face. “Are you okay?” Rojas asks, flashing me a look of sincere concern. “Don’t worry,” I say. “These are tears of joy.”Half a world away on Okinawa, I prepare to sample yet another contender for the world’s healthiest breakfast at the Daiichi Hotel in Naha with Craig Willcox, another researcher seeking dietary clues to longevity.On Okinawa, as compared with the United States, residents are three times as likely to reach 100, women suffer about half the rate of breast cancer, both sexes are afflicted by a third to a quarter the rate of heart disease, and elderly people die from Alzheimer’s dementia at a tenth to a twelfth the rate.Each morning the hotel founder, Yoshiko Shimabukuro, 91, a short energetic woman, and her daughter Katsue Watanabe, a certified vegetable sommelier, prepare plant-based dishes from some 50 ingredients, about half of which are unique to Okinawa. Before us, in appetizer-size plates and bowls, lies a starburst of colorful foods, many of which helped create what remains, by several measures, the world’s longest-lived population despite a decline in the health of younger generations.Willcox, an anthropologist and gerontologist, points out that everything in this 20-course meal—including tofu soup, carrot salad, a boiled fern called otani-watari, and papaya stir-fry—is light on calories. Okinawan food, he tells me, is nutritionally dense and calorically poor, while in the U.S. it’s the reverse.With his twin, Bradley, and their mentor, Makoto Suzuki, Willcox has written books that lay out most of what we know about the island’s traditional diet. The brothers showed up in Okinawa in 1994 interested in studying centenarians and hooked up with Suzuki. For a quarter century the trio has chronicled what people here eat and investigated why it helps them elude disease. Now I’m getting a hands-on lesson.Willcox points a chopstick at a tofu stir-fry with sea green crescents of goya, or bitter melon, a key ingredient in goya champuru, a classic Okinawan dish. Goya is high in vitamins A and C, folate, and powerful antioxidant compounds that can help protect your cells against damage, he says. It’s anticancer, protective of liver and cell membranes, a free radical scavenger, inhibiting of bacteria such as E. coli, and capable of lowering blood sugar. I bite down on a piece, unleashing a flavor explosion redolent of chewing a mouthful of aspirin—only more piquant. As with beer, which people often don’t like at first, the bitter taste grows on you.With a tuft of sandy brown hair and round spectacles that make him look like a middle-aged Harry Potter, Willcox moves on to the tofu, which is denser and more cheeselike than other Japanese tofu. As the protein centerpiece of the daily Okinawan diet, it often replaces less healthy proteins, such as meat or eggs. Traditionally made with seawater, Okinawan tofu is rich in calcium, magnesium, zinc, and other minerals that most Americans lack in their diet. It’s also high in genistein and in daidzein, which metabolizes into equol. Genistein and equol are isoflavonoids that Willcox notes are associated with reducing the risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease.Yoshiki Toyokawa, co-owner of Chouraku restaurant in Kin Town, Okinawa, retrieves a bucket of fermented tofu from a cool limestone cave that also holds about 13,000 bottles of awamori, a liquor distilled from rice. Soaked in an awamori mixture and aged between three months and a year, this local style of tofu has a savory taste similar to cheese.Willcox hoists a porcelain cup containing a bright yellow brew. “Turmeric tea,” he says. He takes a sputtering sip and explains that dozens of studies have shown the active ingredient in turmeric can help our bodies protect against diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and dementia. Islanders have co-opted the Japanese trick of using pungent flavors, such as turmeric, to enhance the taste of healthy vegetables. Most recipes rely on dashi, a rich broth commonly made from bonito flakes or sea kelp. Dashi can convert a pile of vegetables into an explosion of deliciousness, resulting in a dish with fewer calories than a hamburger but with five times the nutrients—and it tastes good enough to eat every day.As I fill up my plate with more delicacies, Willcox fixes on a glutinous mass of seaweed resembling green spaghetti. Islanders consume more than a dozen varieties of seaweed, which he calls “sea vegetables.” This particular one, mozuku, boasts an abundance of fucoidan, an anticancer, antiviral compound that Willcox says may help reverse inflammation, manage blood sugar, and also grow blood vessels.Even more intriguing, another compound in seaweeds, called astaxanthin, has been linked to a gene that, when activated, seems to tell cells to clean up waste and reduce inflammation, which are at the root of the majority of age-related diseases.After two hours of learning and eating, I regard the sea of empty dishes. “I feel like a total glutton,” I say. “Don’t feel guilty,” Willcox replies. Our whole meal, he explains, contained fewer than 600 calories—about the same as eating a big cookieThe final stop on my journey is Loma Linda, California, where a community of Seventh-day Adventists has long followed a diet inspired by the Bible. Their guidelines originate from passages such as Genesis 1:29: “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.”Adventists who follow the diet tend to live longer. One study showed that life expectancy for Adventists in California was 7.3 years greater for men and 4.4 years greater for women than for similar Californians. Being both vegetarian and Adventist boosted life expectancy by an additional two years.When I asked researchers studying the diet to find someone who follows it, they sent me to 90-year-old Dorothy Nelson, who answers her door wearing a bright red T-shirt and running shoes, with schoolgirl bangs cut just above her hazel eyes. She welcomes me and leads me to her well-lit kitchen.Moving with the energy of a Chihuahua, Nelson begins cooking a savory lunch. When I compliment her cooking, she reveals her secret: “This kitchen is seasoned with love.”Over lunch she tells me about her life. When she was younger, she’d had an adventurous career as a pilot-nurse for church missions. Once, while she and her copilot were hopscotching across the Arctic, the plane’s engine sputtered, and they plummeted toward the earth, spotting a flat area on an ice floe between Canada and Greenland at the last minute. She figured they’d be all right, “as long as the good Lord wants me around,” she recalls. When the plane touched down, it skidded but stayed upright. “I got out and knelt down and thanked the Lord.”The half-frozen pair were picked up five days later. The rescuers gave them hot coffee. “I’d never tasted coffee,” she says. Caffeine and alcohol are discouraged for Adventists. Today Nelson limits her adventures to tending her vegetable garden.As a proponent of vegetarian ways, Nelson is a direct culinary descendant of Ellen G. White, who helped found what became the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a Protestant denomination. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, White first articulated the dietary prescriptions that have since guided this subculture of long-lived Americans.White praised the consumption of whole grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, which “impart a strength, a power of endurance, and a vigor of intellect, that are not afforded by a more complex and stimulating diet.” She warned against cooking with grease, spices, and salt, among other things, and discouraged the use of sugar, which “causes fermentation and this clouds the brain and brings peevishness into the disposition.” Her recommendations seem remarkably prescient, mirroring today’s dietary guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association.Most of the newest insights on the Adventist diet come from Gary Fraser, an Adventist and researcher at Loma Linda University, and a vegetarian who sometimes eats fish. With his combed-over sandy brown hair, Fraser looks a bit like a scoutmaster. Trained as a doctor, he noticed that Adventists had healthier hearts than non-Adventists, and he began to wonder whether science could validate his diet’s health claims. He now leads the Adventist Health Studies, which have monitored the health of tens of thousands of American Adventists.Their research indicates that, at a given age, vegetarian Adventists are about 12 percent less likely to die than nonvegetarian ones who eat only a small amount of meat. By contrast, among younger Adventists, those who eat the most meat suffer a 46 percent higher rate of premature death than those who get their protein from nuts, seeds, and legumes. “It’s clear that a plant-based diet is the way to go,” Fraser says.When I smell Nelson’s cooking, I’m inclined to agree. The aromas wafting from her stove make me hungry. After combining black beans with steamed cabbage and cauliflower, she adds slices of browned tofu, sesame seeds, and a dash of soy sauce. It’s a satisfying mix of complex carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, with fewer calories than a bag of french fries. “I’ve never tasted meat,” Nelson brags.She tells me she has perfect blood pressure and a resting heart rate of 60. She walks three miles a day.And there you have it: The vast majority of the calories eaten in the traditional diets in the blue zones come from plant-based whole foods. Grains, greens, nuts, and beans are the four pillars of every longevity diet on Earth.Nearly half the people who die this year in the U.S. will likely do so from cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes. In blue zones, far fewer suffer from these diseases. Why? For most of their lives, they’ve simply eaten what was readily available and, luckily for them, it was a whole food, plant-based diet. Trial and error yielded recipes that make these foods taste delicious enough to eat day after day. Therein, perhaps, lies the secret to a healthier you. If you want a good starter recipe, I know a feisty centenarian who makes a mean minestrone.",
"A 98-year-old man and his wife on Greece's Ikaria Island.Cento di questi giorni. May you have a hundred birthdays, the Italians say, and some of them do.So do other people in various spots around the world—in Blue Zones, so named by National Geographic Fellow Dan Buettner for the blue ink that outlines these special areas on maps developed over more than a decade. (National Geographic News is part of the National Geographic Society.)In his second edition of his book The Blue Zones, Buettner writes about a newly identified Blue Zone: the Greek island of Ikaria (map). National Geographic magazine Editor at Large Cathy Newman interviewed him about the art of living long and well. (Watch Buettner talk about how to live to a hundred.)Q. You've written about Blue Zones in Sardinia, Italy; Loma Linda, California; Nicoa, Costa Rica; and Okinawa, Japan. How did you find your way to Ikaria?A. Michel Poulain, a demographer on the project, and I are always on the lookout for new Blue Zones. This one popped up in 2008. We got a lead from a Greek foundation looking for biological markers in aging people. The census data showed clusters of villages there with a striking proportion of people 85 or older. (Also see blog: "Secrets of the Happiest Places on Earth.")In the course of your quest you've been introduced to remarkable individuals like 100-year-old Marge Jetton of Loma Linda, California, who starts the day with a mile-long [0.6-kilometer] walk, 6 to 8 miles [10 to 13 kilometers] on a stationary bike, and weight lifting. Who is the most memorable Blue Zoner you've met?Without question it's Stamatis Moraitis, who lives in Ikaria. I believe he's 102. He's famous for partying. He makes 400 liters [100 gallons] of wine from his vineyards each year, which he drinks with his friends. His house is the social hot spot of the island. (See "Longevity Genes Found; Predict Chances of Reaching 100.")He's also the Ikarian who emigrated to the United States, was diagnosed with lung cancer in his 60s, given less then a year to live, and who returned to Ikaria to die. Instead, he recovered.Yes, he never went through chemotherapy or treatment. He just moved back to Ikaria.Did anyone figure out how he survived?Nope. He told me he returned to the U.S. ten years after he left to see if the American doctors could explain it. I asked him what happened. "My doctors were all dead," he said.One of the common factors that seem to link all Blue Zone people you've spoken with is a life of hard work—and sometimes hardship. Your thoughts?I think we live in a culture that relentlessly pursues comfort. Ease is related to disease. We shouldn't always be fleeing hardship. Hardship also brings people together. We should welcome it.Sounds like another version of the fable of the grasshopper and the ant?You rarely get satisfaction sitting in an easy chair. If you work in a garden on the other hand, and it yields beautiful tomatoes, that's a good feeling.Can you talk about diet? Not all of us have access to goat milk, for example, which you say is typically part of an Ikarian breakfast.There is nothing exotic about their diet, which is a version of a Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes vegetables, beans, fruit, olive oil, and moderate amounts of alcohol. (Read more about Buettner's work in Ikaria in National Geographic Adventure.)All things in moderation?Not all things. Socializing is something we should not do in moderation. The happiest Americans socialize six hours a day.The people you hang out with help you hang on to life?Yes, you have to pay attention to your friends. Health habits are contagious. Hanging out with unhappy people who drink and smoke is hazardous to your health.So how has what you've learned influenced your own lifestyle?One of the big things I've learned is that there's an advantage to regular low-intensity activity. My previous life was setting records on my bike. [Buettner holds three world records in distance cycling.] Now I use my bike to commute. I only eat meat once a week, and I always keep nuts in my office: Those who eat nuts live two to three more years than those who don't.You also write about having a purpose in life.Purpose is huge. I know exactly what my values are and what I love to do. That's worth additional years right there. I say no to a lot of stuff that would be easy money but deviates from my meaning of life.The Japanese you met in Okinawa have a word for that?Yes. Ikigai: "The reason for which I wake in the morning."Do you have a non-longevity-enhancing guilty pleasure?Tequila is my weakness.And how long would you like to live?I'd like to live to be 200.",
"Kame Ogido, 89, a resident of Okinawa, holds a handful of edible seaweed. The Japanese island is defined by the author as a “Blue Zone,” where people live longest.In 2012, Dan Buettner set off around the world to answer a question that has obsessed philosophers and doctors since Methuselah: Why do people in some parts of the world live so much longer than others? His travels took him to Greece, Nicaragua and Japan, among others. Then he brought the lessons back to Main Street, USA.Speaking from his home in Minneapolis, the author of The Blue Zones Solution: The Revolutionary Plan To Eat And Live Your Way To Lifelong Health explains why the inhabitants of the Greek island of Ikaria are some of the healthiest people on the planet; why where you live and the company you keep, determine your longevity; and why we should all be having more sex.It’s a term for our project, first and foremost, but it’s been loosely used to describe parts of the world where people live the longest. More specifically, areas where we have a demographically confirmed, geographically defined, area where people are either reaching age 100 at extraordinary rates, have the highest life expectancy, or the lowest rate of middle age mortality.It’s in the central Aegean, just off the coast of Turkey, very close to Samos, where Pythagoras and Epicurus lived. This is an area that was largely isolated from the rest of ancient Greece and even modern Greece, and it incubated a set of lifestyles and a population that lives about eight years longer than average, with just a fraction of the [average] rate of dementia. So, these people live a long time. More to the point, they’re sharp to the very end. Whereas here in America about 50 percent of people over 85 are suffering from dementia.Diet does tend to be the entrance ramp for better health. In Ikaria, they are eating a variant of the Mediterranean diet. But they’re unique in that they eat a lot of potatoes. Their bean consumption is also high. Perhaps the most interesting ingredients are greens they call horta, which look like the kind of weeds the Department of Transportation would whack on the side of the road. They employ them as salad greens or greens that they’ll lightly steam and bake into pies. These greens are the food that’s most highly associated with healthy aging.That’s not a hard sell, is it? (Laughs) But it’s actually true. If you’re napping 30 minutes a day, five days a week, your chance of heart disease is about one third lower than if you muscle through the afternoon. We know that people who are having sex after the age of 50, at least twice per week, have about half the rate of mortality than people who aren’t gettin’ it. We know that moderate drinkers actually outlive non-drinkers. Wine has high levels of polyphenols and antioxidants. The alcohol in the wine also helps lower cortisol levels, a hormone associated with stress. If you drink a glass of wine with an Ikarian meal, it about triples the flavonoid absorption. It’s actually better to have a glass of wine with your meal than a glass of water. But not with your steak. That doesn’t work.None of the spry 90 and 100 year-olds I met exercise in the way we think of it, like spending half an hour on a treadmill. The secret they teach us is the importance of engineering “nudges” for physical activity into our daily life, like planting a garden, which sets up a nudge for the entire growing season to be out there watering, weeding or harvesting. And don’t look to completely convenience your life with mechanized tools. Houses in Ikaria have just hand tools. They knead bread by hand. They live in a place where every trip to the store or to work occasions a walk. I know it sounds hard to do in our lives. But you can make the decision to move your family from the suburbs to the city, for instance, where that kind of unconscious physical activity can re-enter your life.Ikaria Island off the coast of Greece is called “the island where people forget to die” because of the high proportion of 100-year-olds.The general trends are the same. They eat a plant-based diet; they live in walkable communities; their life is imbued with purpose. But the diet is obviously very different. They have the highest per capita consumption of tofu in the world, but eat very little fish. Sweet potatoes and turmeric are also two interesting longevity foods. About 60 percent of the dietary intake of Okinawans used to be sweet potatoes, which are high in flavonoids and complex carbohydrates. Turmeric has been associated with lower rates of cancer, and healthier hearts. It’s the yellow spice we use in curries. I’m not a big fan of supplements, but I’m a fan of turmeric.If you’re lonely in this country, it takes about eight years off your life expectancy as compared with the most connected people. In Okinawa, they traditionally don’t have to worry about loneliness because when you’re a child, you’re put by your parents into these moais. It can be defined as a committed social network that lasts a long time: a personal board of directors. I profiled several 102-year-old women who had belonged to the same moai for 98 years. They still gossip and drink sake and argue. But ultimately have each other’s backs when it comes to tough times.The Ikarian diet includes fruits, vegetables, beans, fish, and olive oil.Ikaria island, Greece.[Laughs] When Americans reach for protein, they tend to reach for animal products, which also contain fat and several toxic ingredients. People who are eating the highest levels of meat in this country have about 70 percent higher mortality than people who are eating little meat and a four-or five-times-worse chance of developing cancer. A cup a day of beans for protein is much cheaper and you’re not getting all the harmful ingredients with it. The big secret Blue Zones offer us is ways to make beans taste good. We don’t put any of our culinary effort into it. If you go any great restaurant, it’s going to be a steak or something wonderful done with pork. In Blue Zones, culinary effort is put into making things like an Ikarian stew, which is done with black eyed peas, fennel and garlic, and finished with wonderful virgin olive oil. It’s really hearty and the bowl is absolutely imbued with longevity.Bob Fagen was the city manager for Spencer, a very conservative town but one of our very first in Iowa to become Blue Zone Certified. His kidneys were failing, so he adopted these very simple Blue Zone ideas. At the same time, his city was undergoing a makeover to become more walkable and marginalize junk food. He adopted a plant- based diet, joined a moai, among other changes. He made his doctor promise that if he made all these Blue Zone changes, he could go off the five medicines he was taking for the kidney disease. His doctor said, “OK, but I’m checking you in six months and if your kidney disease persists, you’re going back on those medications.” Bob came back in six months and his kidney disease was gone. He then got all the city employees on board. Over the course of just one year, he saw the healthcare cost for city employees drop by 25 percent, which he attributes to the Blue Zone. So here you have this wonderful example of a city getting healthier but also—and this is where the rubber hits the road—saving money.First and foremost, our food environment. We can’t walk out of the house without being confronted with chips and sodas and fast food restaurants. We are evolutionarily hard wired to seek fat, sugar and salt. For most of human history this was a good thing. It enabled us to survive through hardship. But now we live in an environment of abundance and ease. The onus to stay healthy is mostly put on individual responsibility. It’s up to you to make the right choices instead of the bad choices. Well, forget that! [Laughs] You cannot make the right choices when your genes are screaming at you all day long to consume these things and we live in an environment that is shoving them in our faces. We have to shift the focus away from individual responsibility to changing our food environment: to minimizing junk food marketing and shifting the economic incentives to produce junk food, towards making healthier choices not only easier, but unavoidable. It sounds like a pipe dream. But it can be done.In Ikaria one of the main means of transportation is by foot. A 99 year old man takes his daily three mile walk to tend his goats.First of all, we have Blue Zone food guidelines, which offer a clear prescription for what we ought to be eating if we’re interested in living to 100. Number two: we ought to take a hard look at our social networks. If your friends are sitting on the couch eating Doritos, there’s about a 150 percent chance that you will be, too. Number three is to get really clear about your purpose in life. According to Gallop, fewer than a third of Americans are doing what they love at work. So, if you’re not living out your purpose at work, you’d better be doing it at home or in your extracurricular or volunteer activities. I’ll add a fourth one - and this is a disruptive. Think about where you’re living.Statistically speaking, where you live is the biggest, non-genetic influence on how healthy you are. If you’re living out in a suburb around a forest of junk food places, you’re not going to escape un-healthiness. You can live in a place like Binghamton, where about 37 per cent of the people are obese and they have very lax food policies. Or you can go to a place like San Luis Obispo, where there is 11 percent obesity and their leaders said a long time ago: we’re going to bring in policies that help our people eat better. Lo and behold, decades later, they’ve achieved it. We’re working with 23 cities that have enacted food policies. Every city has the capacity to do this.Exploration is more than about someone going to a place and making observations, which will sell magazines or books. Where exploration really earns its keep is when it improves the human experience, or adds to the body of knowledge to make our lives better. The first American city where we took observations from the Blue Zones and applied them was Albert Lee, Minnesota. In so doing, we raised life expectancy by three years and brought health care costs down by 40 percent. That was the big high five moment.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk.

"While most guidebook authors head to a destination for several months and pen some notes, writer Eliot Stein immersed himself in Sardinian culture by living there for nearly three years. His recently published guidebook to Sardinia is not only one of the most authoritative guides to the island, but it also promotes responsible travel from a true insiders’ perspective. The following are his recommendations of ways tourists can help preserve Sardinia’s unique culture.It’s no wonder that an island boasting nearly three sheep to every person is a destination for cheese connoisseurs. In fact, 80% of Italy’s pecorino hail from Sardinia (the name of the cheese, in fact, is derived from the word pecora, or sheep). Yet, the island’s shepherds–the enduring symbol of Sardinia’s bucolic traditions–are losing their land to developers eager to turn their pastures into profit. So what’s a tourist to do? For starters, help a shepherd by helping yourself to one of the island’s three DOP  pecorino varieties (I especially like fiore sardo). Adventurous travelers can check in to central Sardinia’s classiest hotel, Su Gologone, and sign up to spend the day working with a shepherd while learning about his way of life. See Su Gologone for more info.As stunning as Sardinia’s craggy creases and shimmering shorelines are, some of its most memorable sights are found underwater. Let local guides lead you through Roman shipwrecks, colorful coral and–my favorite–the largest underwater cave in the Mediterranean, Nereo. A great resource is ScubaTravel.A far cry from the siren call of the upscale Costa Smeralda, there is no lodging option truer to the spirit of Sardinia than spending a night in an agriturismo. These working farm inns are part petting zoo, part ethnographic museum, where your owner is always a local and willing to offer you the kind of rural hospitality that has made Sardinia famous throughout Italy.Most agriturismi are modest affairs. What they lack in, say, satellite TV, they more than make up for in free-range animals lying around. The meals served are almost always made entirely on the farm, so you never have to worry about its freshness. Be warned: come prepared to loosen your belt and put on a few pounds. Sardinia Farm Holidays is a good resource. Gen-Up on Local CultureWhip out the notebook and sign up for a crash course in local culture: Motus offers lots of guided nature walks; Stroll and Speak is a great way to learn Italian while burning calories strolling through Alghero’s cobblestone corsi; and Food Wine and Culture will allow you to return home with lots of local recipes to impress your friends.“Fairieshouses,” “giants tombs” and “human-like stones.” The prehistoric relics that dot Sardinia’s landscape may remind you of a bad acid trip, but touring the island’s many archaeological sites offers a fascinating glimpse into its mysterious origins. The most intriguing of all the historical remnants found are Sardinia’s more than 7,000 stone nuraghi towers7,000 stone nuraghi towers7,000 stone nuraghi towers. Built between 1600-1100 A.D., this is the only place on Earth to see these Bronze Age castles. Nuraghe Santu Antine is a must.Sardinia’s moody topography doesn’t exactly mean you’ll be downshifting into a leisurely pedal while biking. Yet, for the non-faint of heart, cycling through Sardinia is one of the most rewarding ways to experience the island’s natural beauty. I highly recommend Dolce Vita Bike Tours, run by four enthusiastic Sardinians. Haggle for HandicraftsSardinia is a hub for handicrafts, making it a souvenir shopper’s paradise. Look for wooden carnival masks, handmade lace, filigree jewelry, cork, and world famous handmade knives. Ensure your travelers’ checks aren’t being wired to foreign faux designers by looking for signs advertising “Prodotti Tipici Sardi,” or the island-sponsored I.S.O.L.A. co-op stores.Photos: Eliot Stein",
"Domestic and international tourists flock to this arc of palm-blanketed islands in the south to enjoy its sun-soaked beaches and the genuine friendliness of residents. Unfortunately, some places are "very crowded and hectic."Here is a representative sampling of additional anonymous comments from the panelists. They are not necessarily the views of the National Geographic Society"Local people were friendly. It does seem very crowded and hectic, though. Everything is laid out patchwork style—so much driving is required to get from one place to another.""The peace parks in the south are rather moving. Naha City is busy and has some interesting new buildings. The restoration of the Old Kingdom buildings is worthwhile. Far too much of the island is under the control of the U.S. military and their dreadful bases which cause environmental problems and too many social problems. Other parts are fine and the celebration of the traditional Ryukyu culture is worthwhile.""Removing the military base would be a good start, but the island overall has too large of a population base."« Back to Full List of Destinations Facing Trouble",
"As an emergency medicine physician since the mid-1990s, I’ve cared for all sorts of patients: old and young, rich and poor, male and female. I’ve also observed the companions who arrive with the patients, as they scramble to handle this health crisis amid work, family, and financial obligations. Often that burden lands chiefly on women, doing double, triple, quadruple duty to care for children, partners, parents, and other loved ones. It’s a global phenomenon: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says the world’s women spend more than 1.1 trillion hours a year on unpaid care of children and the elderly. Men spend about a third as much.As an executive producer on the television drama Grey’s Anatomy, I write these women into scripts. They are mothers, partners, wives, sisters, daughters, CEOs, and secretaries. The woman who just had a baby, thinks she has a blocked milk duct, and finds out too late that it’s breast cancer.1 The woman who doesn’t want to admit to being raped because she thinks she’ll be blamed for being where she was or wearing what she wore.Sometimes breast cancer cells avoid medical treatments by drifting away from tightly packed tumors and changing their internal machinery. They then resemble adult stem cells and can travel in the body and start new tumors elsewhere. By using existing drugs that target these tumor turned stem cells in mice, a team of biomedical researchers redirected their development so they became harmless fat cells. The treatment has shown the potential “to repress tumor invasion and malignant progression,” as scientists from the University of Basel, Switzerland, reported in the journal Cancer Cell. —Theresa MachemerThey’re women who have a terminal illness, or need an organ transplant—and have to break it to their daughters. Women confronting their sexuality head-on; getting pregnant at older ages and choosing alternate paths to motherhood, or being childless by choice. Women with brain tumors, mental illness, and depression; women with no insurance, and women who could buy the world.I write these women because I see these women. Because I am these women. I am firmly stuck in the “sandwich generation,” taking care of an aging mother and three young children. Working full-time. Juggling schools, schedules, extracurricular activities, babysitters, deadlines, caregivers, and professional goals, all while trying to have a semblance of a social life. I am a physician, I am a writer, I am a mother, I am a single woman. I am everywoman, we are multitudes—and we are frequently, quietly, overwhelmed.If this is the script of so many women’s lives, how do we find the means to nurture health and wellness?There’s plenty to fault in the medical care, treatment, research, and support that are available to the female half of humanity. But there also are reasons for optimism, in discoveries and advances that show real promise for girls and women. I’m especially hopeful when I see us do the single best thing we can do to promote well-being: Speak up!More women need to open their mouths and talk. About their miscarriages or their infertility or their contraception scares. About their cancer or their heart disease. About depression. Anxiety. Weight. Eating disorders. Alcohol abuse. Prescription drug abuse. Domestic violence. The stigma attached to such conditions keeps many of us silent. But without loud-and-clear advocacy, the research will not get funded and the policies will not get overhauled. It’s only by finding our voices that we can strengthen each other and grow together into a force for healthy change.In my role as a writer, obviously I’m a storyteller. I adapt real women’s stories to fashion characters’ stories; they’re the everywomen who appear in my TV show’s plots and in this essay. It’s my belief that good physicians also must be good storytellers. I practice what’s known as narrative medicine, which means essentially this: intently listening to a patient’s story, reading the story the patient’s body tells, and using both to craft a narrative for diagnosis and treatment.Take the story of Meredith, for example. She’s a surgeon, a widow with three young children, and manages to not only win accolades professionally but also spend time with her children and have a social life. She went to medical school in the early 2000s, when not even half the entering students were women. By 2018, 52 percent of those enrolling were women—progress! More broadly, by 2017, women earned 57 percent of bachelor’s degrees, 59 percent of master’s degrees, and 53 percent of doctorates in the United States, the National Center for Education Statistics reports. That’s truly progress, because the number one element of improving health care is educating women.Even with Meredith’s advanced degree—and though she introduces herself with the title doctor, wears the white coat, and sports a visible stethoscope—she’s regularly referred to as nurse while going about her hospital business. And if there’s a male medical student in the room when she makes rounds, patients will often tell their story to him instead of her. Stereotypes and bias are a real part of women’s lives, and gender bias is a real problem in medicine.Another example of that is Miranda—a successful surgeon, having made it through the glass ceiling to become chief of surgery at her hospital. She’s on her second marriage because her first husband couldn’t understand the demands of her job (a common refrain for professional women). She goes into a hospital complaining of the nonspecific symptoms that often signal a heart attack in women2—more subtle symptoms than men’s, such as upper abdominal pain, light-headedness, or unusual fatigue. Miranda is sure she is having a heart attack. (Spoiler alert: She is.) But when women—and especially women of color—raise concerns about their health and demand they be investigated, they are much likelier than men to be brushed aside, not believed, even mocked into silence by health-care professionals. According to author Leslie Jamison, whose writings include the essay “Grand Unified Theory of Female Pain,” women’s pain3 often is “perceived as constructed or exaggerated,” and women’s symptoms may be ignored or treated less aggressively than male patients’ would be.When women suffer cardiac arrest in public settings, they’re less likely than men to have bystanders attempt resuscitation—and more likely to die, according to a study conducted in the Netherlands and published in the European Heart Journal. One probable reason: Bystanders who see a woman collapse don’t realize she’s having a cardiac arrest (heartbeat that gets fast and irregular, then stops) and so don’t call for help or try a defibrillator to restore normal rhythm. As a result, men have about twice the chance that women have of living long enough to get out of the hospital. —Patricia EdmondsFor decades, studies have found that women are significantly more likely than men to be undertreated for pain. 1989: Research on a group divided evenly between men and women found that in the three days after they had coronary bypass surgery, the men were twice as likely as the women to be given narcotics for pain. 1996: A 20-month study at a hospital emergency department found that among people who reported acute chest pain, women were less likely than men to be admitted, and also less likely to be given an exercise stress test at a follow-up visit. 2008: Research by a female emergency room doctor found that when patients came to the ER complaining of acute abdominal pain, men waited an average of 49 minutes before being given a painkiller, while women waited an average of 65 minutes. —PEThis dismissive attitude has consequences not only for women’s treatment now but also for the medical research that will produce the cures of the future. Historically in the (male-dominated) medical profession, clinical trials were conducted with male subjects; they were considered the “norm,” and their reactions to a new drug were assumed to be representative of how both sexes would react. Women of reproductive age were excluded “for safety reasons”; so were women in general, to eliminate hormonal differences as a factor in the research. In 1993 the U.S. National Institutes of Health called for women to be included in more trials. In 2016 a medical journal analysis found that clinical trials were including more women, but not always in numbers representative of the female population. It also found that the research didn’t always involve “sex-specific analysis of the safety and efficacy” of a product.We need women-specific research to help address differences in biology, and discrepancies4 in health outcomes, between women and men. Women are more likely to be diagnosed or living with chronic diseases and/or immune diseases; in the United States, 38 percent of women have one or more chronic diseases compared with 30 percent of men. Coronary artery disease causes more severe impairment and more deaths in women than in men (but greater research funding is devoted to studying it in men). New drugs and products come on the market ostensibly for women’s benefit, but some actually harm women.5 This suggests a need for more research and testing, with women playing a role as subjects and as decision-makers.Some of today’s most commonly used drugs produce different effects, and side effects, in women than in men—a variability not always considered by prescribers or communicated to patients. For example, Americans had been using the popular prescription sleep drug zolpidem (sold under names including Ambien) for more than 20 years when the Food and Drug Administration announced in 2013 that what had been the recommended dose for both sexes was actually twice as much as women should take. Similarly, research has shown that women have a 1.5 to 1.7 times higher risk of adverse drug reactions than men do. For instance, women experience liver failure caused by acetaminophen (the active ingredient in the over-the-counter analgesic Tylenol) more often and more severely than men, because men’s livers have a greater capacity to metabolize acetaminophen safely. —PE, TMNearly 47 million women in the United States ages 15 to 49 use contraception, but not every method available to them has been reliable or safe. In 2002, the FDA approved a permanent birth control product called Essure, a metal device that is inserted into the fallopian tubes, where the body covers it with scar tissue. After about three months, this creates a permanent blockage so an egg cannot pass from the ovary to the uterus. The FDA has received more than 26,000 reports of side effects attributed to Essure, including pelvic pain, allergic reactions to nickel, device breakage, and pregnancy. By the end of 2018, Essure use was considered a possible factor in 15 women’s deaths. Sales of the product ended in the United States in December 2018; a study of its long-term effects is ongoing. —TMIn certain girls and women who turn up at hospital emergency departments, physicians see health problems that probably are treatable. But the social and cultural crises that complicate these patients’ lives often seem to defy resolution.Jo is so frightened of her past that she has run away from it, changed her name, and disguised her identity. She was a victim of intimate partner violence so severe that she was hospitalized multiple times and feared for her life. Emergency physicians see plenty of domestic violence victims, some with bruises and broken bones, others with unseen scars. But Jo’s not a patient; she’s a physician on the hospital staff. She belies the common misconception that domestic violence occurs mostly in poor, uneducated households. The reality is that on average in the United States, about 20 persons every minute are abused by an intimate partner. And worldwide, domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women—more than accidents, muggings, or assaults by strangers.Nadia is a 10-year-old girl who is outside an emergency department, alone and apparently in pain, when a stranger alerts the doctors. An exam shows the girl has a large abdominal tumor and needs emergency surgery. Hospital staff is about to summon child protective services when the “stranger” confesses: She is Nadia’s mother, afraid to show herself because of her undocumented status. This fear of deportation is also why she waited so long to get Nadia examined. Because of the delay, the procedure is much more costly (both physically and financially) than open and preventive medical care would be.Today’s immigration crises have no simple remedies. But when undocumented U.S. residents lack access to preventive medicine and care, they bring all their care needs to emergency departments—where use by the uninsured costs about $38 billion a year more than non-emergency care would.Uninsured patients suffer from lack of health-care access, and a woman’s risk of being uninsured increases if she has a low income or is Hispanic/Latina. Women living in rural communities are more likely than women in other areas to struggle with poor health; they have limited access to mammograms and other screenings, and maternity care, because only 6 percent of the nation’s ob-gyns work in rural settings.Other factors discourage women from accessing the system. Although the Affordable Care Act attempted to lower financial barriers, seeking care still takes money—for childcare, transportation, and out-of-pocket costs. That can be prohibitive for women because they often earn lower wages, have fewer financial assets, and have higher rates of poverty than men. In the United States, a woman also is statistically likelier than a man to be covered by health insurance as a dependent and is thus at greater risk of losing coverage if she then is widowed or divorced or if her policy-holding spouse or partner becomes unemployed. For these reasons and more, about one in four U.S. women has had to delay or forgo health care in the past year because of costs, a Kaiser Women’s Health Survey found.In the quest for wellness, women contend with one variable that men do not: a reproductive system designed to bear offspring. Whether or not they ever give birth, most women are equipped to do so for some portion of their lives. Depending upon circumstances, that can become a blessing, a burden, a political football, a societal issue. Ultimately, it’s the most personal health issue of all.Arizona is a pediatric surgeon who loves kids and wants to have her own with her same-sex spouse. Fortunately for them, and for singles and couples who need help to conceive, there are options, including surrogacy, embryo donation, egg donation—and sperm donation, a global industry valued at about four billion dollars. Arizona and her partner decide on sperm donation. She has an IUI (intrauterine insemination) and is elated when her pregnancy test is positive. Unfortunately, on her first ultrasound, there is no heartbeat.Infertility6—not being able to get pregnant or to sustain a pregnancy—affects about 10 percent of U.S. women ages 15 to 44 (some 6.1 million women), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the good news about infertility is that the majority of cases can be treated by conventional therapies such as surgery or medication (and only 3 percent require the use of in vitro fertilization, or IVF). Compared with decades ago, there’s much more hope.If a woman is unable to get pregnant after one year of trying, she and her partner may be facing infertility. In the United States, about 8 percent of infertility cases are caused by a male factor alone. Risk factors for male infertility include obesity and substance use, but some risks are beyond an individual’s control. A study conducted in Sweden found that men with fathers who smoked had a 50 percent lower sperm count than those with nonsmoking fathers. And while men can avoid the high temperatures of hot tubs, climate change may also pose a risk. A 2018 study in beetles found that one heat wave reduced sperm production by about 75 percent, but females were not affected. —TMWhat of the women who don’t want children yet? Or ever? Roughly 60 percent of U.S. women ages 15 to 44 years use a contraceptive method, the Guttmacher Institute reports. And of women in that age range, the abortion rate in 2017 was 13.5 abortions per thousand—the country’s lowest rate ever.Cristina is a take-no-prisoners kind of person who proclaims herself “childless by choice.” Even when she was married to a man she deeply loved, and he wanted a child, she stayed true to herself (at the price of the marriage). She aligns with the growing wave of women who, for a variety of reasons, are voluntarily child free—a decision as valid as the opposite choice.Then there are the postponers, those who want to wait to bear children after a career or for other reasons. My advice to them: Look at what the current generation of older, professional women has gone through. Women who wait too long have a much harder time getting pregnant (and it gets very expensive—the average cost of a single IVF treatment is around $12,000). Even with my medical training, I looked at the age-at-conception statistics and somehow thought they didn’t apply to me. Certainly I’d be like the people in the media, or the television characters I write for, who get pregnant at the drop of a hat no matter their age. Guess what? Wrong!Here’s the truth: A woman’s best reproductive years are in her 20s. Fertility gradually declines in the 30s, as both the quality and quantity of her eggs decrease. Each month that she tries to get pregnant, a healthy, fertile 30-year-old woman has a 20 percent chance of doing so. By age 40, a woman’s chance is less than 5 percent a cycle.This is why I’m a strong advocate of fertility preservation7 via egg or embryo freezing, to avoid “panic parenting” moves such as entering into unwise relationships just to have a child. Izzie, a surgical resident struggling to beat stage 4 melanoma, has her eggs removed to preserve future fertility if she survives her treatments. Others use the technology in less dire circumstances. Yes, egg and embryo freezing are expensive processes, and not a guarantee, but they do offer a choice. Think of them as investments in your future life!For women struggling with infertility or maternity issues, a fledgling “femtech” industry is developing new devices and services. Computer apps and wearable monitors track a woman’s fertile periods—or, once she’s pregnant, her unborn baby’s development. A cloud-based company offers all-in-one clinical and financial plans for patients having IVF or egg freezing.Increasingly, would-be parents get embryos or gametes tested for chromosomal abnormalities before deciding whether to use them. In a U.K. study reported last year in Human Reproduction, about a third of patients who chose to test expressed some regret that they’d done so—especially if abnormalities were revealed, but even if they weren’t. As a result, study authors suggested that “additional counselling and support” be offered in concert with testing. —PEFor those who have the desire and have timed everything right, there’s the joy of pregnancy and birth. But even these happy times can be scary. Karen is a quirky woman married to the love of her life, a paramedic who rushes to her bedside when she is in labor. He gets there in time to witness the birth of their baby girl, and it’s a happy day for all until Karen starts feeling some pain that doesn’t seem right. She begins bleeding profusely so is taken to the operating room, where doctors perform a hysterectomy. After the operation, she suffers multiple-organ failure and has a cardiac arrest from which she does not recover. Karen dies of pre-eclampsia, a high blood pressure disorder that can be treated if caught soon enough.Maternal mortality statistics track what fraction of deaths of women ages 15 to 49 are maternity related. From 2000 to 2017, maternal mortality decreased significantly in the world overall—but increased in the United States. Many elements contribute to such increases; among them are obesity, chronic conditions, socioeconomic factors, access to care, and having children at older ages. Even so, the CDC estimates that about 60 percent of maternal deaths are preventable. And between white women and women of color, the discrepancy is staggering, with black women three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth complications.Our health-care system has done a wonderful job of protecting and improving the outcomes for newborns and preterm babies, but at the expense of ignoring the mothers. In 2018 Congress took a step in the right direction, passing legislation to fund and support states’ efforts to reduce maternal deaths.Just as they’re integral when new lives enter the world, women are guardians and anchors when long lives reach the end. Women tend to live longer than men (those 85 and older outnumber their male counterparts two to one). Many are doubly exposed to health-care problems because they’re caring for the young and the old in addition to themselves. Ellis is an award-winning, intelligent, driven surgeon in the prime of her career when she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s dementia.8 It ruins her career and eventually leads to the end of her life. Alzheimer’s disease disproportionately affects women, on two levels. Almost two-thirds of adults 65 or older with the disease are women. And of the more than 16 million Americans who provide unpaid care to a person with Alzheimer’s or other dementias, 66 percent are women.Women outnumber men roughly two to one among Americans with Alzheimer’s disease, and scientists are unraveling the factors behind this disparity. Lifestyle may play a role: Women who spent time in the paid workforce show less memory decline than those who didn’t. But physiological factors also differ. The cognitive tests used to catch the disease early are less effective for women because they tend to have better verbal memory than men, and catching the disease later may lead to faster cognitive decline. There are also different genetic risk factors for men and women. And compared with men’s brains, the connections in women’s brains might provide paths for greater spread of protein plaques. —TMAs Americans over 65 become a larger share of the population, that almost certainly will mean more women with Alzheimer’s and fewer younger women to be caregivers. It’s one more reason to take a hard look now at our approaches to health and wellness needs, and make improvements.In 2015, United Nations member states agreed to try to provide basic health care for every child, man, and woman by 2030. Today, when hundreds of millions of people can’t find or afford health care, we’re a long way from that. But it’s a goal worth fighting for. Each of us can start by advocating for what she personally needs, and what her family and community and country will need, to live lives of health and well-being.On Grey’s Anatomy a few seasons ago, Meredith Grey—the Meredith I mentioned earlier—barely survives a brutal assault. When she recovers, she offers some powerful advice about the importance of speaking up. I’ll give her the last word here:“Don’t let fear keep you quiet. You have a voice, so use it. Speak up. Raise your hands. Shout your answers. Make yourself heard.”",
"There are times when flip-flops and sweatpants seem appropriate. At a Saturday afternoon picnic in the park. Or at the county fair. Or when you’re a couple preparing for the arrival of Baby Number Two. Comfort is key.But something made Kira Johnson, 39, change her mind on the evening of April 11, 2016.“Babe, I want to look really pretty for Langston,” she told her husband, Charles Johnson IV, as she sat before her bedroom mirror brushing her hair. The next afternoon they would head to Los Angeles’s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for the birth of their second son.They were committed to raising “men that would leave a mark on the world and who have a sense of purpose and responsibility far beyond themselves,” Charles explains.Baby Number One, born in 2014 by emergency cesarean section, was named Charles Spurgeon Johnson V, after his great-great-grandfather, the famed sociologist and first black president of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. His little brother would be named after the legendary Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes. Kira packed jewelry and a dress so she could bring him home in style. Charles decided he needed to dress the part too. “You never know when you need to look like you have a little bit of sense and a little bit of money,” Johnson recalls thinking, as he scrapped the basketball shorts and T-shirt for a button-down shirt, slacks, and loafers.The choice was as mindful as the selection of Cedars-Sinai, consistently ranked among the best hospitals in the United States. When you have all the other bases covered—a healthy mom, a healthy baby, the best prenatal care available—why not put the icing on the cake by having your baby at a world-class facility?Langston Emile Johnson was born at 2:33 p.m. on April 12, 2016. The scheduled C-section seemed routine, and Kira was able to breastfeed just after giving birth. She helped introduce Langston to his 18-month-old brother before drifting off to sleep.Charles was sitting beside his wife’s bed when he noticed blood in her catheter. It was after 4 p.m. when he first told a nurse about it, according to a complaint Charles filed in 2017 with a lawsuit he brought against Cedars-Sinai. Also included in the complaint are details about the care Kira received: The catheter was changed at about 5:30 p.m. and was followed by an ultrasound and blood work. The ultrasound showed signs of internal bleeding. Pain medication and intravenous fluids were administered. A CT scan was ordered at 6:44 p.m. Ultrasounds and blood work were repeated. A blood transfusion was given. Another four hours and still no CT scan. Another blood transfusion was given, according to the complaint. Kira was “pale and groggy,” Charles says, adding that she was “shivering uncontrollably.” Her abdomen was painful to the touch. Charles says he repeatedly asked hospital staff what was being done to identify the source of her bleeding.“As a father and a husband, there’s a fine line between trying to advocate for your wife and crossing a line, particularly as a black man,” he recalls. Charles says he did not want to do anything that would be detrimental to his wife’s care.Especially, Charles says, after one staff member answered his anxious query by saying, “Sir, your wife’s just not a priority right now.”The CT scan never happened, according to the complaint. Kira was taken into surgery around 12:30 a.m., 10 hours after the C-section. Her abdomen was full of blood. Her last words to her husband, he says, were, “Baby, I’m scared.”His wife’s fear rattled Charles, because bravery defined her: Kira had lived in China, spoke five languages, had a pilot’s license, and had driven race cars. But he assured her everything would be OK.Kira died at 2:22 a.m. on April 13.“‘We did everything we could to save your wife, but we couldn’t save her,’” Charles recalls the doctor telling him. It was “like watching my whole world crumble around me. It was like a bomb went off, and I see her mother fall on the floor, her aunt screaming, her brother just breaking.”Surrounded by photos of his late wife, Kira Johnson, Charles Johnson IV, 37, plays with their children, Charles V, three (in lap), and Langston, two, at home in Atlanta, Georgia. Following an uncomplicated pregnancy, Kira died from internal bleeding 12 hours after delivering Langston by C-section.“We were so prepared. We had this. We had the best of everything. We did everything right. And they’re standing there telling me they lost her?” Charles says.According to the complaint, the autopsy determined that Kira died of internal bleeding after her C-section. Racial bias is not part of the complaint. A trial is scheduled for January. In October, the Medical Board of California found Arjang Naim, the attending physician who oversaw Kira’s care, to be grossly negligent. Naim said Kira Johnson’s death was unfortunate, adding that he did not expect her to pass away on the operating table during surgery. “I did as much as possible to take the best care of the patient,” he said. Naim was put on probation for four years.A hospital spokesperson would not comment on the specifics of the case but said in a statement that “Kira Johnson’s death was a tragedy. We thoroughly investigate any situation where there are concerns about a patient’s medical care. Based on our findings, we make any changes that are needed so that we can continue to provide the highest quality care to our patients. This includes reviewing hospital procedures as well as the competency of health care providers.”Kira’s death was shocking but underscores a harsh reality: At a time when the pace of medical advances can be breathtaking—from genetic testing that can predict the likelihood of conditions to treatments that have never been more effective in targeting cancer and other diseases—the rate of maternal deaths remains stubbornly high in the United States: about 14 deaths for every 100,000 live births. Among 46 developed nations, the World Health Organization says, only Serbia and the United States had maternal death rates that worsened between 1990 and 2015. This rate includes mothers who die of complications within six weeks of the end of the pregnancy.In the United States the problem is marked by two particularly alarming statistics: African-American women are about three times as likely to die of pregnancy-related causes as white women, and more than 60 percent of maternal deaths are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“We have higher maternal mortality than much of the rest of the developed world; we are capable of doing the best in the world,” says William Callaghan, the CDC’s chief of maternal and infant health. The CDC defines a pregnancy-related death as a woman who dies while pregnant or within one year of the end of her pregnancy.“When deaths are reviewed and we see what the contributing factors were, there are so many instances where communication was not carried out correctly, where people didn’t recognize urgency, or when the patient wasn’t listened to, or the delay in reaction.”The maternal mortality rate for the United States remains far below those of developing nations in Africa, where 20 countries have maternal death rates of at least 500 deaths for every 100,000 live births. But even in those countries, where medical facilities and access to basic care often are lacking, maternal mortality rates have declined since 1990 by an average of almost 40 percent, thanks in part to low-tech solutions such as midwives and improvements in prenatal and postpartum care.All women are vulnerable to the same pregnancy-related health conditions that can lead to death: postpartum hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding; preeclampsia, or dangerously high blood pressure; and sepsis stemming from an infection. So why are the maternal mortality rates for African-American women so high?Researchers say the toxic stress that racial and ethnic minorities, including African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans, experience—regardless of economic or social success—can erode their physical health. It’s known as “weathering,” a concept developed by University of Michigan professor of public health Arline Geronimus that suggests the health of African Americans deteriorates earlier than that of whites because of the cumulative effects of racism and bias. It may help explain why even black mothers with the highest levels of education are dying at higher rates than white women with the least education.Valerie Montgomery Rice, president and dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, believes that not only do bias and racism build up to affect the health of black women over time, but that stress from racism and poverty may have adverse effects as early as in utero or soon after a baby is born.She also points out that unconscious bias from medical providers can affect the care black mothers receive. While training at Grady Memorial Hospital, she saw that providers would occasionally withhold epidurals and local anesthetics from African-American women. “You have people who believe that black women don’t experience pain the same way because they have higher muscle mass, that their pain fibers don’t fire as much. ‘That woman can push that baby out—she’s a big girl.’” Summing up, Montgomery Rice says, “They didn’t see the person in their totality.”In developing countries, maternal deaths are vastly more prevalent and an accepted fact of life. Health care infrastructure is often sparse or nonexistent. Quality prenatal care and pregnancy information can be limited. More than 9,000 miles from Los Angeles, the dusty highway between Somaliland’s capital, Hargeisa, and its third largest city, Borama, pierces the horizon like an arrow. The landscape is dotted sparsely with thorny acacia trees, and the sun beats down like a drum.Venture off the paved surface, and the only roads are rocky and perilous, sure to scar the undercarriage of all but the sturdiest utility vehicle. It’s hard to imagine a woman in labor surviving the journey, in a vehicle or on foot, from a remote rural area to a health facility. Somaliland is a self-declared nation in the Horn of Africa, though it is widely viewed internationally as an autonomous region within Somalia.The main causes of maternal deaths in Somaliland are eclampsia (seizures or convulsions due to high blood pressure), hemorrhage, infection, and ruptured uterus. Other reasons include early or too many pregnancies, unassisted deliveries, and complications from female genital mutilation (FGM), a practice of removing external genitalia of girls and women in order to make them “pure” and suitable for marriage. The scarred tissue can narrow the birth canal, complicating childbirth.In Somaliland, consent for C-sections or any kind of lifesaving procedure, including a blood transfusion or surgery, has to be obtained from a male relative financially responsible for a woman’s health, such as her husband or a man from her husband’s side of the family.That is the landscape into which Edna Adan Ismail, the eldest of three children in a wealthy family, was born.Her father, Adan Ismail, was the most senior Somaliland health professional in the former British protectorate, which declared its independence in 1960. Of her mother’s five deliveries, one girl died during a forceps delivery in a hospital, a procedure that had almost killed Adan. Another died after being dropped on his head by a midwife.Education traditionally was considered useless for girls, but Ismail encouraged it for all his children. He was furious upon returning home from a business trip when Adan was about eight years old to learn that her mother and grandmother had arranged for her to undergo FGM.In 1954, at 17, Adan left Hargeisa to train as a nurse and midwife in London, England. Adan wanted to prevent girls and women from experiencing the trauma she endured during and after receiving “the cut,” as she calls FGM.Now 81, Adan will tell you that her greatest achievement was not when she was Somaliland’s first female cabinet member. Her ultimate fulfillment comes from living at the Edna Adan University Hospital in Hargeisa as its on-site administrator. She rises every day before dawn and will not refuse a 9 p.m. meeting if it’s in service of her maternity hospital.Adan says she begged, borrowed, and used her savings and pension to build the hospital.“The two main killers of pregnant women are poverty and ignorance,” Adan says, striking a regal pose from behind her desk. “A combination of those two kill more women than eclampsia or postpartum hemorrhage. So when you have a woman who’s illiterate, who’s poor—in Somaliland she’s also likely to be a nomad—she’s also lived a life where she’s never had any social justice. Superimpose on that a pregnancy that may have arrived when her body was not fully ready to receive a pregnancy. We delivered a woman here who was having baby number 21.”Or she may be like the mother of the midwife and chief anesthetist at Edna Adan University Hospital, 27-year-old Hamda Omar Mohammed.Omar’s mother, Samsam Mohammed, cooked for the construction crew as the hospital was being built in 2002, and Adan struck up an acquaintance. When Mohammed was not at her usual spot one day, Adan wondered why.Mohammed was at home, bleeding nearly to death. A neighbor who had come to help had pulled on the umbilical cord when trying to deliver the placenta. The cord became detached, and Mohammed began to bleed. Mohammed’s husband ran to get help. Omar, then 11 and the eldest child of four, stayed behind to clean up the blood and look after her siblings. Adan arranged transportation to a government hospital, even donating her own blood to help save Mohammed.Omar’s mother survived. Years later Adan persuaded that traumatized girl to become a midwife, one of the 938 she has helped train in Somaliland so far. “If I can help train a million midwives on the African continent, it will change the experience of childbirth. It will end the suffering for so many women and families.”Over the swoosh, swoosh sound of a fetal monitor, Jontelle Gallman’s voice is surprisingly calm. The Washington, D.C., native checked into the George Washington University Hospital on a cloudy Tuesday morning in May, three days after heavy rains flooded her two-bedroom home. Gallman, 39, spent the weekend before her scheduled induced delivery searching for a new place to live.The mother of three had maintained steady employment as a retail clerk and manager in the two decades since high school, often working 50-hour weeks and providing a good life for her family until 2015. Soon after, doctors diagnosed her with polycystic kidney and liver disease, a chronic genetic condition that causes cysts to grow in those organs.Too sick to work and relying on Medicaid, the U.S. assistance program that provides health coverage to those with low incomes, Gallman was in the late stages of pregnancy with her fourth child when doctors identified a problem she’d faced previously: dangerously high blood pressure. Without a car and with meager finances, she depended on public transportation and support from friends and family to get to medical appointments and care for her children.“I just felt like as hard as I had worked to keep things together, life was trying to defeat me,” she says. “But I wasn’t going to let that happen.”Standing in Gallman’s hospital room through most of the 12 hours of her labor and delivery, I couldn’t help thinking about my own mother, Eloise Blocker Jones. I am the ninth of her 10 children and one of the only three born in a hospital. We all had been born in poverty in Cairo, Illinois, a small town where the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers meet that is known for its tumultuous racial history.When Mama died in 2005, it never occurred to me that I would one day want to ask her about her pregnancy and childbirth experiences. After all, she had done her best to drum independence and self-sufficiency into each of her five daughters. Pregnancy before marriage was unthinkable, but to hear Mama tell it, it wasn’t exactly a picnic afterward either. I long to ask my mother how she felt as a 19-year-old about to deliver my eldest brother in 1947, far away from her family and friends in Philadelphia. Now I wonder how she endured as a poor woman with no family planning advice, no parenting education, no health insurance.When Gallman’s Medicaid case manager recommended that she contact the Mamatoto Village maternity-support organization in Washington, D.C., she thought she might be able to get some nutritional advice that could improve her diet and boost her energy.What Gallman got was a lifeline in the form of a perinatal community health worker named Briana Green.The 39-year-old former corporate lawyer with a waist-length ponytail and a ballet dancer’s stride now enters Labor and Delivery Room 8 and heads straight for Gallman’s belly, rubbing it gently while also reaching for her hand.“How are you holding up?” she asks, peering intently at her client through eyelids strained from lack of sleep. At any given time, Green works with about 50 pregnant or postpartum women, making home visits and offering counseling, education, and support. She accompanies them to doctor’s visits and is present during delivery.Green may have been destined for this life: Her great-grandmother Nancy Gayles Burton had 17 children and was a revered granny midwife in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, in the 1920s and 1930s.Green says she gave up a six-figure income in law and later selling real estate to train as a perinatal-support worker because of her own birth experiences. She says she was denied the opportunity to try for a vaginal delivery after a cesarean section, even after following guidelines to ensure she was physically prepared.“I realized that if I, as an educated African-American woman with some financial security, couldn’t be seen or heard or respected, what about women who didn’t have a voice, who were probably being dismissed and mistreated from the minute they entered a health care setting?”Jessica Flowers is only seven years old, but she’s strong, her grandmother Nicole Black says. Black will never forget how calm the little girl was when she called at 1:46 a.m. on July 4, 2018.“She said, ‘Mommy’s fallen over in the tub, and she has foam coming out of her mouth,’” recalls Black, who’s 53 and lives in Tampa, Florida. A week earlier, Black’s daughter, Crystle Galloway, had delivered her third child, a healthy six-pound, four-ounce boy named Jacob Flowers, by cesarean section at St. Joseph’s Hospital.Black scrambled out of bed and over the short distance to Galloway’s apartment, where the 30-year-old mother was slumped over the bathtub.Just a few hours earlier, Galloway had been sitting on the couch watching a movie and talking about the Fourth of July menu. She’d had a bit of pain from the C-section incision, but otherwise Galloway had been so happy, so proud to complete her family of two girls by adding a son.Exactly what happened in the minutes between when fire medics, dispatched for a possible stroke victim, according to a Hillsborough County, Florida, official statement, arrived at Galloway’s home and when she was evaluated at an emergency room three blocks away was the focus of an investigation by Hillsborough County officials.Black says that instead of checking Galloway’s vital signs and transporting her to a hospital, the medics asked whether her family could afford to pay the $600 ambulance fee. Black says that she begged medics to take her daughter in the ambulance.At a press conference, Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill said that there was confusion about transport and that a conversation about cost was between Black and sheriff’s deputies who arrived first on the scene and not with medics, according to the medics’ and deputies’ statements. Merrill also noted that fire medics admitted that Galloway nodded yes when they asked her directly if she wanted to be transported to the hospital. Merrill said the medics should have obtained an informed refusal document for them not to take her in the ambulance, and that did not happen. Black wound up driving her daughter to the emergency room. Galloway then was taken by helicopter to Tampa General Hospital, where she slipped into a coma. She died five days later.Hillsborough County announced in September that it had taken disciplinary action against the four medics for violating standard operating procedure by failing to check Galloway’s vital signs, for falsifying documents, and for not having Black sign an informed refusal document for declining the ambulance ride for her daughter.One medic was terminated; two were demoted. The three medics still on staff were suspended without pay for 30 days.Better and sustained health care support during mothers’ pregnancies and after they give birth seems a logical solution to help lower U.S. maternal mortality rates, but it’s not that simple. Doulas and midwives can charge upwards of $1,500 for their services, and many low-income mothers simply can’t afford that. California has made progress reducing the number of maternal deaths in the state by adding routine protocols at participating hospitals for common pregnancy complications such as hemorrhage and preeclampsia. Procedures such as measuring blood loss or administering high-blood-pressure medication when needed to prevent preeclampsia are part of a set of practices that medical facilities sometimes ignore or delay.And as Charles Johnson says, simply listening to mothers and families is also important.Every day Charles spends time reading, dancing, or playing with his sons in a light-filled room adorned with poster-size photos of Kira posing with family and friends, her smile beaming brighter than the sun’s rays. The boys often ask whether Mommy would have liked this song or whether she would have liked playing with their race cars.Now raising his young sons alone, Charles devotes most of his time to telling Kira’s story to health officials, advocacy groups, and even the U.S. Congress.“More than anything I want people to understand that these women we’re losing are more than statistics,” he says.“They’re mothers, they’re daughters, they’re sisters, they’re friends,” he says. “And they’re leaving behind these precious children, and there’s no statistic that can quantify what it’s like to tell an 18-month-old that Mommy’s not coming home. Or to tell a two-year-old, who never will know his mom, how amazing she is.”",
"Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the United States and nations around the world have made significant progress in protecting the environment.However, there is much work to be done, and new challenges have emerged. In this timeline, we examine the progress—and the setbacks—over the past 50 years.1970: First Earth Day On April 22, an estimated 20 million people march in U.S. streets to call attention to the urgent need for environmental protections.1970: “Environmental Magna Carta” The National Environmental Policy Act takes effect in the U.S. It requires environmental impact assessments for federally permitted projects such as roads and dams.1972: Cleaning up rivers The Clean Water Act regulates pollution and leads to major cleanups in U.S. rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and coastal areas. Some even become fishable and swimmable again.1972: U.S. bans notorious pesticide Silent Spring had called for it; the new EPA does it: DDT is declared to be dangerous to wildlife, the environment, and potentially humans.1972: Defending marine mammals The Marine Mammal Protection Act shields declining populations—whales, dolphins, seals, and manatees—from hunting and harassment in U.S. waters. Their numbers begin a decades-long recovery.1973: Saving species The Endangered Species Act limits encroachment on the habitat of listed animals and plants. It prevents extinctions—but is attacked for infringing on property rights.1976: Chemical plant accident in Seveso, Italy Toxic vapors expose thousands of people to some of the highest dioxin levels ever recorded.1978: Love Canal furor Buried toxic chemicals sicken hundreds of residents in the community of Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York, calling attention to the dangers of industrial waste.1979: Three Mile Island A partial meltdown at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant kills no one—but sours many Americans on nukes.1980: Alaska wildlands protected The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act sets aside more than 100 million acres of wilderness in national parks, preserves, and refuges.1980: Superfund program launched The fund enables the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to clean up hazardous waste sites. Polluters must perform the cleanup or pay for it.1985: Discovery of the ozone hole  Scientists detect severe depletion (red) of the protective ozone layer above Antarctica. The culprits: chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals.1986: Chernobyl nuclear accident A nuclear reactor explodes at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union. The blast and radiation kill 30 and force the evacuation of nearly 1,100 square miles—raising more doubts about nuclear power.1987: Rescuing condors The last 27 California condors are taken into captivity for breeding. A long recovery begins; today more than 200 live in the wild once again.1987: Montreal protocol World leaders agree to phase out ozone-depleting substances just a few years after the ozone hole is found. All nations ratify the treaty.1988: Greenhouse effect detected NASA climatologist James Hansen tells the U.S. Congress that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases released by the burning of fossil fuels are already warming the planet.1989: “Exxon Valdez” The supertanker spills 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska.1990: Ban on international trade in elephant ivory It briefly slows poaching of African elephants. By 2016 Kenya is burning ivory to deter poaching.1990: First IPCC projection The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues its initial global warming report. Over the next quarter century, its forecasts mostly come true.1990: Fighting acid rain Amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act help reduce acid rain and ozone depletion, require cleaner gasoline, and target toxic emissions and urban air pollution.1991: Bringing ferrets back Black-footed ferrets, once extinct in the wild, are reintroduced to the American West by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists after a captive-breeding program. They remain endangered.1991: Kuwait oil fires As the Persian Gulf War winds down, Iraq sets more than 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire. Some 1.5 billion barrels of oil are burned or spilled.1995: Amazon forest loss The deforestation rate rises dramatically, mostly to create cattle pasture, presaging a surge in Brazilian beef exports. Beef becomes a prime driver of rainforest destruction.1995: Wolves return to Yellowstone Reintroduced to the national park, gray wolves help rebalance an ecosystem suffering from an overpopulation of elk.1995: Bald eagle recovery The American national bird is reclassified from endangered to merely threatened. Later it is delisted completely—one of about 90 animal and plant species so far to reach that goal.1996: Leaded gas ban in U.S. It caps a long phaseout that caused blood lead levels to plummet. Most of Europe follows in 2000.1997: Amphibian apocalypse Scientists confirm that the skin-eating chytrid fungus spread by humans has been killing hundreds of varieties of frogs and salamanders. Ninety species have gone extinct to date, making it one of the most destructive known pathogens.1997: Kyoto Protocol To address climate change, 37 nations and the European Community pledge to cut CO2 emissions. The U.S. later fails to ratify the treaty.1999: Golden rice Rice is genetically engineered with vitamin A to boost nutrition in the diets of Africans and Asians.2000: The hybrid revolution Toyota’s Prius, the first mass-produced car with both a gasoline engine and an electric motor, arrives in the U.S. and becomes an icon of fuel efficiency.2002: California goes solar The state commits to getting 20 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2017. It exceeds the target—and raises it to 100 percent by 2045.2002: Larsen B ice shelf collapses A NASA satellite documents the breakup in a month of a 1,250-square-mile ice shelf floating off the rapidly warming Antarctic Peninsula.2005: Hurricane Katrina America’s costliest storm kills 1,833 people and floods 80 percent of New Orleans.2006: Al Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth helps raise public awareness about the threat of climate change and wins an Academy Award for best documentary feature. But the moment passes without significant progress in addressing the threat.2006: Toxic waste in Côte d’Ivoire Waste containing hydrogen sulphide and other chemicals is dumped near the port city of Abidjan. It kills 15 and sickens 100,000.2006: China rising With soaring coal use fueling a booming economy, China passes the U.S. to become the largest emitter of CO2. Its per capita emissions remain far lower.2006: Shark finning Scientists calculate that 26 million to 73 million sharks are killed annually for their fins. The shocking numbers raise alarm about shark populations.2006: Honeybee colonies collapse Beekeepers begin reporting the mysterious disappearance of worker bees, which is leading to the collapse of many colonies.2006: White-nose syndrome A fungus starts killing millions of American bats of several species, including endangered little brown bats.2008: Electric cars get cool Tesla Motors, founded in 2003, releases its first car, the completely electric two-door Roadster. In company tests, the sports car travels 245 miles on a single charge, an unprecedented range for a mass-produced electric car.2008: Global seed bank The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opens deep inside an Arctic mountain. Operated by Norway, it can store the frozen seeds of up to 4.5 million crops as an insurance policy for future generations.2010: Deepwater Horizon oil spill An oil rig explosion kills 11 workers and spews more than 130 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the largest spill in U.S. history.2011: Fukushima disaster An earthquake and a tsunami trigger the partial meltdown of three reactors at a Japanese power plant and massive discharges of radioactive material into the air and sea.2012: Hurricane Sandy New York floods; damages reach $73 billion.2012: Arctic sea ice extent It shrinks in September to a record minimum, about two Alaska-areas less than average.2015: Paris climate agreement Leaders of 195 nations agree to cap global warming at two degrees Celsius. Many countries later announce emissions cuts—though not enough to meet the two-degree goal. President Donald Trump announces that the U.S. will withdraw.2016: Larsen C ice shelf cracks After the Larsen B collapse in 2002, the next massive ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula begins to crack—just as expected from climate change.2016: Mammal extinction It’s the first caused by climate change: the Bramble Cay melomys, an Australian rodent.2017: U.K. coal decline For the first time since the 1880s, the home of the industrial revolution goes a day without making electricity from coal. The government aims to shut all coal plants by 2025.2019: Meatless burgers ...hit the mainstream.2019: Amazon rainforest wildfires Fires linked to deforestation blanket much of Brazil in smoke, stoking fears that parts of the rainforest could turn to dry savanna.2019: Australian wildfires They burn an area larger than Iceland, killing up to a billion animals.",
"This critically endangered South China tiger lives at the Suzhou Zoo in China. This is a species that may be gone from the wild now. As of 2015 there were only 100 in captivity.Whether a species is endangered—meaning at risk of extinction—depends on which definition you use. The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species classifies an animal as endangered when its numbers in the wild have dropped so low that it’s at “extremely high risk” of extinction.Meanwhile, the United States’s Endangered Species Act of 1973 takes into consideration any destruction to a species’ habitat, whether it has been over-consumed, any disease or predation that threaten it, whether any other man-made factors put it in danger, and what policies currently exist to protect it.When members of the public or a state agency propose to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service that a species be listed as endangered under the law, research and management plans are formed to help those species survive. It is illegal under the Endangered Species Act to capture, hunt, shoot, or otherwise harm an animal that’s listed as endangered.Sometimes, federal agencies decide that although a species could be considered endangered, other species are higher priorities. In those cases, the animal or plant gets limited protections.One animal whose numbers have increased through conservation is the bald eagle. There were only about 500 bald eagles in the continental United States in the 1960s because of pesticides that damaged the shells of their eggs. Conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, habitat protection, and a ban on the insecticide DDT helped the bald eagle’s numbers soar back into the thousands.Another is the giant panda, which was declared no longer endangered in 2016 thanks to 50 years of efforts to save it.U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), who wrote the Endangered Species Act, argued that “only natural extinction is part of natural order.” Scientists believe that 227 species—including the grizzly bear, the peregrine falcon and the gray wolf—were saved from extinction in the first 33 years of the law’s existence.Still, critics argue that the act is expensive and ineffective because it protects so many species. Several federal courts have heard and rejected arguments that the Endangered Species Act is unconstitutional, and members of Congress have tried to weaken the law in small ways.Luckily for endangered species, there are many people looking out for them.

"TAR CREEK
Picher, Oklahoma
POLLUTANTS: lead, zinc, cadmium
YEAR LISTED: 1983
Dunes of waste rock from long-shuttered lead and zinc mines rise above Ethel and Fifth Streets in a town that no longer exists. Before this place became a Superfund site, children played on the dunes, and the wind blew toxic dust into homes. Water flowing through the mines still pollutes Tar Creek. But Picher’s residents are now gone, thanks to federal buyouts. Some 800 houses were razed; the town was dissolved last year.For most of his adult life Jun Apostol has lived, willingly, in the shadow of a mountain of waste. An accountant who’s now retired, he planted his family in 1978 in a modest new house in Montebello, an industrial cum bedroom community just east of Los Angeles. Behind the house, in neighboring Monterey Park, sat an active landfill—but don’t worry, the developer said. Soon it would close and become a park or maybe even a golf course.The greens never came. It turned out that the landfill, a former gravel pit that had welcomed so much ordinary trash it had filled to ground level and then kept on rising, had also accepted some 300 million gallons of liquid industrial waste—and it hadn’t been selective. Was your waste laced with arsenic, 1,4-dioxane, or mercury? No problem. The nodding pump jacks nearby, left from the oil boom, wouldn’t care. Some of the waste might have come from drilling those oil wells.Los Angeles had buried the hazardous waste, but it was far from gone. A few years after Apostol’s development was built, his neighbors began complaining of nausea. Gas had intruded into six homes. Property values plummeted. In 1986 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency marched in and listed the landfill as a Superfund site, part of its new program to contain the nation’s hazardous waste crisis.Back then many hoped the national cleanup might end after a decade or two. That didn’t happen at the Operating Industries, Inc., landfill in Monterey Park. The EPA capped the landfill with a processed-clay membrane and two feet of soil. Gases from the waste are now collected and burned; a treatment plant processes 26,000 gallons of contaminated water a day. The EPA has so far recuperated $600 million for the cleanup from various parties responsible for the waste at the site—and it does not foresee an end to its work.No one talks about the dump anymore. “People have forgotten about it,” Apostol said one afternoon in his indoor patio, with music jingling on his speakers and his small dog, in a faded “Romney 2012” sweater, yapping for attention. House prices are up again, he said, and most residents have stayed put. His wife got breast cancer, but he doesn’t blame the landfill. He’s come to respect it since the EPA intervened: It’s so heavily managed that, unlike people in neighboring towns, he doesn’t worry about mudslides.“We don’t have any regrets,” Apostol said. “Where else can you go?” He could have moved, he admitted, but the commute from Montebello was too good. Living next to a waste site may not be ideal. But neither is bad traffic.Today nearly one in six Americans lives within three miles of a major hazardous waste site, though few people could tell you where it is. These sites fall under the Superfund program, created by Congress in 1980 after a high-profile controversy at the Love Canal development in Niagara Falls, New York. Love Canal’s residents crusaded against the Hooker Chemical Company after they found barrels of its chemical waste in their backyards, which had been built on a former dump. Love Canal left many Americans wondering, Could this be happening near me?There are more than 1,700 Superfund sites, and each has a story. Some are sacrifices to national security, like the 586 square miles at Hanford, in Washington State, where reactors have made plutonium for atomic bombs since the Manhattan Project. Others are the shells of mines, like the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, excavated in pursuit of copper and now filling with water. There are chemical manufacturers, smelters, and grain elevators that were once drenched in fumigant. Water, which can spread poison, is a common theme: New York City’s Gowanus Canal is listed, as are parts of the Hudson River and the harbor of New Bedford, Massachusetts. And then there are the many, many landfills.That these contaminated places are no longer the focus of national attention is in part due to a rarely cited phenomenon: governmental competence. Despite chronic underfunding, the EPA has finished the cleanup at more than 380 sites and considers the construction of treatment facilities complete at more than 1,160 others, including Monterey Park. Not everything is rosy. Even where the waste is under control it’s still there—and the agency estimates it has 95 uncontrolled sites, where people might one day be exposed to toxics. But the urgency of the 1970s has, for the most part, passed.Money remains a constant problem. The Superfund program once had two pillars: rules that held past polluters liable for cleanup and a “Superfund”—financed by taxes on crude oil and chemicals—that gave the EPA the resources to clean up sites when it could not extract payment from the responsible parties. Congress let those taxes expire in 1995; the program is now funded by taxes collected from all Americans. It’s low on staff. The Superfund itself is nearly empty.Superfund sites have entered a mostly benign but lingering state, dwarfed in the public’s eye by issues like climate change, says William Suk, who has directed the National Institutes of Health’s Superfund Research Program since its inception in the 1980s. “It’s not happening in my backyard, therefore it must be OK,” is how Suk sees the prevailing attitude. “Everything must be just fine—there’s no more Love Canals.”Back when leaking drums were cropping up in people’s backyards, the fear was that hazardous waste would drive a cancer epidemic. That prediction hasn’t come true. Identifying a statistically significant cancer cluster is notoriously difficult, but so far at most three have been tied to hazardous waste in the U.S. (Love Canal is not one of them.) Forty percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime, mainly the result of random errors in their DNA that arise as cells divide. As a risk factor, pollution in general ranks below smoking, obesity, diet, alcohol, and several viruses.That’s not to say that hazardous waste sites are safe. Cancer is only one danger associated with them; birth defects are another. A ghost of uncertainty attends these polluted places. Suk offers the Cuyahoga River in Ohio as an example. When it caught fire in 1969, it helped lead to passage of the Clean Water Act and to cleaner rivers all over the U.S.—but it and other rivers are far from clean enough. “It’s not on fire anymore,” Suk says. “But I wouldn’t swim in it.”How do we live with contaminated land? We need to find more ways to use these brownfields instead of green ones, says ecologist Erle Ellis of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “Brownfields are important to cities,” he says. “In a sense they’re waste, but so is manure. It’s just something that needs to get recycled.”The EPA agrees. It’s seeking uses for polluted land that could remain under its oversight indefinitely. “Basically we’ll be here forever,” says Julie Santiago-Ocasio, the EPA’s site manager at Monterey Park. It costs $5.5 million a year to treat leachate and landfill gas and make sure that contaminated groundwater doesn’t spread off the site—but a small pilot plot of solar panels atop the landfill offers hope that one day it might collect a lot of solar energy as well.A more dramatic kind of reuse is happening at the former Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver. During World War II the U.S. Army made mustard gas at the site, which is about the size of Manhattan, and later the nerve gas sarin; the Shell Chemical Company produced the pesticide dieldrin there. Waste was shunted into a basin that became a black hole of contamination.When Sherry Skipper first arrived at the site as a young biologist in the early 1990s, she would often don booties, respirators, and goggles to check on starlings she was using, like canaries in a coal mine, to monitor pollution. The birds fed on worms and burrowing insects that accumulated dieldrin. Skipper remembers one damp spring in particular when the earthworms emerged—and birds that ate them fell out of trees, convulsing. “That’s never going to happen again,” she said one day last winter.The place is now a wildlife refuge, and Skipper was riding around it with its manager, David Lucas of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It’s a wholly altered landscape. The chemical facilities were razed between 1999 and 2003 and covered with a “biota barrier”—ground-up tarmac from the old Denver airport topped by four feet of soil—to keep animals from burrowing into the contamination. Native prairie grasses now whisk water away from it. On the refuge’s fringes, wells block the spread of polluted groundwater. New town houses have sprouted on the border.With the Denver skyline as a backdrop, we watched for bald eagles—up to 80 of them roost here during winter. There are bison, prairie dogs, and mule deer. People should never live on the site itself, Skipper said. But there’s an upside to that. “What are the chances,” Lucas said, “that there’d be 16,000 acres right here in the middle of Denver—undeveloped, for wildlife—if it wasn’t a Superfund site?”",
"Smoke fills the sky as Kenyan rangers stand guard over the world's largest-ever ivory burn.Nairobi, KenyaUhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya, bent over to light a tray of fuel, the eyes of a thousand observers fixated on his back. Looming in front of him was a massive tower of ivory—one of 11 starkly white pyres set up here at Nairobi National Park, a sprawling wildlife-filled oasis in Kenya’s capital city. Doused in fuel, smoke quickly began to billow from each of the intricately assembled piles. Bright orange blazes soon overtook them, blackening the formerly pristine pyramids.By the time the last flames flickered out Saturday night, Kenya reduced 105 tons of elephant ivory and 1.35 tons of rhino horn to smoldering ash—the final remains of some 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horns. As President Kenyatta said in a speech early Saturday, the burn is meant to send a strong and clear statement to the world: “For us, ivory is worthless unless it is on our elephants.”As widely reported here, Africa is in the midst of a poaching crisis, driven primarily by demand in Asia for wildlife products. Three-quarters of illegal ivory makes its way to China, while Vietnam is the largest market for rhino horn. Updated elephant population estimates, issued by the U.S. State Department in March, now hover around 400,000, indicating that one in five elephants have been killed for their tusks during the past 10 years. Last year 1,338 rhinos were killed for their horns, out of a total estimated population of just 25,600 black and white rhinos.Ivory burns and crushes have become a popular but controversial method for nations to publicly assert their opposition to the illegal wildlife trade. Nearly 20 of those events have taken place in the past 27 years, in countries ranging from the U.S. to China and Gabon to the Philippines (see timeline). Kenya’s burn on Saturday, however, is by far the largest in history (Hong Kong held the previous record, destroying 28 tons in 2014). Still, Kenya’s burned ivory represents just 5 percent of what is currently held in government stockpiles across Africa.But some nations have resisted displays such as the one Saturday, seeing them as a wasteful loss of a lucrative natural resource. Kenya’s stockpile would bring the country a windfall if sold today. South Africa, Namibia, and others—well aware of this—have held onto their ivory in hope of a future legal sale, said Paula Kahumbu, a National Geographic Emerging Explorer and CEO of WildlifeDirect, a Nairobi-based nonprofit dedicated to supporting African-led efforts to protect natural heritage.“There’s a passing of judgment from some that we’re doing the wrong thing, because Kenya is a poor country, and we could use the $150 million-odd dollars that they claim the ivory is worth to develop our nation,” President Kenyatta said. “But I would rather wait for the judgment of future generations, who I am sure will appreciate the decision we have taken today.”Countries that hoard ivory stocks “are speculators on an evil, illegal commodity,” added Richard Leakey, chairman of the Kenya Wildlife Service and chair of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University, in a speech before the burn. “There can be no justification for speculating price rises in ivory down the road, and they should be shamed out of their position once and for all.”A wildlife ranger stands guard as pyres of ivory are set ablaze in Kenya's Nairobi National Park. The country burned 105 tons of ivory and more than one ton of rhino horn.Other nations, such as Botswana—which unveiled a tusk-based sculpture in the shape of an elephant in its international airport in 2014—say they prefer instead to use ivory in new artworks, as educational tools, or in museum displays. Tshekedi Khama, Botswana’s environment minister, told the Independent last week that his country will not destroy ivory because “burning ivory would demonstrate [to communities] that [elephants have] no value.”That, however, is exactly the message Kenya wishes to deliver.There are also practical reasons for destroying ivory. Keeping that material is expensive—requiring storage space and staff to guard it—and risky, since ivory has a tendency to find its way back into the black market through theft or corruption among those meant to watch over it.“Protecting stores of ivory puts many people’s lives at risk, and making sure that it doesn’t get out has proven to be very difficult in many countries,” said Tim Tear, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa Program. “The burning of it makes absolutely clear that it’s not getting into the illegal market.”The hope is that Kenya’s burn will set an example for others to follow, encouraging formerly reluctant countries to get on board with destroying their own stockpiles.Men move confiscated ivory to secure containers from an ivory stock room at the Kenya Wildlife Services headquarters, in Nairobi.In some cases, the public is taking up that cry ahead of the government. Tanzania, for example, denied until last year that it had a poaching crisis at all, and it has long been a holdout on destroying any of its ivory. But on Thursday, the nonprofit group OKOA Tembo wa Tanzania (Save Tanzania’s Elephants) published a letter in Mwananchi, the country’s most popular newspaper, demanding the destruction of all ivory stockpiles, signed by 30 influential Tanzanians and supported by 100,000 Facebook followers.“I think public opinion will turn very dramatically against ivory,” Leakey said. “The publicity that arises from this burn will spread to every corner of the globe, and people will learn that elephants are once again in a terrible state.”In a way, this burn takes Kenya full circle. Thirty years ago, Africa faced a similar poaching crisis, one largely driven by demand for ivory in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. The price of ivory jumped by a factor of 10 from 1969 to 1973, providing impetus for unchecked killings. The following 15 years saw the collapse of many of Africa’s elephant populations, reducing continent-wide numbers by half. Desperate to stem the losses, in 1989 Kenya pioneered a radical and headline-grabbing stunt: the world’s first ivory burn.“In ’89 it was very much about shaming the people who were buying ivory, wearing ivory, and giving it as gifts—and it worked,” Kahumbu says. “Ivory is considered valuable now, but what we need is for the world to again see it as shameful.”The tusks burned Saturday came from some 6,500 elephants that died at the hands of poachers.That first burn significantly contributed to the decision months later by the body that manages the global wildlife trade, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to ban all international trade of ivory. Under that reprieve, elephant populations slowly recovered. The protection was undermined, however, in 1997 and 2000 when Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe lowered the status of their country’s elephant populations under CITES, enabling limited ivory sales to Japan in 1999 and to Japan and China in 2008.Proponents continue to argue that flooding the market with legally sourced ivory or rhino horn would curtail poaching pressure on animals while providing funds for conservation, but with the one-off ivory sales, ivory demand surged, and poaching intensified. In 2008, for example, Kenya lost 116 elephants, whereas in 2009, following the 2008 ivory sale, that number more than doubled, to 267. “Some people had this simplistic view that when they dumped ivory into China, it would depress prices and drive criminals out of business,” Kahumbu says. “But that’s not what happened: It triggered interest and caused the price to rise.”President Kenyatta is aiming for Saturday’s burn to ignite policy changes that would, once again, completely remove ivory from the market. To solidify that goal, on Friday he joined Ali Bongo Ondimba, the president of Gabon, and Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, at a conservation summit held in in Nanyuki, a town 90 miles north of Nairobi, along with international conservationists, philanthropists, and political representatives from Africa, the U.S., Europe, and China.Organized by the Giants Club, an Africa-based nonprofit dedicated to securing the continent’s remaining elephant populations, the summit provided a platform for discussing methods to end poaching and strengthening commitments to do so. At the meeting’s end, philanthropists in attendance offered around $5 million in funding and support, while Gabon pledged to double its national parks staff from 750 to 1,500, and Botswana said it will create a special intelligence unit for supporting rangers.Preparations continue for the event, which featured illegal stockpiles of ivory stacked in 11 individual pyres.“The summit and the burn are about awareness raising and demand reduction, which are critically important, but the other part is simply action,” said Robert Godec, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. “We’ll see what sort of pledges come out of this, hopefully.”At the burn, Ségolène Royal, France’s energy minister, said she will ban all sales of ivory in France, and will strongly encourage other European Union states to do the same.Plans to shut down all legal international trade in ivory have also been in the works for more than a year. In November 2014, representatives from 25 African nations signed the Contou Declaration, a joint statement calling for a global ivory ban. And earlier this week, the 27 member states of the African Elephant Coalition—a group of African countries committed to ensuring that elephants will have a future—submitted five proposals for the upcoming triennial meeting of the 182-member countries of CITES, in late September and early October in Johannesburg, South Africa.The proposals call for re-listing all remaining African elephant populations at the highest level of international protection afforded by CITES, which would effectively shut down all legal international sales of ivory. “We cannot solve this global problem alone,” said President Ondimba of Gabon in a speech before the burn. “That’s why we, with Kenya and other nations, submitted a proposal to close all ivory markets.”That plan’s success, however, is uncertain. “In terms of uplisting—good luck, but I don’t think it’ll work,” Kahumbu says. Rather than focus on CITES, she calls for China and countries in Africa and Southeast Asia to immediately shut down their domestic markets, and then work on implementing a global ivory ban.The coming months will show which, if any, of those goals are realized. But in the meantime, Kenya asserts that it will do all it can to stamp out the trade.“To lose our elephants would be to lose a key part of our heritage, and we quite simply will not allow it,” President Kenyatta said. “We will not be the Africans who stood by as that happened.”Read more stories about wildlife crime and exploitation on Wildlife Watch.

"For decades, a silent killer has slaughtered frogs and salamanders around the world by eating their skins alive. Now, a global team of 41 scientists has announced that the pathogen—which humans unwittingly spread around the world—has damaged global biodiversity more than any other disease ever recorded.The new study, published in Science on Thursday, is the first comprehensive tally of the damage done by the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal). In all, the fungi have driven the declines of at least 501 amphibian species, or about one out of every 16 known to science.Of the chytrid-stricken species, 90 have gone extinct or are presumed extinct in the wild. Another 124 species have declined in number by more than 90 percent. All but one of the 501 declines was caused by Bd.“We’ve known that's chytrid's really bad, but we didn't know how bad it was, and it's much worse than the previous early estimates,” says study leader Ben Scheele, an ecologist at Australian National University. “Our new results put it on the same scale, in terms of damage to biodiversity, as rats, cats, and [other] invasive species.”Scheele has seen the fungus's carnage firsthand. At one of his field sites in Australia, an extended El Niño fueled mass frog breeding and dispersal—letting Bd spread as never before. Before the fungus, populations of the alpine tree frog were so abundant there, he had to watch his step when he went out at night. Now, the species is nearly impossible to find.Saddened and shocked, Scheele resolved to put numbers to the decline. Four years—and innumerable email conversations—later, Scheele's team has finally combined all known reports of chytrid declines into a single consistent database, revealing Bd and Bsal's record-breaking toll.“Chytrid fungus is the most destructive pathogen ever described by science—that's a pretty shocking realization,” adds Wendy Palen, a biologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who wrote about the study for Science.The bulk of amphibian die-offs occurred in the 1980s—when the disease began to circulate around the globe—with a second uptick in mortality in South America in the mid-2000s. Many the affected frogs live in Central and South America, though outbreaks also occur across Europe, North America, Australia, and Africa. There are no known declines from Asia, where the fungus has co-existed for millions of years.What's more, the study's counts are conservative. Earlier die-offs from the 1950s and 1960s in Europe and North America aren't included for lack of evidence. And the 501 species tallied are just the ones that scientists know about. Researchers keep identifying new species of frogs—even after they've been nearly wiped out in the wild.The study's authors hope that the new research will act as a call to arms against the pandemic.“I can totally understand why some people might see this issue as too little, too late, but I strongly disagree with that, because saying that does not truly take into consideration how much worse it can still get,” says study co-author Jonathan Kolby, a National Geographic Explorer and policy specialist at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.That's why researchers are urging governments around the world to buy amphibians time by curbing the trade of wild amphibians, protecting amphibian habitats, combating invasive species that threaten amphibians, and supporting captive-breeding programs.There are hundreds of species of chytrid fungi, and most of them are unobtrusive decomposers. But Bd is an oddball: It has a fanatical taste for the proteins in amphibian skin. In the early 20th century, human activity—such as trade and war—accidentally spread the fungus around the world.Along the way, it evolved, spawning a highly virulent strain that's primarily responsible for the pandemic.Some amphibians can tolerate Bd, but in many others, it degrades the animals' permeable skin, which they use to breathe and regulate their water levels. Runaway infections trigger a death spiral that ends in cardiac arrest.A young treefrog (Boophis sp.) rests on a delicate fern frond. National Geographic grantee Jonathan Kolby, who took this picture, is researching the Bd outbreak.Not only is Bd lethal, it's also devastatingly effective at spreading. While most pathogens target specific hosts, Bd can infect at least 695 species to varying degrees. It also doesn't kill its victims quickly, which increases the odds that the fungus will spread. Species it doesn't kill, such as the American bullfrog, can act as reservoirs.In addition, the fungus can spread by touch or by water; Bd spores can swim a short distance. And if conditions are right, the fungus can live outside of its host for weeks to months—maybe even years—at a time. “In some respects, it’s the perfect pandemic recipe,” says biologist Dan Greenberg, a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University. “If it were a human pathogen, it'd be in a zombie film.”As National Geographic has previously reported, Bd snuck up on researchers much like a fictional zombie plague. Scientists first started noticing frog die-offs in the 1970s, but researchers didn't realize these “enigmatic declines” were a global phenomenon until the 1990s. Researchers described Bd in 1997; within a decade, it was the top suspect in the killings.Study co-author Karen Lips, an ecologist at the University of Maryland, watched as the fungus spread through sites she had been monitoring for more than 15 years. From 2004 to 2008, one of her sites in Panama lost more than two fifths of its amphibian species to Bd. “You get to know this system, and it’s all completely wiped out,” she says. “It’s just horrible to see that degree of change.”Similar scenes played out in the French Pyrenees, where midwife toads keel over by the hundreds on mountain lake shores. “Early in the outbreak, midwife toads would be calling at full volume—it’s a beautiful chorus. Once the disease has swept through, you don't hear any calling,” adds study co-author Mat Fisher, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The world becomes very quiet.”Researchers say that we can't reverse the damage that Bd has already done. The fungus is already worldwide, and purging it from the environment is impossible. While topical fungicides can heal Bd-stricken amphibians in the wild, they can't be applied on a global scale.In the face of this reality, the study's authors say our best bet is to greatly curtail the global trade of wild amphibians, or at the very least improve screening procedures. The pet and meat trades probably play a major role in continuing the pathogen's spread. A 2018 study confirmed that all major strains of Bd, including the one most responsible for the global pandemic, are present in pet-shop animals.The frog species Mantidactylus grandidieri is one of many that calls Madagascar home. So far, Bd does not appear to have established a major foothold on the island, but wildlife officials around the world are staying vigilant.Despite its impact, the fungus hasn't attracted the same attention as wildlife diseases such as white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that infects bats.“If you look at the number of species impacted, [white-nose syndrome] is so incredibly dwarfed by the number of amphibians—and then you look at the levels of effort and funding and attention,” says Kolby. “Why aren’t we giving that much attention to the frogs?”U.S. officials are monitoring the situation, but because Bd is already widespread in the United States, there's only so much they can do. But researchers have pointed out that Bd consists of many different lineages. One 2011 study suggested that BdGPL, the deadliest strain of all, emerged when separate Bd strains hybridized.“If we stop trying to emphasize the importance of biosecurity, disease control, and disease surveillance at the government level, it's hard to think that we're not going to have another hybrid event,” says Kolby. “That would start everything all over again: a new strain, with new virulence. That's what I find scary.”The U.S. has room to take a more proactive approach to Bsal, which has ravaged salamanders in Europe but hasn't yet been detected in the U.S., a global haven for salamander biodiversity. In 2015, U.S. government agencies formed a task force expressly focused on Bsal. In 2016, U.S. officials moved to ban the import of 201 salamander species.The U.S. is hardly alone in the fight against Bd; officials around the world are working to curb the fungus. Scientists have set up regional networks to track the fungi's spread, and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)—the non-human equivalent of the World Health Organization—has issued recommendations for how to trade amphibian products while minimizing the risk of spreading Bd. In 2015, the OIE and CITES, the treaty that oversees the global wildlife trade, signed an agreement to work more closely together.Even now, some species stand a chance of evolving resistance to Bd and Bsal. Of the 292 chytrid-stricken species that have survived, 60 show some signs of recovery.To buy critical time, Scheele says, the world needs to lessen the other threats amphibians face, from habitat loss to invasive species. In addition, captive-breeding efforts such as the Amphibian Ark could act as genetic lifeboats.But Palen notes that the basic remedies have been known for decades: “It's pretty sobering that we haven’t been able to do those sorts of obvious things,” she says. “Maybe this is a real wake-up call.”",
"2016 was an El Niño year. Scientists know that El Niño years tend to be warmer than normal, and that events can produce unusual and dramatic weather patterns around the world. But as the year progressed, alarm bells started going off for coral researchers across the Pacific. Temperature readings for oceans around the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and at islands from Fiji to Hawaii were sky-high—hotter, in many cases, than ever before recorded.Corals, which aren’t great at dealing with either extreme heat or extreme cold, languished in the tepid waters. Stressed by the heat, they started to sicken and bleach, and in some cases die. By the end of the season, before scientists’ distressed eyes, vast swaths of the Pacific’s reefs were bleached bone white.Oceans have been warming up quickly and steadily because of climate change. But in 2016, that warming was bolstered by a particularly strong El Niño event, which helped push the planet into the warmest 12-month stretch ever recorded.The effects of El Niño events ripple across the planet, changing weather patterns from Dakar to Delhi to Boston and beyond. These powerful events happen naturally, but climate change may tweak their strength and ferocity in the future.El Niño events are actually just one half—the warm, wet half—of a naturally occurring weather cycle called the “El Niño-Southern Oscillation,” or ENSO.During an El Niño event, the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean gets warmer than usual, particularly at the equator and along the coasts of South and Central America. Warm oceans lead to low pressure systems in the atmosphere above, which in turn leads to a lot of rain for the western coasts of the Americas.During some of the most famous El Niños of the past, the deluges have been so strong that entire villages have slid down mountainsides. In the 1972 to 1973 event, ocean temperatures skyrocketed off the Peruvian coast, nearly wiping out the anchoveta fishing industry, a critical one for the country. During the 1997 to 1998 El Niño, the country sustained over $3.5 billion in damage to buildings, agricultural lands, and other infrastructure. And in 2016, corals bleached across the Pacific, floods ravaged South America, and drought-fueled fires ripped across Australia.The events can last for as long as a year, though the warming tends to be strongest during the Northern Hemisphere’s fall and winter months—October through February. In fact, that timing is the source of the name: “El Niño” means “male child” in Spanish, and also refers to the baby Jesus. Fishermen in South America, who have long known and described the phenomenon, called it “El Niño” because the some of the biggest effects spin up around Christmas—and the name stuck.The other half of the ENSO phenomenon is generally called “La Niña.” It’s basically the opposite of an El Niño: Ocean temperatures along the eastern half of the tropical Pacific cool down and that part of the world dries out. The band of heat and rain swings over to the other side of the ocean, meaning that Australia, Indonesia, and southeastern Asia get wetter and warmer than usual.La Niña events tend to settle in for longer than El Niños, persisting for somewhere between nine months to two years.El Niños and La Niñas generally occur about every two to seven years. In between, ocean temperatures and rainfall patterns become more average. The patterns aren’t perfectly clear, though—a strong El Niño doesn’t necessarily mean the following La Niña will be particularly intense, and vice versa.Both El Niños and La Niñas affect weather far beyond the Pacific basin. During El Niño years, for example, fewer hurricanes whirl across the Atlantic than usual, and the ones that do are likely to be fairly weak. And rainfall patterns shift across the globe: California and the Horn of Africa dampen, for example, while the rains that generally drench India during monsoon season weaken, and the Indian subcontinent dries out slightly.At the start of an El Niño, the trade winds that usually whisk briskly across the surface of the tropical Pacific slacken. Usually, those winds push warm surface ocean waters eastward toward Asia and Australia, where they essentially get corralled into a giant warm pool by Australia to the south, the Indonesian archipelago near the equator, and southeastern Asia.In a normal year, as the trade winds drag waters from the sun-warmed surface eastward, away from the edge of South and Central America, they draw up cold water from deep below, “upwelling” the chilly, nutrient-rich seas. The trade winds also usually induce upwelling of deep, cold waters near the equator.During a normal year it’s cool and not too rainy along the western coast of the Americas, and warm and wet in the western part of the Pacific.But when the trade winds die, two things happen: The wind-forced upwelling that draws cool water to the surface slows down, and the warm water that has pooled up in the western part of the Pacific basin starts to slosh back toward the east. And as the warmth spreads eastward, the trade winds—which are partly controlled by the temperature and air pressure differences between the two sides of the Pacific—get even weaker. So there’s a double whammy: the chilly waters that usually help cool down the South American coast stay trapped deep below the surface, and the winds that would help cool things down stagnate.Scientists still don’t know exactly what kicks off the cycle. But they can pick out the signs of a brewing El Niño early and they have a good idea of how the events develop once they’re nudged into action. So once the signs appear, scientists can start warning the general public that an El Niño is likely to pop up about six to nine months later.Some climate models predict that the ENSO cycle will intensify as the planet gets hotter, leading to even warmer, wetter El Niños and drier La Niñas—and more devastating impacts on communities around the world. Others show less intensification, or none at all. Scientists are racing to understand the phenomenon better.It’s also not yet clear whether the cycle has intensified since humans started warming the planet by pumping the atmosphere full of greenhouse gases.What scientists can say is that ENSO has existed for thousands of years and is likely to persist far into the future. And whether or not the actual cycle changes, we’ll likely feel its effects more strongly in the future.",
"The first fin whale appeared in Marmot Bay, where the sea curls a crooked finger around Alaska’s Kodiak Island. A biologist spied the calf drifting on its side, as if at play. Seawater flushed in and out of its open jaws. Spray washed over its slack pink tongue. Death, even the gruesome kind, is usually too familiar to spark alarm in the wild north. But late the next morning, the start of Memorial Day weekend, passengers aboard the ferry Kennicott spotted another whale bobbing nearby. Her blubber was thick. She looked healthy. But she was dead too.Kathi Lefebvre is talking about the whales as we crunch across a windy, rocky beach, 200 miles north of Kodiak. In a typical year eight whales are found dead in the western Gulf of Alaska. But in 2015 at least a dozen popped up in June alone, their bodies so buoyant that gulls used them as fishing platforms. All summer the Pacific Ocean heaved rotting remains into rocky coves along the more than 1,000-mile stretch from Anchorage to the Aleutian Islands. Whole families of brown bears feasted on their carcasses.Lefebvre, a research scientist at NOAA’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington, had examined eye fluid from one of the carcasses in a failed attempt to winnow the cause of death. Now the two of us are on Kachemak Bay in Homer, Alaska, inching toward a wheezing, dying sea otter sprawled out on the shore. Otter deaths are skyrocketing on the shoreline beneath the snowcapped Kenai Mountains, so Lefebvre is here to see whether the fates of these otters and whales are somehow intertwined.In the past few years death had become a bigger part of life in the ocean off North America’s West Coast. Millions of sea stars melted away in tide pools from Santa Barbara, California, to Sitka, Alaska, their bodies dissolving, their arms breaking free and wandering off. Hundreds of thousands of ocean-feeding seabirds tumbled dead onto beaches. Twenty times more sea lions than average starved in California. I watched scientists lift sea otter carcasses onto orange sleds as they perished in Homer—79 turned up dead there in one month. By year’s end, whale deaths in the western Gulf of Alaska would hit a staggering 45. Mass fatalities can be as elemental in nature as wildfire in a lodgepole pine forest, whipping through quickly, killing off the weak and clearing the way for rebirth. But these mysterious casualties all shared one thing: They overlapped with a period when West Coast ocean waters were blowing past modern temperature records.As hotter oceans destroy coral reefs in the tropics and melting ice alters life in the Arctic, it’s been easy to overlook how much warm water can reshape temperate seas. No more. Between 2013 and earlier this year, some West Coast waters grew so astonishingly hot that the marine world experienced unprecedented upheaval. Animals showed up in places they’d never been. A toxic bloom of algae, the biggest of its kind on record, shut down California’s crab industry for months. Key portions of the food web crashed. It’s not clear if greenhouse gas emissions exacerbated this ocean heat wave or if the event simply represented an outer edge of natural weather and climate patterns. But the phenomenon left daunting questions: Was this a quirk, an unlikely confluence of extremes that conspired to make life harsh for some sea creatures? Or was it, as one scientist says, a “dress rehearsal”—a preview, perhaps, of what hotter seas may one day bring as climate change unleashes its fever in the Pacific?While Lefebvre and I are pondering our next move, a radio call comes in. Another dead otter has surfaced on Homer Spit, five miles away. We retrace our steps to a dusty parking lot, pile into a pickup, and head off.Beginning in late 2013, a bewildering patch of warm water formed in the Gulf of Alaska. A stubborn atmospheric high-pressure system, nicknamed the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge,” was keeping storms at bay. Just as blowing across hot coffee frees heat, winds usually churn and cool the sea’s surface. Instead, heat within this shifting mass, which University of Washington climatologist Nick Bond dubbed “the blob,” built up and morphed into a wider patch along North America’s West Coast, where it met warm-water masses creeping north. Sea temperatures in some places rose seven degrees Fahrenheit higher than average. Some patches of ocean were hotter than ever recorded. At its peak the warm water covered about 3.5 million square miles from Mexico to Alaska, an area larger than the contiguous United States.Did planet-warming carbon dioxide from fossil fuels contribute to this event? No one knows for sure. One controversial notion suggests that the rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice is making the polar jet stream wavier, allowing weather systems to persist longer. A more accepted theory pegs this heat to normal atmospheric fluctuations in the jet stream triggered by warmth in the tropics. But even researchers subscribing to that theory don’t necessarily rule out a secondary role for climate change. “Is long-term warming somehow the puppeteer controlling things in the background?” asks Nate Mantua, at NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. “I haven’t seen proof, but it’s clearly a prime suspect.”Unscrambling this weird behavior is difficult because the world’s largest ocean is so confounding to begin with. Overlapping patterns that can last for decades already drive temperature swings. Every few years or decades the eastern Pacific flips from a food-rich, cold-water place to something warmer, a cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. El Niño, the periodic tropical warming, boosts temperatures in North America. An ocean freeway, the California Current, ushers cool water south from Canada to Baja California. Along the way, winds push warm surface waters offshore, causing upwelling, which draws much cooler, nutrient-rich seas from below.All these volatile shifts can redistribute marine life. It just doesn’t usually wind up like this. “When all is said and done, I think people will see this as the most economically and ecologically consequential event in our historical record,” Mantua says of the recent warming.Seeking to understand the magnitude of this episode, I am miles off the Oregon coast, weeks before visiting Alaska. The Elakha, a 54-foot research boat, is cutting through rolling chop beneath a milky sky. Bill Peterson, in jeans and a weathered craft-beer T-shirt, kneels on deck, face pressed into a red cooler. It holds the contents of a net his colleagues just hauled up from the sloshing depths. The NOAA oceanographer is here to show me how thoroughly the eastern Pacific has changed. “Oh my, that’s ugly,” he says. Over his shoulder, I glance down at the bottom of the ocean food web. I see only slop the color of motor oil. That’s his point.Every two weeks for 20 years, Peterson’s team has come here to gather the minuscule plants and animals that form the foundation of one of the planet’s most productive marine systems. The prize course in this buffet is supposed to be inch-long krill. Shaped like shrimps, they are gobbled by auklets, cohos, basking sharks, and whales. Anchovies and sardines eat them and then get wolfed by bigger fish and sea lions. At this time of year, krill should be abundant, but Peterson’s haul reveals mostly soupy algae and small jellyfish, which provide little sustenance. His team hasn’t seen krill in months. “It’s been like this nonstop,” he says.Higher ocean temperatures have thrown this system out of whack. Not long after the warmth arrived, shelled octopuses more common in the South Pacific appeared off Southern California. Tropical sunfish and blue sharks were caught in the North Pacific. Market squid, common off California, laid eggs in southeast Alaska. A few venomous yellow-bellied sea snakes from Central America slithered across beaches near Los Angeles. Peterson’s team caught tropical or subtropical zooplankton he’d never seen: rainbow-hued, beetle-shaped copepods; minuscule iridescent creatures from Hawaii; tiny crustaceans with cobalt egg sacs. He cataloged nearly 20 new species that belonged far away.Compared with krill, these zooplankton were limp-lettuce side salads: smaller and less nutritious. As this low-cal diet coursed through the food web, larval walleye pollock, common in the Gulf of Alaska, reached their lowest numbers in three decades. Halibut caught in Cook Inlet had mushy flesh—a syndrome associated with poor nutrition. Coho salmon returned to West Coast streams as malnourished runts. These changes coincided with other shifts. Sardines, already in decline, decreased so much that an industry made famous by John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row shut down for the first time since rebounding from its collapse in the 1950s. Sardine and anchovy populations are cyclical; their precipitous drop likely had little to do with warm water. But the impact was more pronounced because the unusual heat redistributed the remaining fish. Anchovies, already dwindling, seemed to vanish almost everywhere except Monterey Bay, where they gathered in great numbers, creating a weird feeding frenzy. At one point, 50 or more whales dined in the bay at once. In the Pacific Northwest humpbacks cruised into the Columbia River in search of food. Birds suffered too. At least a hundred thousand blue-footed Cassin’s auklets, small gray-feathered island nesters that eat krill, starved to death. It was one of the biggest die-offs of birds in U.S. history. Then, months later, hundreds of thousands of common murres died too.Perhaps most visible were the skinny, sick sea lion pups that surfed ashore in California, loose fur drooping over bones, looking like children wrapped in parents’ clothes. They collapsed under porches and parked trucks. One curled into a chair on a hotel patio. Another slipped into a booth at a seaside restaurant. Without sardines or anchovies, their mothers ate junk-food diets of squid, hake, and rockfish, and weaned pups early. More than 3,000 were stranded in five months.Chugging back to his office in Newport, Oregon, Peterson is baffled. After a lifetime studying the sea, he finds this warm ocean unfamiliar and disorienting, “like looking out the window and seeing a macaw fly by.”It's not that the blob is the new normal. It isn’t. Few if any of these changes are permanent. Even if they were, it wouldn’t mean the sea was dying. Ocean life will continue. But the blob offers something of an analogue for future seas under climate change. And marine life in this sea of tomorrow will look very different.Warmer temperatures speed fish metabolisms, requiring them to eat more, just as their food declines. Some fish may see tinier bodies, more disease, and, in many cases, falling populations, according to recent studies. Already, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, many fish and plankton are heading toward the poles in search of cooler temperatures. As productive areas grow scarcer with less cold water, fish and predators will congregate in fewer places, creating new challenges. During the recent heat wave, more West Coast whales appeared to get tangled in fishing gear or debris. From 2000 to 2012, rescue crews fielded about 10 reports a year. Forty-eight were confirmed in 2015.And when creatures show up somewhere new, our relationship with the sea can shift too. In Pacifica, California, I visit Richard Shafer, a lanky 58-year-old electrician who free-dives for fish with a speargun. As the heat wave drove game fish north from Mexico, fishing charters off Los Angeles had their best season in memory. So in August 2015, Shafer took a charter to an offshore bank west of San Diego. He speared a yellowtail, and then a hungry sea lion darted past. Knowing that sea lions steal big fish, especially in the absence of sardines, Shafer pulled his yellowtail close and swam toward the boat, only to be bitten on the wrist by a seven-foot smooth hammerhead. These sharks are rarely seen in California, and rarely attack, yet there were several encounters in 2015 during what one scientist called “an endless parade of hammerheads” lured by warm water. The animal severed Shafer’s tendon and fractured a pinkie and knuckle, requiring 40 stitches. Each change in the sea can trigger another that no one sees coming.The sky pinks with the dying day as Kathi Lefebvre hops from a pickup truck onto a pebbly stretch of Homer Spit and stares down at the dead otter. Sea wash muddies the pale fur of its face. Otters in previous years mostly died from complications of a streptococcal infection. This year some of the dead look emaciated, while others look almost fit. Interns with the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge don blue latex gloves and begin an examination. One intern is moved nearly to tears. Another tells Lefebvre about an otter she’d seen shuddering in spasms the week before. Lefebvre perks up.“The thing you’re describing, the tremors in the whole body?” Lefebvre says. “I’ve seen that. In sea lions.”In 1998, as a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Lefebvre learned that dozens of sea lions were turning up sick and twitchy. Lefebvre had a hunch why: Each spring, a single-celled toxic alga called Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in small patches, usually for a week, maybe two, producing a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which accumulates in shellfish. When ingested by people, this toxin can cause seizures, memory loss, even death. It also can harm wildlife. In 1961, a Santa Cruz newspaper told of a mysterious invasion of sooty shearwaters “fresh from a feast of anchovies.” The seabirds bashed into windows and died on streets. Alfred Hitchcock used the incident as part of his inspiration for The Birds. Scientists tracking the mystery decades later unearthed old samples of plankton pulled from Monterey Bay in 1961. They detected high levels of Pseudo-nitzschia.When Lefebvre found domoic acid in the feces of sick sea lions in 1998, it was the first evidence that this type of toxic bloom could hurt marine mammals. And blooms that year were particularly bad. El Niño had brought withering ocean heat to California, igniting the most ferocious bloom on record—until last year.In April 2015 algae bloomed, but instead of dissipating after a few weeks, the bloom grew into a monster, morphing and shifting, stretching over 2,000 miles, from California’s Channel Islands to Kodiak. No one had seen anything like it. Some shellfish harvests closed along the coast. Toxin concentrations were 30 times greater than what would normally be considered high. Tests found domoic acid in some fish, such as anchovies, at amounts too dangerous for people to eat, a rarity. The toxin appeared to sicken hundreds of sea lions, seabirds, porpoises, and seals. Video from Washington State showed a sea lion suffering a toxin-induced seizure, something never seen that far north. Blooms dragged into November.Then there were Alaska’s dead whales, primarily fins and humpbacks. Most were too remote or too far gone to test. A few that washed up in British Columbia showed traces of domoic acid, but the toxin flushes so quickly it’s impossible to know if the dose was large or small. Scientists lacked proof, but most shared a theory: Whales ate krill, copepods, or fish dosed by algal toxins, which killed them outright or scrambled their brains, hampering navigation and feeding. “Given that we’ve ruled out most other scenarios, what is most prominent in my mind is toxic algae,” says Andrew Trites, director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the University of British Columbia.Standing on Homer Spit, Lefebvre wonders aloud if algae played a role in killing Alaska’s otters. She sets down plastic bags to collect specimens and pulls on gloves. Leaning over the stiffening otter, she bends to her work.True to its B-movie name, the blob began fading in December 2015, its heat sinking deep into the sea with the arrival of a powerful El Niño. But divining what this heat portends will take years. New research suggests that heat waves like the blob may become more common and intense because of climate change. Scientists foresee “higher extremes, more unusual events. It gets more chaotic,” says Raphael Kudela, an ocean sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Scientists project that toxic blooms will be more frequent, more widespread, and more toxic.That could spell trouble for people too. I meet Dick Ogg in his paint-splattered khakis, strolling down a wooden ramp at Bodega Bay’s Spud Point Marina. He’s rebuilding a hold on the Karen Jeanne. The commercial fisherman chases salmon, albacore, and sablefish but makes his real money gathering Dungeness crab. Yet his boat hasn’t moved much in months. Crab remained unsafe to eat long after toxic blooms vanished, so California delayed its crab harvest for months, at a loss of $48 million. The governor sought disaster relief from the U.S. government. Out-of-work deckhands lived off gift cards and a marina food bank. The closest Ogg came to fishing was helping regulators catch crab to test for toxins. “A lot of folks are really hurting,” Ogg says glumly.Yet not all of what the blob produced is a harbinger of something. Given warming over decades, rather than the blob’s span of roughly two years, plants and animals may adapt or move. Some die-offs might have happened without the blob. Sea star deaths, while hastened by the warm water, were actually caused by a virus that hit well before the blob. California sea lion populations may simply have grown too large.And more changes are coming. Rising seas are reshaping coastlines. Natural low-oxygen zones in deep waters are expanding. Ocean acidification is making life harder for shellfish. Predicting the future is messy—especially when we barely understand the present.Lefebvre never solved the otter mystery. By year’s end, 304 were dead—nearly five times the recent average. One-third of the carcasses that scientists tested were positive for toxic algae. But strep infection was diagnosed as the primary cause of death for most otters. Any role that the blob played in exacerbating the infection remains a riddle. Did algal toxins weaken the animals? Did warm water somehow make things worse? “We still don’t know how all these tweaks in our world come together,” Lefebvre says.Weeks later, I have a similar chat with Julia Parrish, a bird expert at the University of Washington, who has been tracking the murres’ deaths. She doesn’t know if the seabirds chased scarce food to strange places, got mixed up by domoic acid, or were pushed ashore by winds. “I am still just mystified,” she tells me.And that, more than anything, I now realize, may be our new normal: the unfathomable gulf between the sea we thought we knew and the one we’re rapidly creating.",

"Earth’s oceans are warmer now than at any point since humans started systematically tracking their temperatures, according to research published on January 16 in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. The oceans have sopped up more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by human-emitted greenhouse gases, slowing the warming of the atmosphere—but causing many other unwelcome changes to the planet’s climate.Even a slightly warmer ocean can have dramatic impacts. Other new research shows that warmer oceans make waves stronger. Warmer waters fuel stronger storms, increasing the damage that hurricanes and tropical storms inflict. The added warmth hurts coral habitats and stresses fisheries. Around Antarctica, yet another new study suggests, ice is melting about six times faster than it was in the 1980s—an increase due in part to the warmer waters lapping at the continent’s edge.“The oceans are the best thermometer we have for the planet,” says Zeke Hausfather, an energy and climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who used the ocean heat data published today in an analysis published last week in Science. “We can really see global warming loud and clear in the ocean record.”As early as the 1800s, scientists suspected that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would cause air temperatures around the planet to rise. By the 1960s, once they started keeping careful track of both air temperatures and carbon dioxide levels around the world, their predictions were borne out.The atmosphere didn’t seem to be warming quite as much as model calculations indicated it should, however. Where could the extra heat be going?Some oceanographers suspected that the “missing” heat was being absorbed into the oceans—but measuring that heat was much harder than measuring air temperatures. Although research ships crossing the ocean would occasionally dip a probe into the water to test the temperature, those data were tiny blips in the wide expanse of the sea.So scientists pulled together all data they could find, from observations from commercial ships to naval data to historical records. And when all that was compiled, the scientists realized that the oceans were, in fact, acting as an enormous buffer for the climate system, like a giant pillow softening the hard landing of climate change.In the last decade, measurements of the ocean's heat content have been improved dramatically by a new tool: Some 3,000 autonomous sensors, called Argo floats, have been scattered around the ocean. They regularly record temperatures in the top 6,500 feet of the water column and have immensely improved the quality of the data scientists have to work with for these estimates.Thanks to those measurements, it's now clear that the oceans are absorbing some 90 percent of the heat our carbon emissions have trapped in the atmosphere—the most recent estimate, published last week, pegs that number at 93 percent. If all the heat the ocean absorbed from 1955 onward were suddenly added to the atmosphere, air temperatures would rocket by more than 60 degrees.In other words, the oceans are acting as a giant thermal buffer, protecting us from feeling all the heat of climate change directly. But the heat isn't going away.In 2018, the entire top slice of the ocean, from the surface down 6,500 feet, was warmer than ever before, just over one tenth of a degree Celsius warmer overall than the long-term average. Even that tiny bump was enough to nudge sea levels about an eight of an inch higher, simply because warmer water takes up more space.But 2018 caps off nearly three decades of smooth, consistent warming, the cumulative results of which can be felt more keenly.“The warming seems small on a day-to-day basis, but it adds up over time,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and an author of today’s report. The extra energy pooling in the atmosphere slowly percolates into the ocean, and “and that’s why we keep breaking records year after year,” he says.More alarmingly, over those last few decades, oceans warmed nearly 40 percent faster than they did in the middle of the last century, say the authors of the Science analysis from last week.Since the Industrial Revolution, says Laure Zanna, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who recently inventoried the ocean's growing absorption of extra heat, the amount of extra energy trapped in the ocean as a result of our greenhouse gas emissions is about 1,000 times as great as the amount of the energy humans use each year, worldwide.There’s essentially no limit to how much more heat from the atmosphere the oceans can absorb: they’re huge and deep. But the ocean has a long memory, and the heat it sucks up now will be stuck in the system for hundreds or even thousands of years: The ghost of a cold phase from a few hundred years ago in the North Atlantic is still floating through the world’s oceans, a study published in Science in early January showed.So the decisions we make now will affect us far into the future, says Susan Wijffels, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod. “The ability of the deep ocean to take up heat on that very long timescale is great. But it's also locking in a commitment in the system,” she says. So even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases tomorrow, the ocean will continue to warm for centuries—and will take even longer to shed the extra heat.The effects, say the authors of the new heat assessment, are likely to disrupt both marine physics and marine life. Warmer oceans hold less oxygen, which could hurt biota from plankton to whales. A warmer baseline temperature makes the likelihood of marine heat waves more likely, like the one that swept through the waters off northeast China last summer, ruining the sea cucumber harvest across the shallow seas. Zanna and her colleagues also see evidence that the major currents that carry heat and nutrients around the ocean are changing.The full magnitude of the changes will take hundreds of years to play out, Wijffels says.“Every molecule of CO2 that we don’t put into the atmosphere now is saving us from warming potential in the future,” she says. “This really drives home that we need to reduce emissions now, as much as we can.”",
"The U.S. isn’t a major producer or consumer of shark fins, but its location along trade routes means that it serves as a transport hub for them.A cargo plane bound for Asia stopped at Miami International Airport for a few hours to refuel on January 24. In its belly was a consignment of 18 large cardboard boxes that, unbeknownst to the wildlife inspectors on duty, contained something highly protected and—in some cases—illegal: shark fins.“The inspectors were just like, ‘Well, let’s see if there’s anything else in it that is not supposed to be there,’” says Eva Lara, a supervisory inspector with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which regulates wildlife imports and exports.The first few boxes Fish and Wildlife Service and Customs and Border Protection inspectors opened held legal wildlife products. But as they dug deeper into the contents, they uncovered shark fins. “Then it became box after box after box of just shark fin,” Lara says. Most held upwards of 60 pounds of shark fins—1,400 pounds in all. She says it was one of the largest in-transit shark fin seizures ever made.Initially, Lara says, they estimated that more than a quarter of the 4,000 fins (representing at least a thousand sharks) were from protected species and therefore illegal. But after weeks of sorting, measuring, and identifying, they concluded that as much as 40 percent were illegal—among them species such as the great hammerhead shark, the silky shark, and the thresher shark. The commercial value of the shipment was roughly a million dollars.So as not to jeopardize their case or encourage copycats, the Fish and Wildlife Service did not disclose the shipment’s country of origin, destination, what it was labeled as, and what else it contained.The U.S. isn’t a significant producer or consumer of shark parts, but as a facilitator in the global shark fin market, it’s a transportation “powerhouse,” says David Jacoby, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London. “The fins, whether legally or illegally obtained, have a fast route to their ultimate destination, which is often far East Asia,” he says. Americans “have some of the largest airports in the world, that have some of the highest numbers of flights and carriers, that enable things to move very quickly from one place to another.” (Read more about the U.S.'s role in the shark fin trade.)Sharks have been around for more than 400 million years, but today an estimated one-quarter of sharks, rays, and chimaeras (cartilaginous fish) are threatened with extinction. Some shark populations have declined by as much as 90 percent, largely as a result of overfishing. Because sharks mature slowly and have few offspring, it takes time for populations to rebound: Greenland sharks, which are thought to be able to live up to 500 years, likely don’t even start breeding until the age of 156.The fish are coveted for their fins, used in shark fin soup, a traditional Asian dish that Lara says can sell for up to $600 a bowl. Their meat, however, has little value, which means that some fishermen engage in finning—slicing the fins off live sharks and tossing the wounded animals overboard, where they sink to the bottom and drown, die of blood loss, or get eaten by other predators. This practice has been illegal in U.S. waters since 2000; various countries and international agreements also restrict shark finning.In the context of the illegal shark fin trade, says Arthur Florence Jr., branch chief of Agriculture Air Cargo Operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Miami airport haul was a “drop in the bucket.” From 2000 to 2011, countries legally imported an average of nearly 17,000 tons of shark fins a year, according to conservative estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Each year, scientists estimate, tens of millions of sharks are killed in both the legal and illegal shark fin trade—a troubling number, given “the lower productivity of … species common in the fin trade,” according to a 2006 study estimating the scale of shark catches worldwide.In the United States, 13 states and three territories have banned the sale of shark fins. But the country’s location along trafficking trade routes—between shark fishing countries in South and Central America and shark fin markets in Asia—means that significant illegal shipments transit the U.S. by land, air, and sea, according to a 2019 report on the U.S.’s role in the shark fin trade by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a conservation nonprofit.The NRDC report says that during the seven years from 2010 to 2017, between 591 and 859 metric tons of shark fins—from some 900,000 sharks—passed through U.S. ports. Yet those numbers are likely conservative estimates. That’s because the researchers focused only on Hong Kong as a destination, based their numbers on a single global shipping database, and tallied shipping records that explicitly declared the cargo to be shark fins. It’s common for shark fin to be incorrectly labeled as “frozen seafood” or “dried seafood”—or even as something completely unrelated like “tennis shoes,” if it’s “full-on smuggling,” says Elizabeth Murdock, director of the Pacific Ocean Initiative for the NRDC and lead author of the report.The U.S. is obligated by both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the treaty aimed at ensuring that cross-border trade doesn’t threaten species’ survival, and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations to monitor in-transit wildlife shipments. Shark fins that are imported and then re-exported must be processed and may need CITES and U.S. permits. Shipments that simply pass through ports should be monitored but often aren’t, Murdock says, adding that if cargo transferred from one plane or ship to another stays under the control of the same shipping company, it likely won’t be inspected.According to Florence, the inspection in Miami airport was a combination of intel and luck. The Fish and Wildlife Service had tipped customs off that a shark fin shipment was coming, but since the Agriculture Air Cargo Operations department processes more than a hundred in-transit flights daily at Miami airport, catching every illegal shark fin simply isn’t possible. “It’s kind of like finding that needle in the haystack.”Michelle Zetwo, special agent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says she knew there must be occasions when shark fins transited through U.S. ports, but she was surprised at the numbers reported by the NRDC.In 2017, Zetwo was part of a shark fin bust at the Port of Oakland. The shipment of more than 52,000 pounds of shark fins, labeled as cucumbers and gherkins, was discovered during a routine inspection of a container vessel traveling from Panama to Hong Kong.As with the 2020 Miami seizure, the discovery largely came down to luck, Zetwo says. “We didn’t know until we did the inspection, and it was just happenstance.”Between 591 and 859 metric tons of shark fins passed through U.S. ports from 2010 to 2017, according to a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The report’s lead author says that's likely just the “tip of the iceberg.”The NRDC report also notes that many exporting countries in Latin America are “major players” in the international shark fin trade and that nations such as Panama and Costa Rica ship as much as one-third to half of their shark fin exports through the U.S.It’s all but certain that some of these fins are from protected species, Murdock says. Top exporting countries—such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru—fish for species commonly found in the shark fin trade, and many of those are banned from trade without permits, according to a 2018 study.“We’re pretty sure we just found the tip of the iceberg,” Murdock says of the NRDC’s findings. “Just how big the iceberg is hard to know.”If the U.S. wants to actually serve as the shark stronghold it’s widely considered to be, it has a responsibility to act as a “backstop” and catch more of the illegal shark fins, Murdock says. “When we let these shark fin shipments pass through our borders without monitoring them, we’re becoming a weak link in that chain, where we instead should be one of the strongest links in that global supply chain because we have the strong legal framework and the resources to combat that trade.”The Fish and Wildlife Service’s Eva Lara agrees. “You have to say, ‘Not on my watch, not here,’” she says. “If shark fins are coming through the United States, then we have to be an advocate and enforce other countries’ regulations and help the animals survive.”“I don’t think any of the wildlife agencies want illegal shark fins to enter U.S. commerce,” Michelle Zetwo says. “But having the resources available and the knowledge of when they might be coming through our ports—it’s important, and we don’t always have that information in a timely fashion.”Because trade is so difficult to monitor, the best way to address the U.S.’s unintentional role in the global shark fin trade is a blanket ban, Jacoby says.It now takes shark fins about four flights to reach Hong Kong from Latin America, Jacoby found in an analysis of airline trade networks. He determined that a U.S. shark fin ban would slightly increase the necessary number of flights and raise the overall cost of transporting fins.“If you don’t go via these big hubs, it becomes more expensive to get from A to B,” he says. “I think as that burden becomes more and more, the incentive to actually fish and ship in the first place, hopefully, will start to come down a little bit.”After the Miami discovery in January, it was a bittersweet moment to see all the shark fins laid out, says Arthur Florence, of Agriculture Air Cargo Operations—sweet that they caught the illegal fins, bitter to think of the dead sharks. “It was a ton of juvenile fins that were actually cut off,” he says wistfully. “Some of those sharks take about 20 years to reproduce.”That’s why it’s urgent to act now because sharks “don’t bounce back quickly,” Jacoby says. “We can only drag our heels for so much longer, before we don’t have a problem because there aren’t any sharks anymore.”",
"The shortfin mako shark, considered vulnerable as its numbers have fallen, is one of the species found in shark fin soup samples collected from around the United States.If you’re in Los Angeles and the mood strikes, you can order shark fin soup from China Gate Restaurant for home delivery for $16.95.But that would be against state law. California is one of 12 states that bans the sale of shark fins—measures to help prevent further declines of shark populations and to deter finning, which has been illegal in U.S. waters since 2000. Although demand for shark fins for soup is greatest in Asian countries, there’s significant demand for them in the United States too.A man who identified himself as the China Gate Restaurant owner’s brother says the online listing is a mistake and denies that the restaurant serves the dish.Finning involves slicing fins off live sharks and tossing the wounded animals overboard, where they sink to the bottom and, unable to swim and pass water over their gills, suffocate, die of blood loss, or get eaten by other predators.“It’s without doubt, the worst act of animal cruelty I’ve ever seen,” says celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay in his television documentary on the shark fishing industry.Every year, the Animal Welfare Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that supports a national ban on shark fin, updates its list of restaurants that serve shark fin soup and notifies the relevant state enforcement agencies.But so far, according to the institute, the bans haven’t stopped restaurants in at least 10 of the 12 states.These shark fins were photographed in a market in Chinatown, San Francisco, in February 2011. California introduced a shark fin ban in 2013.During the past two years, at least five bills relating to the country’s shark fin trade have been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. All five died before becoming laws, leaving the fate of sharks in the U.S. uncertain.Many countries don’t regulate shark finning, says Peter Knights, CEO of WildAid, an environmental group that strives to reduce consumption of wildlife products. What this means, activists say, is that Americans could be getting their fins from countries that catch and mutilate sharks, diminishing their already dwindling global populations.Because of overfishing and the demand for shark fin for soup, more than a quarter of the world’s sharks, rays, and chimaeras (a cartilaginous fish also known as ghost sharks) are considered to be threatened. In a 2012 study, researchers found the DNA of eight different sharks, including the endangered scalloped hammerhead, as well as vulnerable species like the shortfin mako and the spiny dogfish, in soup samples collected from around the U.S.Shark fin soup has long been a status dish in Asian countries, notably China, where its use can be traced back to an emperor from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) who is thought to have invented the dish to show off his power and wealth. Shark fin eventually became exalted as one of the four treasures of Chinese cuisine, along with abalone, sea cucumber, and fish maw (swim bladders).Today, it’s a luxury dish served at weddings as a sign of respect for guests. Preparation of the soup involves boiling the fins and scraping off the skin and meat, leaving behind softened protein fiber, which is sometimes shredded before it goes into the soup.What is a luxury to some is a headache to understaffed enforcement agencies in the U.S. states that ban shark fin. They say that cases against shark fin vendors in those states can be hard to make. Because the shark fin trade tends to go underground, it has been compared to the illicit drug trade.“I know it’s going on, I know it’s out there,” says San Francisco marine warden William O'Brien. “But it’s a very private matter—it’s not the kind of thing that, you know, people are selling to the public.”In addition, according to several law enforcement agents, fines and jail sentences for violating the shark fin ban are generally light and have little deterrent effect.Knights says a U.S. ban on sales of shark fin would be a significant step forward because it would send the message that selling and consuming shark fin isn’t acceptable anymore. The sale of shark fin, he says, “continues to increase the sort of pressure on sharks worldwide.”But, argues Robert Hueter, director of the Center for Shark Research at Mote Marine Laboratory, in Sarasota, Florida, given how difficult it is for some states to enforce their shark fin bans, a nationwide ban would just drive the shark fin market underground—as it’s done in San Francisco.Preparing shark fin soup involves boiling the fin and scraping off the skin and meat, leaving behind softened protein fiber, by then unrecognizable as a fin.California has about a third of the country’s Asian population and is one of the largest consumers of shark fin outside Asia.When the shark fin ban passed in California in 2011, San Francisco marine warden William O'Brien says he was “charged up.” He’d been keeping a list of restaurants to inspect once the ban went into force.Almost immediately, he and his team received a tip about a supplier, and they confiscated more than 2,000 pounds of shark fin from a warehouse near San Francisco Bay. He estimates that the haul was worth at least $500,000. The accused, Michael Kwong, a shark fin wholesaler and vocal opponent of the shark fin ban who said his family had been in the business for four generations, pleaded no contest to violating the shark fin ban. According to court records, he spent 30 days in jail, paid a court fine, and received three years’ probation.Since then, O’Brien says, the leads have dried up. He suspects restaurants and market owners are now storing their shark fin supplies off premises—perhaps in their homes, which would be off-limits to law enforcement without a search warrant.“Essentially, the market has gone so far underground that it requires more specialization than I have to dig it up,” O’Brien says.O’Brien’s overall responsibilities include monitoring for illegal ivory, the pet trade, and illegal animal products in medication, and he must also check hunting and fishing licenses almost daily. He reckons that in any given month, he’s able to devote only about two days to shark fin.“It would be great if I was like, the shark fin guy, and that was all I did,” O’Brien laments.A complicating factor is that a restauranteur accused of selling shark fin soup may claim it’s imitation or made from a species of shark exempt from the ban. Spiny and smooth dogfish sharks, for example, are exempt in New York State. It’s possible to identify a species from a freshly cut fin, but once a fin is dried or absorbed in soup, the only way to prove it’s a species in violation of the law is through DNA testing.To ascertain whether a crime has been committed, authorities must establish whether the DNA in a seized sample of soup is actually that of a shark. The specimens Ashley Spicer tests and analyzes as a part of her work in the Wildlife Forensics Lab at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife vary from suspected shark fin soup in plastic to-go containers to frozen fins in vacuum-sealed packaging.Spicer examined California’s 2018 shark cases—all four of them. Only two of those cases were specifically shark fin; the others were a shark attack case and a poaching case. In all, the two shark fin cases she handled in 2018 involved about 20 different shark fins.Low test numbers don’t necessarily represent every California shark fin case that comes to the attention of authorities. If, for example, a case elicits an immediate confession on the part of the accused, authorities may decide that testing isn’t necessary.DNA testing proved successful in a recent case in Plano, Texas, one of the states where shark fin is banned. Mike Stephens, a game warden with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, went into a local dim sum restaurant—in uniform—with a colleague and asked for the “special” menu. And there it was: shark fin soup.These shark fins were seized by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.To assure them the shark fin was real, not imitation, the restaurant owner’s wife led the wardens to a walk-in freezer where they found about six bags of shark fins. Stephens assumes that the owner, Qi Zhou, and his wife didn’t realize the real reason behind the wardens’ visit until it was too late. Before they left, Stephens says, Zhou’s wife told them they weren’t the only ones selling shark fin. The supermarket next door was offering it too, she said.Sure enough, when the wardens went to the supermarket, Tao Marketplace, to investigate, they found nearly 40 shark carcasses, the tail fins removed, on display in the fresh fish aisle and in storage.Wearing rubber gloves so as not to contaminate the evidence, they sealed the fins from both places in separate containers and overnighted them to a lab in North Carolina for DNA testing.The case against the supermarket is still pending, but the restaurant owner was found guilty of selling shark fin and paid a fine: one dollar. The court also ordered Zhou to make a donation to the Animal Welfare Institute, which totaled less than a thousand dollars, Stephens says.According to the institute, in Texas and most other states, prison sentences for shark fin transgressions are rare and usually don’t exceed six months for a first offense. Fines are usually less than a thousand dollars. By contrast, a single pound of dried shark fin can sell for $400, and shark fin soup can command anywhere from $50 to $200.“It’s tough to get jail time on wildlife cases,” says Jesse Paluch, a captain with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s Bureau of Environmental Crimes Investigation unit. In New York, he says, judges and prosecutors “see so much crime, so wildlife crime is a little bit lower on the spectrum.”In October 1988, when Robert Hueter was getting his start at the Mote Marine Laboratory, he heard from a colleague that a group of fishermen off the Florida Panhandle had been caught harpooning bottlenose dolphins, whose meat and blood they used to bait sharks. Killing bottlenose dolphins was and still is illegal under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. When the fishermen caught sharks, they sliced off their fins and threw the mutilated animals, still alive, back into the water.This is sick, Hueter says he thought at the time. He’d never heard of shark finning, so he contacted Nelson Bryant, a reporter he knew at The New York Times, who wrote a pioneering story about the practice. Today, shark finning is the subject of documentaries, public protests, and Facebook posts.Hueter says the fishermen were handed minor fines for killing the dolphins—and no penalty for finning the sharks. “There was no crime in what they’d done with the sharks,” he says.Since then, Hueter has been an advocate for sharks. Which is why, he says, he’s against a national shark fin ban.“The folks that are pushing the fin ban campaign want to simplify it to this very simple message—that if we ban the fin trade in the United States, we save sharks all around the world,” Heuter says. “That is so simplistic and so wrong.”Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay calls shark finning “the worst act of animal cruelty I’ve ever seen.”He says that of course he’s against finning and overfishing but that cutting the fins off a legally caught dead shark isn’t cruel, and banning a specific dish won’t stop shark finning because shark finning is already illegal in U.S. waters. But, he says, a ban will ensure that fins from dead sharks are wasted.“It would cause [fishermen] to have to throw the fins into the dumpster. It goes totally against our doctrine of full utilization of fishery products—that when we harvest fishes from the sea, we don’t want to throw stuff away. We want to use absolutely everything we can.”David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist with Simon Fraser University, in Vancouver, Canada, and the man behind the popular Twitter account @whysharksmatter, says it’s unreasonable for people to criticize using shark fins for soup when they may eat shark meat in other forms.“There are people who are outraged at the idea of consuming a bowl of shark fin soup who are not outraged at the idea of eating a mako shark steak on the grill,” he says. “From my perspective, as a shark conservation biologist, either way you’ve got a dead shark. Shark fin soup has sort of become this boogie man of ocean conservation.”As an alternative to a national ban, in 2018 Hueter helped draft the Sustainable Shark Fisheries and Trade Act, which Representative Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican, says he plans to reintroduce this session. This bill, Hueter says, would allow imports only from countries that prohibit finning and promote shark conservation.But Susan Millward, director of the marine animal program at the Animal Welfare Institute, says a blanket ban is still the best answer.“Even if you have a sustainable shark fin trade, there’s still going to be a trade in shark finning,” she says. “There’s always going to be people who want to flout it.”Chinese basketball star Yao Ming pushes a white ceramic cup of shark fin soup across a table. In an aquarium tank to his right, a bleeding computer-generated shark sinks to the bottom. “Remember,” he says, staring into the camera lens, “when the buying stops, the killing can too.”Santa Catalina Island, CaliforniaSince 2011, consumption of shark fin soup in China has fallen by about 80 percent, both because of national bans on serving shark fin at government banquets and the effect of celebrity-backed awareness campaigns such as Yao Ming’s, seen by millions of Chinese.According to a 2018 WildAid report, when WildAid began its Chinese anti-shark fin campaign in 2006, 75 percent of consumers didn’t realize the soup they were eating was made from shark, and many who did know mistakenly thought that sharks’ fins grew back after they were cut off.Many conservationists believe that similar awareness-raising efforts in the U.S. would curb demand. People generally don’t give much thought to what they’re eating, Millward says. “It’s just a lack of connecting the dots with where this product came from, how it started with a live animal and how much suffering was endured to reach this finished product … These animals are dying painfully, and their whole ecosystems are being affected—for what?”Her question begs another: Why shark fin? It’s widely known that the fin adds no taste or health benefits to shark fin soup; rather, it gives the soup a crystalline, noodle-like texture, which can be replicated almost indistinguishably with mung bean paste or melon. What’s more, because shark fins are cartilage and rigid protein fibers, they need to be cooked for hours, even a full day, to soften them enough to be edible. “If you cook my belt for 24 hours, it would be edible too,” Knights says.Ironically, as conservationists, chefs, and even consumers themselves acknowledge, the flavor of shark fin soup—a dish that has ignited international controversy, spurred people to write countless letters to the United States Congress, and led to a massive awareness campaign—comes not from the fins but from the chicken broth used as the soup’s base.",
"This 1620 version of The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine, first compiled some 2,100 years ago, includes a map of qi lines and acupuncture points. Acupuncture remains a contentious subject among Western doctors, though many agree it’s effective at treating some symptoms.In my hand I’m holding a warm, beating heart. About the size of a softball, it’s a luminous globe of scarlet, pink, and white tissue.I can feel its chambers contracting and hear the whoosh of the fluid it’s still pumping. It’s slimy and gives off a slightly pungent odor.The organ is alive almost eight hours after I watched Paul Iaizzo remove it from a sedated pig in a basement lab, connect it to tubes simulating arteries and veins, and spark it back into rhythm with an electric jolt, as a paramedic would shock a human heart back to life. Although it’s outside the pig’s body, the heart flexes and lurches on its own, driven by some unseen, unexplained, primordial force. More than grotesque, I find it hypnotic and beautiful.The pig’s heart is still beating partly because Iaizzo, a professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota, treated it with a bath of chemicals mimicking those in bile from bears. It’s a scientific application of a belief Chinese healers espoused as far back as the eighth century: Bear bile can benefit the human body.A robust market for bear bile still exists. In Asia bears are farmed for their bile, kept alive in small cages, with catheters inserted to drain their fluids. Animal welfare groups decry the practice, which is inarguably inhumane. And yet, as I hold the beating pig heart and listen to Iaizzo describe how the chemicals that protect a bear’s organs from atrophying during hibernation could also sustain human organs, I can’t help but wonder whether bear bile could have saved my father’s failing heart, or whether someday it might save mine, or my children’s.Few subjects ignite more heated debate in health circles than traditional Chinese medicine. It’s further complicated by the work of researchers like Iaizzo and many others who are looking at traditional cures through the lens of cutting-edge science and finding some interesting surprises—surprises that could have profound impacts on modern medicine. Cultures from the Arctic to the Amazon and Siberia to the South Pacific have developed their own medicine chests of traditional cures. But China, with one of the oldest continuous accumulations of documented medical observations, offers the biggest trove for scientists to sift through.The Chinese record dates back to the third century B.C., when healers began analyzing the body, interpreting its functions, and describing its reactions to various treatments, including herbal remedies, massage, and acupuncture. For more than 2,200 years, generations of scholars added to and refined the knowledge. The result is a canon of literature dealing with every sort of health problem, including the common cold, venereal disease, paralysis, and epilepsy. This knowledge is contained in books and manuscripts bearing such enigmatic titles as The Pulse Classic (third century), Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Pieces of Gold (seventh century), and Essential Secrets From Outside the Metropolis (eighth century).After a weightlifting workout, Harrison received a Chinese cupping treatment, in which a therapist uses suction to attach plastic cups to the skin. In recent years many athletes and trainers have embraced the therapy as a way to reduce inflammation, increase blood flow, and perform a type of deep tissue massage.Traditional medicine remained the primary form of health care in China until the early 20th century, when the last Qing emperor was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen, a Western-trained doctor who promoted science-based medicine. Today Chinese physicians are trained and licensed according to state-of-the-art medical practices. Yet traditional medicine remains a vibrant part of the state health care system. Most Chinese hospitals have a ward devoted to ancient cures. Citing traditional medicine’s potential to lower costs and yield innovative treatments, not to mention raise China’s prestige, President Xi Jinping has made it a key part of the country’s health policy. He has called the 21st century a new golden age for traditional medicine.From a research perspective, it very well may be a golden age. Scientists from leading universities in the United States and Europe, including UCLA, Duke, and Oxford, as well as many in Asia, are looking at the scientific underpinnings of some traditional treatments for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson’s.But the practice of melding the modern with the traditional is also spreading among health care consumers. When they don’t find relief from Western medicine, Americans increasingly are turning to traditional treatments, notably acupuncture, which is now covered by some health insurance plans, and cupping, a muscle therapy that involves suction and is endorsed by many professional athletes. The internet has fostered the growth in herbal remedies, which are often cheaper than doctor-prescribed pharmaceuticals. A patient can read about a traditional remedy online, order the herbs on Amazon, and watch YouTube videos on how to prepare them at home. The result is a growing alternative health sector, which in 2017 saw U.S. herbal supplement sales top eight billion dollars, a 68 percent increase since 2008.You’ll also find doctors who denounce traditional Chinese medicine as pseudoscience and quackery, pointing to some of its most outlandish claims, like the ancient practice of prescribing firecrackers to chase away demons, or mysterious concepts still embraced, such as a nebulous life force called qi (a term translated literally as “the steam that rises from the rice”). Others rail against its use of animal parts and warn against the potential dangers of its herbal formulas.“Rarely do you find anyone who looks at it objectively,” says medical historian Paul Unschuld. A leading authority on the history of Chinese medicine—and often an unsparing critic of the way it’s interpreted—he has collected and translated hundreds of ancient medical texts and is working with a Chinese-German startup to study them for ideas about treating a variety of illnesses, including epilepsy. “People generally see only what they want to see,” he says, “and fail to fully examine its merits and its faults.”I encountered this hornet’s nest firsthand when I wrote a story about rhinos being poached for their horns. According to ancient Chinese formulas, rhino horn can be used to treat fever and headaches. In Vietnam I found patients using it to treat hangovers and the side effects of chemotherapy. Multiple scientific studies have determined that rhino horn, which is made of keratin (the same substance as human fingernails), induces little to no discernible pharmacological effects when ingested. But some patients using rhino horn may find relief because of the placebo effect. After the story was published, I got letters from readers angrily denouncing Chinese medicine as “ignorant,” “cruel,” and akin to “witchcraft.”Such criticisms aren’t without merit. Rhino horn sales in Asia are a primary factor pushing rhino populations toward extinction. In addition to bears, many other animals—including several threatened species such as tigers, leopards, and elephants—are poached in the wild or farmed for their parts.But modern medicine has its own controversial practices. The effectiveness of many popular antidepressant drugs remains hotly debated, with some studies showing they are barely more effective than placebos. Yet these drugs are extensively marketed and widely prescribed by physicians, generating billions of dollars in revenue. (This isn’t to say depression drugs don’t work. If a patient’s symptoms are relieved, then one can argue they work. But the chemicals in the pills themselves may not always be the source of the relief, just like the chemicals in rhino horn aren’t necessarily the source of relief for patients who take it.) When considered alongside other notable examples—the overprescription of opioids, doctor-endorsed fad diets, and questionable surgeries—Western indignation over traditional Chinese medicine can seem more hypocritical than Hippocratic.This is where snake oil might offer some illumination. Long synonymous with swindling, snake oil actually refers to a traditional Chinese ointment derived from the fat of the Erabu sea snake. Historians believe that such ointments were introduced to the U.S. during the 1800s by Chinese immigrants building railroads, who used them to treat aching joints and muscles. The substance acquired its shady reputation when American hucksters began selling mineral oil as Chinese snake oil.Goji berries, said to improve sleep and athletic performance, among other benefits, dry at a farm in Qinghai Province. Demand for the berries is pushing production into new farming areas, such as Qinghai in northwest China, where the berries grow larger. The potency of the berries can vary due to differences in the soil and climate.Falconers with sparrow hawks survey fields of goji berry bushes in Qinghai, looking for birds feeding on the fruit during harvest.But here’s the rub: Studies have shown that fat in the Erabu sea snake, an ingredient in some traditional Chinese remedies, contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Omega-3s are known to reduce inflammation and harmful cholesterol, improve cognition, and help alleviate depression. They are now used in several skin care products. In the 2000s Japanese scientists fed Erabu fat to mice and observed that their ability to swim and to learn their way around mazes improved.“Don’t throw out the baby with the bath water,” Yung-Chi Cheng, a pharmacology professor at Yale School of Medicine, says with a chuckle. “People forget that one of the oldest, most effective, scientifically proven drugs came from traditional medicine—aspirin.” The ancient Egyptians used dried myrtle leaves to treat aches and pains, and Hippocrates, the fourth-century B.C. Greek physician, considered the father of Western medicine, prescribed an extract of willow bark for fevers. But it wasn’t until the 1800s that European scientists figured out that the active ingredient in both is salicylic acid and synthesized it. Today aspirin, at pennies a dose, is arguably the world’s most cost-effective drug.“It all started with people observing willow bark was effective and then using it to treat illness,” Cheng says. “In this case, science followed the medicine, not the other way around.”Aspirin is hardly the only case of a modern drug hiding among traditional treatments. In 1972, the year Cheng finished his Ph.D. in pharmacology at Brown University, a chemist in the People’s Republic of China named Tu Youyou announced the discovery of an antimalarial substance based on a Chinese medicinal herb mentioned in a fourth-century formula.A shop at a market in Guangzhou, China, specializes in deer parts—including antlers, penises, and tendons—used in traditional formulas. One obstacle to acceptance of Chinese medicine in the West is the controversial use of animal parts.During the Vietnam War, Tu had been tapped to work on a secret military project to help the Vietcong combat malaria. The disease accounted for roughly half their casualties. Western health researchers were also trying to solve this problem, screening more than 200,000 compounds. But Tu wondered if an answer might lie in classical Chinese medical texts. She tested several plants related to fever and found a remedy based on a yellow-flowering herb called wormwood (Artemisia annua). The drug derived from her research, called artemisinin, has been credited with saving millions of lives and earned her the 2015 Nobel Prize for medicine.My nose is freaking out as I follow Cheng on a tour of his labyrinthine lab at Yale, where his team is analyzing the characteristics of a variety of herbs to investigate their medicinal value. Amid the sighs and gurgles of various chemical experiments, I catch whiffs of black pepper, rosemary, camphor, ginger, chili, cinnamon, and other scents I can’t identify. The back of my throat tingles. I think I might sneeze. I notice I’m hungry for Thai food.On his desk, Cheng has a bobblehead doll in his likeness. A gift from the staff, it depicts him in a suit rather than the slightly baggy sweaters he generally favors, but it captures his thoughtful demeanor, receding hair, and large earlobes, which according to Chinese tradition signify longevity. On first impression Cheng may seem like a stereotypical advocate for traditional Chinese medicine. Though he’s been in the United States for five decades since emigrating from Taiwan, he still speaks English with a strong accent, and at 74, he comes from a generation of Chinese that still has a deep attachment to many of the old traditions. “But I didn’t really know much about Chinese medicine,” he says, noting that as a child, his parents took him to doctors practicing science-based medicine.Cheng has focused his research solidly in the realm of science, developing antiviral drugs for chronic diseases, such as hepatitis B. But he has also wondered whether there were other cures, based on herbs like wormwood, awaiting rediscovery. Now he’s found one that may prove a breakthrough in cancer treatment. He opens a jar and hands me a pinch of a powder—a mixture of four herbs he calls PHY906.“Taste it,” he says. I put a tiny bit on my tongue. It’s bitter, with hints of licorice.During the 1990s Cheng noted that many cancer patients stopped chemotherapy because of its side effects, including diarrhea and severe nausea. Patients who completed the full course of chemotherapy tended to live the longest, so curbing the side effects, Cheng reasoned, could increase life expectancy. He also knew that Chinese medicine had many herbal treatments for diarrhea and nausea.His colleague Shwu-Huey Liu, an expert in pharmaceutical chemistry who’s fluent in classical Mandarin, searched the Yale library’s large collection of early Chinese medical texts. In an ancient book titled Treatise on Cold Damage, printed on slightly wrinkled bamboo paper, she found an 1,800-year-old recipe for a mixture of skullcap, licorice, peony, and Chinese date, described as a treatment for “diarrhea, abdominal pain, and scorching heat in the anus.”Cheng’s team began trying different blends of the herbal formula. Over the past 20 years, they have proceeded from tests on mice to patients undergoing cancer treatment, overseen by the National Cancer Institute. As Cheng had hoped, almost all the patients who took the herbal formula experienced relief from nausea and other gastrointestinal distress, but something else happened: Their tumors shrank faster than those of patients who hadn’t taken the herbal formula.“I didn’t expect that,” Cheng says. “So now the question is, Why?”Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb, both major producers of cancer drugs, also would like to know the answer. At a pharmaceutical conference in Philadelphia, I listen as Cheng’s son Peikwen explains to representatives from those and other leading drug companies what is known about how PHY906 works. A Stanford University graduate who also has an MBA, Peikwen, 43, joined his father to form a company to market PHY906 and develop other herbal drugs. He’s dressed in a trim charcoal suit, and his fluency in Mandarin, medical terminology, and Silicon Valley argot equip him to bridge the worlds of Eastern and Western medicine and make him a persuasive advocate.After analyzing tumors in mice that were given the formula, Peikwen says, researchers noticed a significant increase in tumor-eating macrophages—white blood cells that gobble up cancer cells. The way the herbs interact appears to be the key. “That’s really where the frontier lies,” Peikwen says. “PHY906 is a cocktail of chemicals—not unlike the drug cocktails that finally proved effective for AIDS patients. We’re just unraveling the original formula and putting it back together in a modern, scientifically based therapy.”To date PHY906 has been used in eight human trials alongside different chemotherapy drugs and radiation to treat colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, Peikwen tells the audience. “We are hopeful that PHY906 will become the first FDA-approved, multi-herb drug.”Afterward, several pharmaceutical reps pull him aside to speak privately.Peikwen and I hurtle into the heart of China on a modern bullet train. The ride is remarkably smooth, as if we’re floating above the track. Meanwhile, ancient China flashes by, an endless patchwork of farms under a gray winter sky. Peikwen agreed to let me visit the source of the herbs if I wouldn’t reveal the full names of the farmers or their locations, which he and his father, along with their partner Sun Ten, a Taiwanese pharmaceutical herb company, consider proprietary information.I can say this part of China looks like a version of Kansas—tabletop flat with neatly furrowed fields as far as I can see. But among the wheat, rice, and rapeseed are plots of herbs tended by thousands of farmers. As the global appetite for herbal remedies has grown, Chinese farmers have devoted increasing amounts of acreage to hundreds of medicinal plant species. In 2017 the nation’s medicinal herb-growing industry generated about $25 billion.But before you quit your job to farm herbs, here’s the problem: Producing medicine-grade herbs is extraordinarily difficult. The chemical potency of each herb can vary greatly, depending on many factors—minerals in the soil, the altitude at which it’s grown, when and how it’s harvested. And then there’s the matter of subspecies that may look exactly alike but have slightly different chemical compositions.Ask a pot smoker about the difference in potency from one marijuana strain to the next, and you’ll get an earful. Or ask a coffee grower: Arabica beans grown in one part of Ethiopia can have six times as much caffeine as those grown in another part of the country. And depending on how they’re ground and brewed, the same beans can yield different caffeine amounts.These complications are part of the reason that the FDA has approved only two herbal prescription drugs—a genital wart treatment made from green tea extract and a diarrhea medicine made from the sap of the South American dragon’s blood tree. Both those drugs contain a single herb, but PHY906 is composed of four, which means more variables must be controlled to make a consistent product. “This complexity is partly why there aren’t any FDA-approved, multi-herb drugs,” Peikwen says.When we finally get to one of the fields that yielded PHY906, I’m frankly a little disappointed. Except for the fact that the farmer, Chen, is speaking Mandarin, he might as well have been from Kansas. Wearing muddy boots, a heavy parka, and a baseball cap, he pulls out his iPhone and asks Siri to translate the Chinese name of his crop into English. “Peony,” she answers.As we tour his fields of peony and skullcap bushes, he explains his crop rotations, soil and water analyses, planting and harvesting protocols. Before shipping the herbs, he says, technicians from Sun Ten perform multiple tests to reconfirm the species; screen for microorganisms, toxins, and heavy metals; and complete other quality checks.“You’ve heard of farm to table,” Peikwen says. “The idea here is farm to bedside.”I tell him that sounds like a marketing slogan. But it’s true, says Chen. “Most companies making herbal remedies don’t get them from farms like this. They get them from Bozhou.”Framed by his library, which includes books on gardening and herbal medicine, Joe Hollis, a master gardener, instructs two of his apprentices, Michaela Shaw and David Hall, as they fill a traditional Chinese herbal prescription.If you buy Chinese herbs on Amazon, there’s a decent chance that they passed through the eastern city of Bozhou, the center of the Chinese medicine universe. Every day 10,000 traders sell thousands of different products to 30,000 buyers from all over Southeast Asia, all of them jammed in a colossal structure resembling a domed football stadium.The morning I visit Bozhou, the market is already a raucous hive of commerce. I zigzag up and down endless aisles, one cavernous room after another, each chock-full of barrels, sacks, pallets, and wheelbarrows heaped with wares derived from what appears to be nearly every plant, mineral, and creature on the planet, including exotic items like deer penises, human placentas, water buffalo bones, and dried seahorses. A section the size of a grocery store is devoted to the cure-all ginseng root—red and white, wild and cultivated, fresh and dried, ranging in price from a few dollars to several thousand. In the insect section, I stop counting the different centipede species at 11.I’ve come here to see the source of most Chinese herbal drugs marketed around the world. You can find seemingly every ingredient here, but you’d have little clue how it was grown or where. Sure enough, I easily find all four ingredients for PHY906—but all are sold by resellers who know little of the herbs’ origins.Before I leave the market, one ingredient catches my eye. In a section near deer antler velvet, I see a glass case with a row of bottles containing yellowish liquid. I ask the vendor what it is, and he gets his neighbor to translate. “Take from bear,” the man says. “Very good.”Paul Iaizzo loves bears. An avid outdoorsman who grew up in Minnesota, he has long been fascinated by the animals, which roam the state’s forests. As head of the University of Minnesota’s Visible Heart Lab, he’s especially interested in their unique physiology and has teamed up with the state’s Department of Natural Resources to study how they hibernate.Tall and lean, with a mane of silver hair, Iaizzo ticks off a list of mysteries related to bears, which spend up to six months completely inactive yet suffer no ill effects. Their breathing slows to as few as two breaths a minute. Their temperature drops by 10 percent, which would cause hypothermia in a human. They regularly lose more than half of their body fat but no muscle. Their hearts can pause for 20 seconds, but their blood never clots. Humans risk deadly clots if their hearts pause for only a few seconds. And yet if a predator approaches, a bear can wake up to defend its den. “And its heart suffers no damage,” Iaizzo says.The earliest mention of bear bile in Chinese literature turns up in a 40-volume treatise from the eighth century called The Medical Secrets of an Official. It prescribes bear bile for liver problems, as well as fever, hemorrhoids, and other ailments. In 1902 a Swedish scientist isolated one of the chemicals in bear bile, later named ursodeoxycholic acid, and it’s now used in drugs for liver diseases and gallstones.But Iaizzo and other researchers believe there are many more secrets to be revealed from bear bile, which is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and secreted as hormones into the bloodstream. They are taking aim at a range of therapies, including treatments for muscular dystrophy and for bedridden patients who can lose half of their muscle mass in three weeks.He’s identified three classes of bile components that likely trigger hibernation and may help heart patients—fatty acids, bile acids, and delta opioids. During the procedure on the pig, he injected a synthetic mixture of these into the protective membrane around the beating heart to coat the organ for an hour before he removed it.Cheng’s team grew this Ganoderma tsugae fungus in the lab. The species has been found to shrink colorectal tumors in animals. “The Chinese have used herbs for centuries,” Cheng says. “The challenge to scientists is to find out which formulas work, and why.”Over hundreds of experiments, he’s seen pig hearts—which are very similar to human hearts—last up to twice as long as they usually do outside the body. There are many possible applications for humans. Most notably, hearts from donors could be kept viable longer and, once inside a recipient, could be restarted faster. Currently, a heart must be transplanted within six hours or less. In the U.S., 300 people die every year waiting for hearts.“If we could preserve a heart for 24 hours, we could get it anywhere in the world,” Iaizzo says. “And that could vastly increase the number of available organs. That would be a game changer.”I ask him whether the Chinese practice of drinking bear bile could really bestow any health benefits. “It could,” Iaizzo says, noting the chemicals would enter the bloodstream and move through the heart and other organs. He doesn’t condone farming bears for their bile, emphasizing that the chemicals can be synthesized, but the science is the science. And though the ancient Chinese didn’t understand how bear bile helped humans, they observed that it did.As I hold the pig heart, I can feel its rhythm slowing. It finally stops. The pig died hours ago, and now its heart has stopped too. Its color seems to dim—like a mahi-mahi that loses its lightning yellow glow as it dies in the hands of a fisherman. I wonder if whatever is now gone is what the ancient Chinese meant by qi.I think of the moment in the hospital when I was holding my father’s hand and felt his pulse finally stop. I’m suddenly aware of my own heart, flexing and lurching inside my rib cage, and wonder about its other mysteries.",
"A Greenland shark swims under the ice in Lancaster Sound off Nunavut, Canada.It's no fish tale: The Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on the planet, a new study says.The animal, native to the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic, can live to at least 272 years—and possibly to the ripe old age of 500. (Related: "Meet the Animal That Lives for 11,000 Years.")“We had an expectation that they would be very long-lived animals, but I was surprised that they turned out to be as old as they did,” says study leader Julius Nielsen, a biologist at the University of Copenhagen.Because of its remote habitat and elusive nature, the giant shark is poorly understood, including how long it lives.Some research had suggested they grow extremely slowly, less than half an inch (a centimeter) per year, suggesting a life span well beyond those of other vertebrates.Determining a bony fish's age can be easily done by analyzing their otoliths, or ear stones. But sharks, which are made mostly of cartilage, lack this kind of hard, calcified tissue. (Read more about sharks, the lords of the sea, in National Geographic magazine.)So scientists found another way to figure out the age of Greenland sharks: looking into their eyes.The researchers analyzed 28 female Greenland sharks that had died accidentally during the Greenland Institute for Natural Resources’ commercial fish-monitoring program.“The secret behind the success of this study is that we had young and old animals, medium-sized and large animals, and we could compare them all,” Nielsen notes.Greenland sharks have a unique eye structure in that the lens grows throughout an animal’s lifetime. The older an animal gets, the more layers are added to the lens. Scientists can't count the layers as they would tree rings, but they can remove all the layers that have been added over the years until they reach the center, or the embryonic nucleus, of the lens. (See "Rare Whales Can Live to Nearly 200, Eye Tissue Reveals.")This tissue is composed of proteins that were formed when the shark was a young pup. Scientists can analyze the chemical composition of the eye lens nucleus to estimate an animal’s age.Radiocarbon dating of the 28 Greenland sharks' lens nuclei revealed a maximum life span of at least 272 years, according to the study, published August 11 in the journal Science.A Greenland was shark accidentally caught as bycatch on a research vessel in southwestern Greenland.The largest shark in the study, at 16.5 feet (five meters) in length, was estimated to be approximately 392 years old. Nielsen says there is some uncertainty around that estimate. He and his colleagues determined with 95 percent certainty that the shark was between 272 and 512 years old, and it was most likely around 390.What’s more, because female Greenland sharks are reported to reach sexual maturity at lengths greater than 13 feet (four meters), they likely would start breeding at 156 years of age.It's unknown why they live so long, but cold environments cause low body temperatures, which in turn means slow metabolism—and thus less damage to animals' tissues.These results are crucial, Nielsen says, because the Greenland shark population is unknown. If the species is rare, the death of even one long-lived animal could be a huge loss. (See "Slow Sharks Sneak Up on Sleeping Seals [and Eat Them]?")Not only is the shark sometimes caught by accident during fishing—a phenomenon called bycatch—but its habitat may be disturbed by climate change and many countries' increased focus on the Arctic for fishing, oil, and other natural resources.“The longevity is remarkable, but I hope the public recognizes how important that is with regard to how we manage and conserve Arctic and deepwater ecosystems,” says Aaron Fisk, an ecologist at the University of Windsor who was not involved with this research.“If Greenland sharks live this long and don’t reproduce until they are 150 years old, their population is vulnerable to exploitation.”Nielsen agrees: “It’s important for policymakers to keep in mind that this is an extremely long-lived and slowly maturing animal."Fisheries should do what they can to minimize bycatch. We need to have some respect for them.”Follow Mary Bates on Twitter and Facebook.",
"A beekeeper pulls a section of honeycomb from a hive.Part of our weekly "In Focus" series—stepping back, looking closer.Bees are back in the news this spring, if not back in fields pollinating this summer's crops. The European Union (EU) has announced that it will ban, for two years, the use of neonicotinoids, the much-maligned pesticide group often fingered in honeybee declines. The U.S. hasn't followed suit, though this year a group of beekeepers and environmental and consumer groups sued the EPA for not doing enough to protect bees from the pesticide onslaught.For the last several years scientists have fretted over the future of bees, and although research has shed much light on the crisis, those in the bee business—from hive keepers to commercial farmers—say the insects remain in deep trouble as their colonies continue to struggle.The current crisis arose during the fall of 2006 as beekeepers around the country reported massive losses—more than a third of hives on average and up to 90 percent in some cases. Bees were flying away and simply not coming back; keepers would find boxes empty of adult bees except for a live queen. No bee corpses remained to tell the tale. The losses were unprecedented and fast.Now it's five years later, and though colony collapse disorder (CCD)—the name given to the mysterious killer condition—has dwindled in the manner of cyclical diseases, bees are still battling for their lives and their colonies are weaker than ever. The latest data, from the 2012-2013 winter, indicate an average loss of 45.1 percent of hives across all U.S. beekeepers, up 78.2 percent from the previous winter, and a total loss of 31.1 percent of commercial hives, on par with the last six years. (Most keepers now consider a 15 percent loss "acceptable.")Unprecedented Pollinator CrisisWhy keep worrying over the fate of a bunch of pesky stinging insects? Bees in their crucial role as pollinators are paramount. Western nations rely heavily on managed honeybees—the "moveable force" of bees that ride in trucks from farm to farm—to keep commercial agriculture productive. About a third of our foods (some 100 key crops) rely on these insects, including apples, nuts, all the favorite summer fruits (like blueberries and strawberries), alfalfa (which cows eat), and guar bean (used in all kinds of products). In total, bees contribute more than $15 billion to U.S. crop production, hardly small potatoes.No, we wouldn't starve without their services—much of the world lives without managed pollinators. But we'd lose an awful lot of good, healthy food, from cherries and broccoli to onions and almonds. Or we'd pay exorbitant costs for farmers to use some other, less efficient pollination technique to supplement the work that healthy natural pollinators could do. Plus, bee health can tell us a lot about environmental health, and thus about our own well-being.A man uses smoke to harvest honey from a honeycomb.Today's pollinator crisis, which has also hit Europe and now parts of Asia, is unprecedented. But honeybees have done disappearing acts on and off for more than a century, possibly since humans began domesticating them 4,500 years ago in Egypt. In the United States, unexplained colony declines in the 1880s, the 1920s, and the 1960s baffled farmers, and in 1995-1996 Pennsylvania keepers lost more than half of their colonies without a clear cause. The 1980s and 1990s saw various new parasites that hit bees hard; Varroa and tracheal mites became major killers, and they continue to plague hives and keep beekeepers up at night.When CCD appeared, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture joined forces to study and fight the assailant, but a half-dozen years later they still lack a smoking gun. Recent work reveals higher loads of pathogens in the guts of bees from collapsed colonies versus healthy ones—making viral infections a likely culprit.But this isn't a case of one cause, one effect. Bee expert Dennis vanEngelsdorp of the University of Maryland likens the situation to HIV/AIDS in humans. "You don't die of AIDS; you die of pneumonia or some other condition that hits when your immunity is down," he says. Today's bee mortalities may be behaving slightly differently. "But we're pretty sure in all these cases, diseases are the tipping point" after bees' immune systems are compromised.So what makes bees vulnerable to those diseases, what's killing their immunity, continues to be the $15-billion question.Problems Piling UpZac Browning is a fourth-generation beekeeper based in North Dakota. His mostly migratory commercial operation runs about 22,000 hives in three states—meaning he trucks his bees to different locations at different times of year, renting out their pollination services to big farms like those producing almonds in California and canola in Idaho.CCD devastated his hives a few years back, but "we've seen losses more recently from everything imaginable," he says. "Pests, parasites, pesticide exposure, starvation, queen failures, you name it."In addition to these problems piling up, "our inputs have gone up one-and-a-half times in the last decade," he says. "We now have to try to sustain bees [with extra food] when natural food is scarce, dearth periods that didn't exist before."Part of the problem is keepers have to boost hive numbers to meet demand, "but the carrying capacity of the environment hasn't changed." In fact, it's gone down. The amount of undeveloped land with good bee forage just isn't enough to sustain the masses, he says.Meanwhile, studies have shown that colonies with access to the best pollens (with more than 25 percent protein plus essential amino acids), which occur in diverse plant habitats once common across the landscape, are more robust and more resistant to disease than those in pollen-poor environments.The Threat From PesticidesAnother adversary in the bees' battle, as the EU reminds us, is pesticides. Pesticides themselves aren't necessarily a death sentence for bees—and debate rages over whether, when properly applied, these chemicals can be used safely among pollinators. But exposure to them seems to open the door to other killers.For example, bees exposed to sublethal doses of neonicotinoids—the type the EU is banning and that are used routinely in the U.S. on wheat, corn, soy, and cotton crops—become more easily infected by the gut parasite Nosema.Meanwhile, last year a French study indicated that this same class of chemicals can fog honeybee brains and alter behavior. And a British study on bumblebees, a natural pollinator in decline in many places, reported neonicotinoids keep bees from supplying their hives with enough food for queen production.",
"White fungus covers the muzzles of infected little brown bats hibernating in a West Virginia cave. The illness is responsible for dramatic declines in several bat species, including the little brown bat.A deadly invasive fungus has been wiping out hibernating bats for years in the U.S., eating away at their wings and muzzles. But it's been unclear exactly how the interloper kills its victims, making efforts to save infected bats take a bit of guesswork.Now, a recent study has cracked the mystery. White-nose syndrome—so called because researchers first observed the white fungus growing on bat noses in Albany, New York—causes severe dehydration and tampers with a bat's body chemistry. This discovery, which confirms previous studies, could point the way to possible treatments or strategies to minimize the disease's impact on North America's bats. (See "Deadly Bat Fungus Spreading in U.S.")The fungus has spread along eastern North America into Canada and down to South Carolina and west as far as Missouri. Some populations in Pennsylvania have declined as much as 99 percent, and seven hibernating bat species in the U.S. and Canada have confirmed cases.In the lab, the study authors discovered that infected little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) burn twice the energy during hibernation as uninfected individuals do. Sick bats also suffer from relatively acidic blood, which disrupts enzyme function and causes dehydration. The researchers published their results in December in the journal BMC Physiology.These internal changes occurred in the early stages of infection, which surprised lead study author Michelle Verant, a veterinarian getting her doctorate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Obvious signs of the disease—such as daytime flying, an increase in how often the bats wake up from hibernation, and visible growth of the fungus on the wings and muzzle—occur later."Finding these potentially life-threatening changes even before we see signs suggests [white-nose syndrome] is a more chronic disease," she said. The fungus acts as an energy-suck all winter, draining a bat's life away and causing the abnormal behavior in later stages that exacerbate the animal's condition. (See "Bats May Be Wiped Out by Fungus in U.S. Northeast.")Holes and lesions in the wing of this dead little brown bat are courtesy of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome.The illness affects only hibernating bats. The fungus prefers cold, humid environments around 40° to 50°F (4° to 10°C)—exactly the kinds of conditions found in hibernation caves. Some sites have 99 to 100 percent humidity, said Greg Turner, a wildlife biologist with the Pennsylvania Game Commission.If a sick bat survives the winter, the animal can recover if its wings aren't too shredded from the fungus and if it has enough energy to search for food, said Turner, who was not involved in the study. Turner and colleagues have also been able to rehabilitate sick bats emerging from hibernation by providing water and food.However, surviving the syndrome one winter is no guarantee that the same individual won't get sick again the following winter, said study author Verant. Bats don't build up immunity to the fungus, so they can fall ill over and over again.The record-holder for reinfection was a bat that got sick every year for five years, she said.Fortunately, there are signs that bat populations exposed to white-nose syndrome for several years are starting to adapt, said Turner. Population declines in some areas of New York and Pennsylvania aren't as horrendous as in previous years. And the wildlife biologist has evidence that some adult survivors are packing on more body fat before they hibernate.When the fungus arrives in a new area—spread either by humans or the arrival of infected bats—massive die-offs occur among certain species for about two years, Turner explained. Not every species is as susceptible as others—the little brown bat, unfortunately, is one of the hardest hit thanks to its preference for cold, humid caves. (Read "Twilight for Bats" in National Geographic magazine.)The death rate starts to slow down after about two years and seems to stabilize around year six, Turner said. Whether those relatively stable population numbers are due to increased survival or to new bats arriving in the area remains to be seen.However, "we're very hopeful that we've hit rock bottom and we're starting to see a trend upward," Turner said. "We're analyzing that data as fast as we can."Follow Jane J. Lee on Twitter.",
"The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a doomsday shelter for the food supply, is tucked into a remote mountain on Spitsbergen, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago.Longyearbyen, SvalbardThe windshield wipers on the SUV work overtime as Åsmund Asdal zigzags up the fog-covered mountain to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.“The main reason we have civilization is that humans developed ways of using seeds,” says Asdal, the operations and management coordinator of the facility, as he peers over the steering wheel through the haze.Today the wide range of plants that humans have relied on throughout history is threatened by the clones of modern industrial agriculture, new diseases, and climate change. The storage vault—in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago 800 miles above the Arctic Circle—was designed to ensure that nature’s vast array of genes is not lost.At the entrance tunnel to the warehouse, the wind is drowned out by the roar of a cooling system that deepens the freeze in the space to minus 18°C (0°F)—a temperature ensuring that seed samples stay viable in the event of a global cataclysm.“People call the vault a Noah’s Ark for seeds,” says Asdal, a biologist and agronomist. “I think that's quite a good comparison.” But now, on its tenth anniversary, the initiative is confronting one of the very forces it is meant to protect against: global warming.A small drainage ditch in front of the entrance diverts rainwater streaming down the cold rock of the mountain. Twenty years ago, this trench might have been sufficient. Svalbard was thought to be the perfect place to preserve and store seeds because it is a polar desert—cold and dry, with little snow and not much rain.In a cruelly ironic twist for what is meant to be a doomsday backup for civilization, climate change is working faster here than in many other places around the world. This has meant warming temperatures, avalanches, rain and, most damaging for the seed vault, melting permafrost. As the globe warms, this small ditch is not enough to protect the warehouse from surface runoff.A worker carries newly arrived boxes containing seeds from Japan and the United States. National seed banks provide samples to the Svalbard vault, a global backup for protecting the genotypes of agricultural staples such as wheat.Currently, the facility holds around 930,000 seed samples representing 5,000 plant species. They’re stored behind heavy doors covered in a layer of glittering ice, in three big rooms deep inside the mountain. The vault is said to be an ideal location for long-term storage, partly because permafrost offers cost-effective freezing–and it would take a long time to thaw in case of a power outage.The vault was founded as a safety net for national seed banks, which donated the samples. It does not store the seeds of endangered plants; it protects the genetic material of the foods we see on our plates every day, as well as the wild relatives of these plants.“We keep plants here that are important for the production of food,” Asdal says. Those staples include around 140,000 different samples of wheat varieties; 150,000 samples of rice; 70,000 samples of barley; and between 10,000 and 20,000 samples each of different kinds of potatoes, peas, sorghum, and many other crops.Aside from an apocalypse—nuclear war, asteroids—there are multiple threats facing farming today. Industrial agriculture relies on monocrops of clones, so one pest could potentially wipe out an entire susceptible variety. (Read about the threat to bananas.) Climate change means one drought could wipe out a non-resilient strain.As an example, farmers used to grow 1,700 different kinds of rice in Taiwan, says Ann Tutwiler, director of Bioversity International, a conservation organization focusing on biodiversity. Today, only three varieties make up 82 percent of the island’s farmed area.Behind ice-covered doors, the facility holds around 930,000 seed samples representing 5,000 plant species.(See how the seed vault was opened because of war in Syria.)“When you have monocultures or plant a very narrow range of varieties, they're very susceptible to pests and diseases and can easily be quite vulnerable to different climate change threats,” says Tutwiler. “People diversify their financial portfolios, so why aren't we diversifying our agriculture system?”Historically, farmers did just that. They relied on an assortment of varieties. If one kind of wheat succumbed to an infestation or a lack of water, a slightly different neighbor might thrive.As we drive back from the vault to town, Asdal describes growing up on the family farm in southern Norway—and the dramatic shift to modern farming.“Suddenly in 1975,” he says, “all the fields were covered with grass, feed for the animals, and the only animals left on the farm were cows producing milk. This is actually the story of agriculture. It very quickly went from a diverse, self-sufficient farming system to an industrial way of producing food. Each farm now produces one crop, one very specialized product.”The vault is carved into Arctic permafrost, which has an ideal temperature for preserving the seed samples.Crop Trust, which partnered with the Norwegian government to build the vault a decade ago, says it can safeguard the food supply. With seed banks, scientists and plant breeders can continue to use the material to engineer crops with qualities that make them more resilient. “Genotypes would be lost if gene banks did not secure them,” says Asdal. (Learn about the revival of one ancient grain.)This protection plan was threatened in May 2017, when the entrance tunnel to the vault sprang a leak. Water and then ice rapidly covered the floor of the 1,400-foot passage into the mountain, though the storage chambers themselves were never at risk.“It was a very extraordinary amount of rain that came down in a very short period of time,” says Synnove Sandberg, director of construction for Statsbygg, the Norwegian government agency responsible for state-owned land and buildings, including the vault.The Norwegian government subsequently spent almost $4.7 million waterproofing the tunnel, removing heat sources that could melt permafrost, and digging drainage channels in the mountainside above the vault. The country is expected to commit an additional $6.3 million for another round of upgrades to better insulate the vault from the changing environment.“It's warmer now than it has ever been, and we will be prepared for an even warmer climate and even more water and rain,” says Hege Aschim, Statsbygg communications director.The torrential downpours have also unleashed avalanches. In mid-December a violent storm hit the region, and residents were ordered to evacuate homes in avalanche-threatened areas of Longyearbyen—the archipelago’s main city, located near the vault. The precaution was taken after other avalanches struck the area, including one in December 2015 that killed a child and an elementary school teacher and seriously injured dozens of others.“All the houses were just moved—10, 20, 30 meters—closer to ours. We almost had houses on our front staircase,” says Espen Rotevatn, a teacher and city council member, describing how the homes of his neighbors were picked up and blasted across the street when the wall of snow hit. Like all the buildings in town, the homes were built on wooden piles sunk into permafrost—and the piles are now rotting because the permafrost is melting.The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is located in Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost settlement. It was chosen for its isolated, Arctic location, but accelerated melting and extreme weather have wrought unforeseen challenges.But even with these recent disasters, not everyone in the archipelago is convinced that climate change is happening here. “This is extremely absurd since we're maybe at the one place in the world where you can see it with your own eyes,” says Rotevatn.After Asdal drops me off in rainy downtown Longyearbyen, I face the 1.5-mile trek to my bunkhouse, which has a view of the glacier-fed torrent that flows down a gully through the city. Worried about polar bears and soaked by rain, I try to hitchhike. After a few trucks pass by, Kristin Mork pulls up. Unlike most residents of this coal-mining station turned research and tourism hub, she grew up here. Her late father was mayor in the 1980s, and he’s buried in the local cemetery, which was miraculously spared when the biggest landslide in 40 years hit the town last summer.How often do people talk about climate change on Svalbard? “All the time,” says Mork. Although residents are divided on how dangerous it could be, most agree that it has worsened, she says, especially after the avalanches. And they're responding. “The city is kind of slowly moving,” she says, referring to plans to build out in the middle of the valley, away from the steep slopes.Changes to the climate are well documented. The archipelago experiences polar amplification, a phenomenon that causes the Arctic and Antarctic to warm faster than the rest of the planet. “Svalbard is the bull's eye for where Arctic warming is taking place. It's predicted to have the most warming of any place on the planet in the next 100 years,” says William D’Andrea, a biologist and paleoclimatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.[Read more about D’Andrea’s most recent expedition.]He and many of his colleagues see peril for the town—and the seed vault. “This area was described as a polar desert with only 250 millimeters [almost 10 inches] of precipitation a year,” says Jostein Bakke, who’s with Norway’s Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bergen. Last winter, he noted, 60 millimeters [almost 2.5 inches] fell in just one day.“It's a very dramatic shift,” says Bakke, who has been studying climate in the island chain for almost 20 years.Regardless of what will happen in Longyearbyen, the storage facility will stay. “There’s no question of changing its place,” says Statsbygg’s Aschim. “The seeds are safe inside the mountain—it’s the entrance that is causing the problems.”By spring 2019, Statsbygg projects that the climate-proofing upgrades to the tunnel leading to the vault will be complete. The agency will convert the current rock tunnel into a concrete passageway, install cooling pipes on its exterior and cover it with frozen mats, and then replace the soil. “It was built with the idea that the permafrost should reestablish and take care of the tunnel, but it did not,” says Aschim. “So we will help nature.”For his part, Asdal sees the work of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault continuing—also with the aim of helping nature. “We do not know what the future will bring, but at least this is a kind of insurance for keeping the genes that we will need when the climate changes, when we need more food,” he says. “At least this is a measure that will make the future easier for us.”",
"As melting permafrost releases mercury, some will make it into the food chain—and into animals such as these Alaskan caribou.Scientists have uncovered another hidden threat buried in the icy frozen north—massive natural reserves of mercury, a toxic heavy metal that in some forms can build up in fish and other animals and cause serious health problems in humans.A study published Monday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters reports that the amount of natural mercury bound up in Arctic permafrost may be 10 times greater than all the mercury humans have pumped into the atmosphere from coal-burning and other pollution sources over the last 30 years. As climate change warms the land, this thawing permafrost could release significant quantities of mercury back into the environment, potentially allowing far more of the pollutant to build up in the atmosphere and the food web."Prior to the start of the study, people assumed permafrost contained little to no mercury," says study co-author Kevin Schaefer of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. "But it turns out that not only is there mercury in permafrost, it's also the biggest pool of mercury on the planet."Put another way, says lead author Paul Schuster, a U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist, "This is a complete game-changer for mercury. It's a natural source, but some of it will be released through what we're doing with climate change."What's not yet clear, however, is how much mercury could be released, or when, in a form that is toxic to humans.Mercury is found naturally in the environment and is released by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and the weathering of rock. But roughly two-thirds of the mercury in the air at any one time is released by humans, primarily through the burning of coal or medical waste or some types of mining. Once airborne, mercury eventually falls back to Earth, winding up in water or on land. There it’s picked up by fish and animals, accumulating in ever-higher amounts as it works its way up the food web.In some forms, mercury is a powerful neurotoxin, and in children it can harm brain development, affecting cognition, memory, language and even motor and visual skills. Even in adults, excessive amounts can hamper vision, speech and muscle movements, compromise the reproductive and immune systems, and cause cardiovascular problems. That's why there are often fish advisories for mercury near polluted rivers and streams, and why children and pregnant women are urged to avoid eating tuna or other long-lived fish such as swordfish.Thanks to complex atmospheric and ocean processes, more mercury winds up in the high northern latitudes than anywhere else. It’s already known to build up there in birds, fish, seals, walrus, polar bears and some whales, even in areas thousands of miles from pollution sources. As a result of this long-distance pollution, indigenous people across the Arctic who rely on subsistence hunting for food have some of the highest levels of mercury in their blood.The same winds and currents that send mercury north today have been at work for tens of thousands of years, depositing natural mercury in high concentrations across the Arctic. Since that mercury has been trapped in frozen ground for millennia, it hasn't done damage to wildlife or humans. But now Arctic permafrost, which accounts for 24 percent of all land in the Northern Hemisphere, is thawing and threatening to release this massive store. And, until recently, we didn't have any idea how much was there.At USGS Schuster has been studying mercury in the atmosphere for several decades. In the 1990s he collected ice core samples from a glacier in Wyoming's Wind River Range and developed a record of mercury deposition dating back to before the Industrial Revolution. That work, he says, eventually played a role in convincing federal regulators that human sources of mercury had risen so much that that the U.S. should start requiring coal-burning facilities to use scrubbers to cut mercury from their emissions.Eventually, Schuster found his way to Alaska's Yukon River basin and realized that no one had ever attempted to quantify how much mercury might be stored in permafrost. In fact, not every expert was convinced there would be much there at all.Between 2004 and 2012, Schuster and his team collected more than 13 ice core samples from around Alaska. They chose their sites—and spent years perfecting models—in such a way that the results from Alaska could be extrapolated to permafrost all over the Arctic.The results show that Arctic permafrost holds roughly 15 million gallons of mercury—at least twice the amount contained in the oceans, atmosphere and all other land combined. "The concentrations were huge—a lot higher than we expected them to be," Schuster says. "That was a big surprise."The big question is: What’s going to happen to that mercury?It's unlikely that all of it will stay sequestered in permafrost. Once the ground begins to thaw, plants will grow in it, taking up mercury, and the microbes that decompose the plants will release some amount of methylmercury, a more toxic form. Some portion of that will spread through water or air into the ecosystem and eventually into animals."That's the vector, the avenue into the food chain," Schuster says.But determining how significant a risk that will pose is a challenge.First off, how much temperatures warm depends on how quickly—or not—humans limit emissions of greenhouse gases. That will determine how much permafrost thaws, which will influence how much mercury gets released. But even that is only part of the equation."How much winds up in the food web, and where? That's the $100,000 question," Schuster says. "When you jump over to the food chain in this research, things get gray."Mercury releases initially would pose increased risks to Arctic people and wildlife, "but what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic," Schaefer says. "Eventually it would be dispersed throughout the Earth. It moves around."The bottom line is there will almost certainly be some impact to humans."We know permafrost is going to thaw and we know some portion of the mercury will be released," Schaefer says. "At this point we don't have specific estimates about how much or when—that's the next phase of our research."",

This week the organization asked for some of their seeds back from the doomsday vault as a precautionary measure to duplicate the material. Those seeds are needed by plant researchers who are working on the next crops to be planted in the Middle East and beyond, in order to try to stay a step ahead of pests and drought and increase yields to feed a growing population.Scientists have specifically requested drought-friendly seeds of wheat, barley, and grasses from the vault, which is tucked into an Arctic mountainside on the archipelago of Svalbard, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) from the North Pole.The Svalbard seed bank opened on the island of Longyearbyen in 2008 and contains around 860,000 samples, from countries all over the globe. It was designed to serve as the ultimate safety net for food security in case of nuclear war, asteroid impact, or other apocalyptic scenarios. The mostly subterranean facility was designed to protect up to 2.25 billion seeds. (Learn more about the seed vault.)“I'd say doomsday is happening every day for crop varieties,” Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which helps manage the facility, said in a previous interview.“Lots of people think that this vault is waiting for doomsday before we use it. But it's really a backup plan for seeds and crops. We are losing seed diversity every day and this is the insurance policy for that,” said Fowler, referring to the fact that many crop varieties are disappearing thanks to shifts in weather, societal preferences, and market pressures.In fact, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that three-quarters of the world's crop biodiversity is no longer being planted in farmers’ fields. When crops are consolidated they become more vulnerable to disease, pests, droughts, or other threats. The genetic diversity found in the vault provides a critical safety net, the agency says.Even a seemingly simple crop, such as wheat, may have 200,000 different varieties. And each variety has a suite of individual traits that determine how it fares in high or low temperatures, during droughts, or against certain diseases or pests.“Even conservative projections of changing climate now indicate that by mid-century huge areas of some countries, in Africa for example, will be experiencing climates that are unlike any that have existed since the beginning of agriculture in those countries,” Fowler explained.“How will they become adapted to future climates? One way they can is by tapping into this rich storehouse of diversity and breeding new crops with traits that allow them to succeed in those climates. It's essential to future food security,” Fowler said.And thanks to war in Syria, scientists have tapped that resource for the first time. Seed vaults have previously been destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and one was badly damaged by a flood in the Philippines.This story was updated at 11:40 a.m. ET on September 28 to clarify that the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas has distributed their staff across eight countries, that the seed bank in Aleppo is in fact not damaged (but is only able to operate in a limited fashion), and that seeds from the center are distributed to other parts of the world in addition to the Middle East.",
"Nordaustlandet, SvalbardThe boat shot up the deep blue face of the wave, broke through its lip, hung silently in space for a moment, and then slammed back into the sea. The shock reverberated through the aluminum hull, amplifying the vibrating hum of the mast straining in a force eight gale. As the vessel plunged down nose first, the frothing cobalt waters of the Arctic Ocean rose and blocked the view of the snow-covered spikes of Nordaustlandet, in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago. Powered by 45-mile-per hour winds of heavy, cold air, another 20-foot wave caught the sailboat on its side, sending the crew of paleoclimatologists reeling.After giving a six-hour beating, the unexpected storm showed no signs of weakening. Skipper Mario Acquarone made a hazardous, high speed turn through close packed waves and retreated. Just the day before, on this inaccessible coast at 80 degrees north, the crew of scientists had cored sediment samples of a little explored lake and glacier system. They hoped their research would yield several millennia of climate change data so detailed it would provide records on a decade level—documentation of climate change relevant to a human lifetime—and help them more clearly predict the effects of a warmer future.For five years they had been trying to reach Lake Ringgåsvatnet and Ahlmannfonna glacier, but every time they had been routed by epic storms or blocked by pack ice. Now they were eager to get back and analyze their bounty of mud—but first they had to survive the gale.“This is hardcore science,” said Ray Bradley, the oldest and most experienced Arctic researcher on the trip, as the boat anchored in the safer but still treacherous confines of Innvika cove later in the day. After fifteen hours of heaving seas, the director of the Climate System Research Center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst was finally able to make a bowl of oatmeal. “People always forget when they see a graph on a piece of paper […] all the hard effort that went into getting that,” he said. “In many places you're putting your life on the line to get these records.”Indeed, the expedition faced numerous dangers to collect data from this remote location high in the Norwegian Arctic—not only four storms in nine days, but also the constant threat of polar bear attack, the risk of striking a rock and sinking in uncharted fjords, and low-lying icebergs. Most ominously, starvation was possible if the fickle winds shifted, pushing the polar ice south in a matter of hours and locking the boat and its crew in a fjord too distant for helicopter rescue. All of this for some mud.But this is not just any mud. “What we’re hoping is that the sediment found at the bottom of the lake will give us essentially a history of how the icecap has survived—or grown or shrunk—over time. So we’re trying to put the present condition of the environment here in a long-term context,” said Bradley, whose English accent has been almost entirely lost to Boston. “We wanted to come here because it is essentially the canary in the coal mine for giving us some indication of how the climate will change in the future and how it has changed in the past.”The sediment cores are “natural archives of past environmental change,” he says. “What we want to do is basically open that library and read the story of the sediments.”Lake Ringgåsvatnet is important because it is an unfrozen body of fresh water in the extreme north of the planet, warmed by the tail end of the Gulf Stream. Also, it is fed by only one ice cap and its bottom sediments have not been scoured clean by a glacier, so it has a clear historical signal. Ahlmannfonna glacier is important because it is a small ice cap and stands alone, so it is especially prey to changes in climate. Studying the layers of glacial sediments washed into the lake will reveal how the glacier has changed and thus show how the climate has changed.To reach such an illuminating spot is dangerous, but Bradley is no stranger to risk. In 2005 he was embroiled in what became known as the Hockey Stick Controversy after Congressional Republicans attacked him, and his colleagues, for an historic climate graph published in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. The table showed a dramatic spike in global mean temperatures that coincided with the Industrial Revolution—strong evidence humans were causing global warming.“They decided the best way to put down the credibility of the IPCC report was to attack the scientists, rather than the science,” said Bradley. During the “political shenanigans,” as Bradley describes it, the chairman leading the attack, Joe Barton of Texas, addressed an open letter to his constituents, dismissively writing that the science was, “all indoor work and no heavy lifting.”William D'Andrea, a paleoclimatologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, looks out for bears while surveying a boulder field between Ahlmannfonna glacier and Lake Ringgåsvatnet.In the days before the storm, we spot a polar bear and her cubs on a hillside and see blue whales and humpbacks blowing spouts against a backdrop of glaciers flowing down into the sea. Finally, after 48 hours on the ocean, we approach our Rubicon: the narrow gap between the north-pointing Platen Peninsula and the Arctic ice pack just 20 nautical miles away.“We have been trying to do this trip for five years and we have had a lot of issues with ice,” says expedition leader Jostein Bakke, head of the Quaternary Earth Systems group at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bergen, in Norway. “It's not the safest type of expedition,” he says. If the winds turned and pushed the ice south, it would be just hours before the boat was trapped. “We are pushing the limits of what you can do.”This day, there is no ice. As we sail past the aptly named Goodenough Mountain on the tip of the peninsula, Acquarone, a marine mammal researcher and president of the European Cetacean Society who has been sailing the archipelago for two decades, says the lack of ice is good and bad. “On the one side it's exciting because we have the possibility of visiting new areas that were previously ice locked. But, on the other hand, it's kind of scary because it's a sign that things are changing very, very fast.”Now past the point of no return, the boat rounds south and into the uncharted Innvika cove. Examining spotty weather forecasts, the climatologists see they have just an eight-hour window to unload hundreds of pounds of equipment and get it ashore before another gale strikes. As we get ready to land the gear, Bradley says, “We're about to see that it’s not all indoor work and it’s definitely a lot of heavy lifting.”Even though it is difficult, and sometimes impossible to get here, this lake and glacier system will help paleoclimatologists tell a bigger story about the climate. “Svalbard is a very sensitive place,” says Bakke. Because of this, it uniquely can help them put climatic changes into a longer term perspective.Maybe more importantly, they want to understand why there seem to be “steps” in the ancient climate record—times when the system seemed to suddenly shift. “For future climate that's very important because you have these thresholds, and once we cross them there's no way back,” Bakke says. “Hopefully our research can help to get better predictions for the future. Then we can be prepared for what's going to happen in the next hundred years.”To do this, the researchers will gather the cores and other data about the area. Back at the lab, they will carefully cut the plastic coring tubes open, run a piano wire down the length, and split the soggy mud open like the two halves of a book.Carbon dating pegs the ages of the layers of sediments. Mineral-rich layers point to glaciers growing in cold periods, as they grind up stone and it is washed into a lake. Layers of organic sediment mean a glacier retreated from a lake during warm periods, thus producing less ground-up stone. “We can look through time and see when the glaciers have been big and when they've been small, how abruptly they've changed, and how dynamic they’ve been throughout the last 10,000 years,” says William D’Andrea, a climatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.D’Andrea studies plant waxes and fat molecules and dead algae that are preserved in the cores. The kind and amount of these substances can tell him the temperature of an ancient lake and how much precipitation there was at different times.“The main thing we're after is temperature and precipitation,” he says. “Those are the two things that matter to you on any given day—is it going to rain and should I be wearing a T-shirt or a sweater?”The team of scientists prepares a tube for the coring of lake sediments on the shore of Lake Ringgåsvatnet.Around 9,500 years ago, the climate in Svalbard was T-shirt weather, much warmer than it is today. And the paleoclimatologists think that climate could be where the Arctic is headed again. Better understanding exactly what happened in the past can thus help us better predict the near future.Yet, while many people now understand that the climate is changing, the process is relatively slow compared to our day-to-day lives. Because of this, it is often hard to focus the public’s attention. This team hopes to pull finely layered cores that will allow them to show ancient climate changes on the scale of decades, instead of millennia.“Just 30 years from now, when your kids are older, when your grandchildren are around, the climate will be very different,” says Bradley. “We’re trying to get a history at a very fine resolution, on a timescale that is relevant for people.”On the deck of the boat, the scientists get ready to go ashore and start the heavy lifting. They load three old Mauser carbines with soft-nosed bullets, inspect five flare guns, and have a serious talk about polar bear safety. A single curious seal follows the zodiac raft in as they look for a staging spot. Returning, they unstrap brown plastic tubes you could buy at any plumbing store. The coring tools would not have been out of place on an 1850s oil rig. Dozens of trips transport two inflatable boats, 400 pounds of drilling platforms, coring weights, a solid metal jack, a piston for driving the tubes into the mud, two boat engines, at least fifty meters of pipe, and an assortment of other equipment. Then the work starts.Between the shore and the lake is a mile of boggy, broken ground. Carrying 90-pound sections of platform, our heavy steps are swallowed by spongy layers of ancient mosses. Other times we sink to the top of our boots in sucking mud. Ankle-breaking boulders lie everywhere. Running from a bear seems impossible. At last, the goal of the expedition comes into view: the 100-foot-deep, mile long Lake Ringgåsvatnet.The wind is picking up and the team hurriedly assembles the equipment. I’m given a rifle and am told to watch out for polar bears. We get to the sailboat just before the storm. For the next 24 hours, it shrieks at 70 miles per hour, churning the shallow cove. Again and again the anchor slips and the aluminum-skinned yacht is driven perilously close to the rocks. “It’s a real Arctic experience,” says Acquarone.The sailboat sits at anchor on a calm day off the Svalbard archipelago.At last, the gusts die down. Under a midnight sun shrouded in heavy gray clouds, the researchers dress for a full shift of hard labor and motor into shore. Out on the lake, crowded onto the small platform of the coring raft, Bakke and his Norwegian team sinks one of the long brown tubes through the drilling gap and into around 85 feet of water, lowering it until it touches the bottom. For the next four hours, they do hundreds of squats, hauling up and then dropping down a heavy piston, driving the pipe vertically into the mud, grit, sand, and gravel of the lake bed. A five-foot sample usually takes a couple of hours of this ab-crunching workout. The pipe can provide a core of up to 20 feet. “It’s not very sophisticated, but it works,” says Bradley.The scientists, after coming all this way and going through so many hazards, are determined to pull as long—and ancient—a core as possible from the lake. They work for six hours. On shore, D’Andrea and another researcher have been cataloging the jumbled landscape of bowling ball-size rocks between the 1,600-foot glacier two miles away and the shore of the lake. They collect baggies of sediment and take water samples and GPS elevation readings.After working from midnight to noon, the rig team has pulled a long core and a short core, and the land team has completed its exploration and measurements. Meeting back at the gravel beach, the fatigued expedition members begin the exhausting job of undoing all their work and heading back to the boat.Finished after three more hours, the scientists know they have two and a half more days at sea, four lakes, and many more repetitions of the coring process ahead of them. Although they cannot foresee the the big storm waiting for them, what they all know is that the danger and exhaustion is worth every moment of exploration and discovery. The data’s value makes the hazards worthwhile.“There are certain aspects of science where people have to risk themselves to do it,” says Bradley. “In the end you have to take those risks if you're going to get the information.”See more of John Wendle’s work at johnwendle.com, instagram.com/johnwendle and vimeo.com/johnwendle.",
"Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill covered Alabama's Orange Beach in 2010.The largest oil spill in U.S. history was even bigger than previously thought, at least in terms of the amount of coastline that was oiled, scientists report in a new study. The findings shed new light onto the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which began six years ago Wednesday.Scientists from the federal government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and several private research companies found oil along 1,313 miles (2,113 kilometers) out of 5,930 miles (9,545 kilometers) of surveyed shoreline after the spill, an increase of 19 percent from previously published estimates. That makes the disaster the largest marine oil spill in history by length of shoreline oiled, the team reported in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin.The spill released millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf over 87 days, from April 20 to July 15, 2010, in a dramatic event that shocked the world. Some of the oil was recovered, burned, or dispersed at sea, while some washed up on the shorelines of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas.To estimate the complete extent of the oil's reach, the scientists pored over all the available ground-based data on the area, including recent data from cleanup efforts. The team members hope their work will provide a more clear picture of the spill and help managers better predict and understand future accidents.The scientists found the majority of the oiling in Louisiana, with significant oiling in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and, to a lesser extent, Texas.The team also found that the oiled shoreline was roughly evenly split between beaches (46 percent) and coastal wetlands (52 percent), with the remaining 2 percent being all other shoreline types. Most of the wetlands were in Louisiana.The behavior of that oil in the shoreline environment has been complex, the team adds. Some was removed or treated by cleanup crews, some degraded naturally, some soaked into the soil, and some remains at the surface. Additional oil was also deposited months after the initial spill, due to the drifting of currents.Environmentalists have argued that all that oil has had a lasting impact on the Gulf, even as initial fears of mass die-offs didn't materialize."The impacts on dolphins, sea turtles, and many other species are still being felt today," Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, says in a statement this week.The National Wildlife Federation says more than three-quarters of pregnant bottlenose dolphins in the oiled areas failed to give birth to a viable calf in the years since the disaster. Between two and five trillion larval fish and 8.3 billion oysters are estimated to have been lost, resulting in a substantial impact to the region's fishery. Threatened gulf sturgeon and Bryde's whales are also thought to have been harmed.About 30 percent of the oil thought to have been spilled is still unaccounted for, with the industry hotly debating the issue with conservationists. Some scientists think it must have sunk to the ocean bottom, where it may be harming communities there, but efforts to find it have proven elusive.BP finalized a $20.8 billion settlement last October in response to the spill, representing the largest pollution penalty in U.S. history.Follow Brian Clark Howard on Twitter and Google+.",
"Their  faces obscured by breathing masks, workers pore over data in the  control room for the now-ruined Unit 1 and Unit 2 reactors at Japan's Fukushima  Daiichi nuclear power plant on Wednesday.Although  some power has now been restored to the facility, the workers known as  the Fukushima 50 face a difficult job getting pumps and circuits to  operate the crucial systems that provide cooling for the reactors and  the spent fuel stored on site.The  photos released by Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency are the  first look inside the plant since the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami that flooded the facility and crippled the backup  generators needed to cool the radioactive fuel.(Related: "Would a New Nuclear Plant Fare Better than Fukushima?")—Marianne Lavelle",
"Homes in Seaside Heights, New Jersey sit in ruins on the Atlantic Ocean waterfront after being destroyed by Hurricane Sandy on October 31, 2012. At least 147 people were reportedly killed by Sandy, and New Jersey suffered massive damage and power outages.A “raging freak of nature” is how National Geographic described Hurricane Sandy when it hit land in fall 2012.From beginning to end, Hurricane Sandy's progression caused deadly flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds from the Caribbean to the U.S. East Coast. An unusual combination of hurricane conditions and cold fronts made Sandy particularly potent. In the nine days that Sandy raged, it killed 70 people in the Caribbean and almost 150 people in the U.S.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates Sandy caused at least $70 billion in damages, making it among the costliest storms in U.S. history.Though Sandy is often described as an anomaly, for many it was a call to action. The disaster showed how vulnerable wider areas of the United States are to extreme weather events, particularly in a time when scientists warn that climate change is threatening sea-level rise and hotter temperatures. Since the storm, affected regions have rethought their disaster plans to try and increase their preparedness.On October 22, 2012, a tropical depression formed off the northeast coast of Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea. Two days later, it strengthened and officially became a Category 1 hurricane as it moved northeast. Hurricane Sandy passed over Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.It pummeled Haiti with rain, setting off a torrent of mudslides that killed at least 50 people. By October 26, it had passed over Puerto Rico and Cuba, damaging the historic city of Santiago de Cuba.Over the next few days, Hurricane Sandy continued north. It weakened to a tropical depression once reaching the Bahamas on October 27, but then it quickly restrengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. NOAA reports that this reformed structure was unusual and was spurred by warm waters. The tempest became huge, with a radius that stretched 100 miles.The wide-reaching storm progressed up the U.S. East Coast. It stayed several hundred miles offshore when passing the Carolinas, but it still pushed large waves and massive amounts of rain ashore. Roads were washed away in the Outer Banks.Sandy moved past Delaware and New Jersey, unleashing more havoc as it collided with a cold front heading east toward the Atlantic. A separate high-pressure storm to the north of Sandy prevented it from moving away from shore, effectively trapping the now combined storm systems along the coast. Sandy's winds now extended 1,000 miles along the coast.Because it became a hybrid of two storm systems and grew to be so immense, the press dubbed Sandy a Frankenstorm at the time.A full moon added to the deadly storm surge that resulted, which increased the tide pushed ashore by a foot.As the tropical storm system mixed with cooler air, it lost its hurricane structure but retained its intense winds. It was ultimately dubbed a superstorm, an unofficial designation given to large storms that don't easily fit into a single classification.As the superstorm hit the coasts of New Jersey and New York, it packed a wallop. Parts of New York City near lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island flooded, temporarily paralyzing the city's subway system. As it progressed Sandy dropped a deluge of snow in the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina.Over 8 million people lost power during the story, and outages were seen for days in some major cities, while outlying areas were without power for weeks. Power outages from Sandy were experienced as far west as Michigan.On October 30, the storm began to weaken as it moved inland before finally dissipating the next day over Pennsylvania. Even as the remains of Sandy moved west of Pittsburgh, the tempest's immense size continued to push storm surges toward New York and cause additional flooding. At its maximum size the storm covered a quarter of the continental U.S.Two years after Sandy, experts broke down why the storm was so deadly. All but one European weather model had predicted the storm would turn and travel out to sea instead of striking the U.S. Just before the storm hit, the National Hurricane Center put local weather offices in charge of issuing advisories. Many people chose not to evacuate.Many homes along the East Coast were destroyed, with parts of the Jersey Shore and Staten Island particularly impacted. As long as five years after, some residents were still rebuilding, with many relocating to higher ground. Thousands of people were temporarily left homeless, and more than 20,000 households were displaced a year after the storm hit.Though the storm itself wasn't as strong as other infamous hurricanes, a combination of weather factors and the fact that much of the region was unprepared for it contributed to high levels of damage.Sandy is considered the fourth most expensive storm in U.S. history, and more than 600,000 housing units were destroyed in New Jersey and New York. The government of New York City estimates that $19 billion in damage was inflicted on the city alone. Five years after Sandy, more than a thousand New Jersey residents reported still being unable to return home.A report published by the city of New York outlines where the region was vulnerable to a storm the size of Sandy. It found that while some infrastructure like flood walls was out-of-date, the city also did not have sufficient plans in place to deal with the disaster. Most businesses and homeowners in New York City did not have flood insurance, having never suspected a storm the size of Sandy could reach so far north.As a result, Hurricane Sandy served as a wakeup call for many in the region.In addition to providing state funding to help struggling people rebuild their homes, New York and New Jersey also invested in rebuilding their outdated infrastructure meant to prevent flooding. Even in 2019, some East Coast cities are still pushing for additional funding to rebuild dunes and barriers destroyed by Sandy.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at the time that his state's infrastructure needed to be rethought, not just rebuilt. Climate experts predict that extreme weather events like Sandy will become more common as the planet warms, warning that leaders need to both prepare for a more uncertain world and work to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.",
"Normal, simple houses designed to be at ground level take on a whole different look up in the air.After Superstorm Sandy slammed into the New Jersey shore in 2012, people whose houses were still standing began having them raised—lifted on temporary pilings so that permanent foundations could be put in. Some did it to meet new construction codes or to reduce their flood insurance rates. But for others, I think, it was just a heartfelt bid to stay where they had sunk their roots, no matter the surroundings.On Paul Jones Drive in Brick Township, New Jersey, a large home sits on a dozen supports.On Bay Point Drive in Toms River, New Jersey, the garage is open but unreachable.At the corner of Kingfisher Way and Grand Central Avenue in Lavallette, New Jersey, a house with blue siding towers over its neighbors.On Mizzen Road in Toms River, New Jersey, a classic colonial still has one topiary-style planting.For 25 years I’ve vacationed with my family at the Jersey Shore, where beach communities are strung along 127 miles of coastline. In 2013 I began taking photos to capture the groundswell of house raisings and the strangeness of what it all looks like. We tend to think of buildings as fairly permanent—but when you see how a house can be dug underneath, lifted up, moved around, pulled, and tossed, it challenges that view.Some homes had little Sandy damage; many had a lot. Raising a house can add as much as $150,000 to repair costs and prolong the disruption that homeowners already have endured.Working on this photo project has made me question the wisdom of what we’re doing. We keep rebuilding after events like Sandy—despite scientists’ warnings that in the future, climate change could make sea-level rise and extreme weather even worse. We haven’t wrestled with the bigger question of whether some locations simply are no longer safe or practical for habitation.When big storms hit, we see dramatic pictures in real time, and they tug at us. What happens later gets less attention but is no less important: It’s the dirty, determined work of reclaiming a place and rising from the rubble.",
"Oil sands facilities like this one in Canada contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than crude oil production. If governements are to avoid a climate catastrophe, renewable and carbon-free power sources will need to replace oil by mid century, a new report says.The majority of the carbon emission reduction pledges for 2030 that 184 countries made under the Paris Agreement aren’t nearly enough to keep global warming well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). Some countries won’t achieve their pledges, and some of the world's largest carbon emitters will continue to increase their emissions, according to a panel of world-class climate scientists.Their report, “The Truth Behind the Paris Agreement Climate Pledges,” warns that by 2030, the failure to reduce emissions will cost the world a minimum of $2 billion per day in economic losses from weather events made worse by human-induced climate change. Moreover, weather events and patterns will hurt human health, livelihoods, food, and water, as well as biodiversity.On Monday, November 4, the Trump Administration submitted a formal request to officially pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement next November. Every nation in the world has agreed “to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change,” according to language in the pact.“Countries need to double and triple their 2030 reduction commitments to be aligned with the Paris target,” says Sir Robert Watson, former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and co-author of the report that closely examined the 184 voluntary pledges under the Paris Agreement.“We have the technology and knowledge to make those emissions cuts, but what’s missing are strong enough policies and regulations to make it happen,” Watson says in an interview. “Right now the world is on a pathway to between 3 and 4 degrees C (5.5 and 7F) by the end of the century.”That pathway risks triggering natural feedbacks such as massive thawing of permafrost or widespread forest die-offs, which could lead to additional uncontrollable warming. Scientists have called this the Hothouse Earth scenario, where sea levels rise 30 to 200 feet (10 to 60 meters) and large parts of the planet become uninhabitable.Changing that future requires reaching the Paris Agreement climate target of well below 2 degrees C. Global emissions need to be halved by next decade and net-zero by mid century, says energy economist Nebojsa Nakicenovic, former CEO of the International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IIASA) in Austria.However, the report’s analysis of the 184 pledges for 2030 found that almost 75 percent were insufficient. In fact, the world’s first and fourth biggest emitters, China and India, will have higher emissions in 2030. The U.S. is the second largest and its pledge is too low. It’s also in doubt, given the Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the accord.Russia, the fifth largest emitter, hasn’t even bothered to make a pledge. Only the European Union, the third largest emitter, pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030 and is expected to reach a near 60 percent reduction.The beauty of this report is that it very easy to see which countries are leading and which are lagging, says Watson. “We’re already experiencing big impacts from climate change. Waiting to act just locks us into higher temperatures and worsening impacts,” he says.(See a report card on which countries are reaching their climate targets.)The report is published by the Universal Ecological Fund, a nonprofit that focuses on providing accessible information on climate science in the hopes of inspiring people to push for climate action.It provides “yet another solid piece of science-based evidence to justify” calls by the public for greater action by governments and businesses, says climate scientist Bill Hare of Berlin-based Climate Analytics. Hare wasn’t involved in the report but is a contributor to the Climate Action Tracker, which does scientific analysis of pledges and climate policies.Hare notes that poorer nations cannot make deep emission cuts without the long-promised funding and technical support promised by the world’s rich nations. Watson agrees, saying industrialized nations have largely caused the climate problem and must support less-developed countries. “We need everyone on board to solve this,” he says.All countries need to step up, accept that global emissions must reach net zero by 2050 and take very large steps to make it happen, says Niklas Höhne of the NewClimate Institute for Climate Policy and Global Sustainability in Germany.Stepping up means major improvements in energy efficiency, while closing 2,400 coal plants and replacing them with renewables within the next decade. This is not only possible; it would be cost-effective. But 250 new coal power plants are under construction around the world, the report found."Leaders need to adopt new policies to close coal-fired power plants and promote renewable and carbon-free power sources,” says James McCarthy, professor of oceanography at Harvard University.Current government efforts will not substantially slow climate change, McCarthy says in a statement.This widespread failure to act on the existential threat posed by climate change has prompted more than 11,000 scientists from 153 countries to sign a “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” declaration. Published independently of the climate pledge report, the declaration begins: “Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and ‘tell it like it is.’”Published today as a paper in the journal Bioscience, it includes six critical steps to lessen the worst impacts of climate change and 29 “vital signs” to track progress. These vital signs are in the form of graphs that document various human activities over the last 40 years that have contributed to climate change, such as energy consumption, deforestation, and air transportation. The graphs also include the resulting climate impacts, such as rising levels of CO2 and sea ice loss.Avoiding “untold human suffering" requires an immense increase in the scale of emissions reductions, the declaration warns. That includes reducing meat consumption and food waste, as well as massively increasing energy efficiency through renewable energy.The climate solutions in the paper aren’t new, acknowledges lead author William Ripple of Oregon State University. But by listing the solutions as a set of six crucial steps, along with “simple graphical indicators showing where we were 40 years ago and how things have changed,” the authors hope these will be easily understood by anyone, says Ripple.“Citizens everywhere need to become more politically involved and policymakers need to make dramatic improvements in their climate action plans,” he says.The public is becoming more involved; millions participated in September’s global climate strikes. Many countries, states, and provinces, cities, and businesses are responding to those demands for increased action on climate, he says.The 2020 U.S. election will be about climate change, Ripple says. “It already is.”“Abandoning the Paris Agreement is cruel to future generations,” says Andrew Steer, President & CEO of the World Resources Institute about the Trump Administration’s move to officially pull the U.S. out of the agreement. The U.S. will lose out on the jobs and much stronger economy that a low-carbon future will bring, Steer says in a statement.The Trump Administration is sending the world “a catastrophic message in a moment of great urgency,” says May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org, a large grassroots activist group. “…a majority of people in the United States understand the need to address this crisis head on,” Boeve says in a statement.An August 2019 poll found that 71 percent of U.S. voters want the federal government to do more to address climate change. A similar majority believe it will have a positive impact on the economy and jobs.A year from now—Nov 4, 2020—the U.S. will be officially out of the Paris Agreement. That is one day after the presidential election. The U.S. could re-enter the pact within 30 days of a request to the United Nations.",
"Sergey Zimov, an ecologist by training, tossed a woolly mammoth bone on the pile. He was squatting in mud along the cool, wide Kolyma River, below a towering cliff of crumbling earth. It was summer in eastern Siberia, far above the Arctic Circle, in that part of Russia that’s closer to Alaska than to Moscow. There wasn’t a speck of frost or snow in sight. Yet at this cliff, called Duvanny Yar, the Kolyma had chewed through and exposed what lies beneath: a layer of frozen ground, or permafrost, that is hundreds of feet deep—and warming fast.Twigs, other plant matter, and Ice Age animal parts—bison jaws, horse femurs, mammoth bones—spilled onto a beach that sucked at Zimov’s boots. “I love Duvanny Yar,” he said as he yanked fossils from the muck. “It is like a book. Each page is a story about the history of nature.”Across nine million square miles at the top of the planet, climate change is writing a new chapter. Arctic permafrost isn’t thawing gradually, as scientists once predicted. Geologically speaking, it’s thawing almost overnight. As soils like the ones at Duvanny Yar soften and slump, they’re releasing vestiges of ancient life—and masses of carbon—that have been locked in frozen dirt for millennia. Entering the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide, the carbon promises to accelerate climate change, even as humans struggle to curb our fossil fuel emissions.Few understand this threat better than Zimov. From a ramshackle research station in the gold-mining outpost of Cherskiy, about three hours by speedboat from Duvanny Yar, he has spent decades unearthing the mysteries of a warming Arctic. Along the way, he has helped upend conventional wisdom—especially the notion that the far north, back in the Pleistocene ice ages, had been an unbroken desert of ice and thin soils dotted with sage.Instead, the abundant fossils of mammoths and other large grazers at Duvanny Yar and other sites told Zimov that Siberia, Alaska, and western Canada had been fertile grasslands, rich with herbs and willows. As these plants and animals died, the cold slowed their decomposition. Over time, windblown silt buried them deep, locking them in permafrost. The upshot is that Arctic permafrost is much richer in carbon than scientists once thought.Now new discoveries suggest that the carbon will escape faster as the planet warms. From the unexpected speed of Arctic warming and the troubling ways that meltwater moves through polar landscapes, researchers now suspect that for every one degree Celsius rise in Earth’s average temperature, permafrost may release the equivalent of four to six years’ worth of coal, oil, and natural gas emissions—double to triple what scientists thought a few years ago. Within a few decades, if we don’t curb fossil fuel use, permafrost could be as big a source of greenhouse gases as China, the world’s largest emitter, is today.We aren’t accounting for that. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has only recently started incorporating permafrost into its projections. It still underestimates just how wide Pandora’s freezer could swing open—and how much havoc that could unleash.Permafrost’s potential to warm the planet is dwarfed by our own. But if we hope to limit warming to two degrees Celsius, as 195 nations agreed to during the 2015 Paris talks, new research suggests we may have to cut emissions eight years sooner than IPCC models project, just to account for the thawing that will be going on.It is perhaps our least appreciated reason to hasten a transition to cleaner energy: To reach whatever goal we set to combat warming, we’ll need to move even faster than we think.Zimov first came to Cherskiy in the 1970s as a college student to help with mapping on an expedition. He loved the stark landscape and isolation and remoteness from Soviet power centers. The dark winters promised time to think. He returned a few years later and founded the Northeast Science Station, at first under the auspices of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Today he owns and runs it with his son, Nikita. It’s an improvisational operation run on a shoestring and on secondhand equipment. But the station attracts Arctic scientists from around the world.One day in the summer of 2018, photographer Katie Orlinsky and I joined Zimov in an aging boat to ferry supplies to a carbon-monitoring facility at Ambarchik Bay, near the mouth of the Kolyma on the Arctic Ocean. The site had originally been occupied by a transit station for prisoners bound for Stalin’s gulags, and Soviet-era relics were everywhere. We traversed spongy grasses across a walkway fashioned from a string of old steam radiators. Zimov, bull chested, his long white hair tucked in a beret, probed the ground with a metal shaft as he walked. He’s been doing that a lot lately, to check the depth of the hard permafrost.Permafrost—ground that remains frozen year-round—is capped by a few feet of dirt and plant detritus. Called the active layer, this soil normally thaws each summer and refreezes in winter, protecting permafrost from rising heat above. But in the spring of 2018, a crew working for Nikita found that dirt near the surface around Cherskiy had not iced up at all during the long dark polar night. That was unheard of: January in Siberia is so brutally cold that human breath can freeze with a tinkling sound that the indigenous Yakuts call “the whisper of stars.” The Soviets used to land heavy planes on the Kolyma. Soil 30 inches down should have been frozen. Instead it was mush.“Three years ago, the temperature in the ground above our permafrost was minus 3 degrees Celsius [27 degrees Fahrenheit],” Sergey Zimov said. “Then it was minus 2. Then it was minus one. This year, the temperature was plus 2 degrees.”On one level that’s not surprising. Earth’s five warmest years since the late 19th century have come since 2014, and the Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet, as it loses the sea ice that helps chill it. In 2017 tundra in Greenland faced its worst known wildfire. Days before we landed in Siberia, thermometers in Lakselv, Norway, 240 miles above the Arctic Circle, recorded a blistering 32 degrees Celsius, or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Arctic reindeer hid in road tunnels for relief.Permafrost temperatures globally have been rising for half a century. On Alaska’s North Slope, they spiked 11 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 years. Localized thawing of permafrost, especially in villages where development disturbs the surface and allows heat to penetrate, has eroded shorelines, undermined roads and schools, cracked pipelines, and collapsed ice cellars where Arctic hunters store walrus meat and bowhead whale blubber. Warm summers are already warping life for Arctic residents.What the Zimovs were documenting in 2018, though, was something different, with implications beyond the Arctic: a wintertime thaw. The culprit, paradoxically, was heavy snow. Siberia is dry, but for several winters before 2018, thick snow had smothered the region. The snow acted like a blanket, trapping summer heat in the soil. At a research site 11 miles from Cherskiy, Mathias Goeckede of Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry found that snow depth had doubled in five years. By April 2018 temperatures in the active layer had risen 10 degrees Fahrenheit.The phenomenon wasn’t limited to Siberia. Vladimir Romanovsky, a permafrost expert at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, had for years watched the active layer freeze completely by mid-January at some 180 research sites in Alaska. But as those places also faced a recent period with heavy snow, the freezing slipped first to February, then to March. In 2018, eight of Romanovsky’s sites near Fairbanks and a dozen on the Seward Peninsula, in western Alaska, never fully froze at all.Globally, permafrost holds up to 1,600 gigatons of carbon, nearly twice what’s in the atmosphere. No one expects all or even most of that to thaw. Until recently, researchers presumed permafrost would lose at most 10 percent of its carbon. Even that, it was thought, could take as much as 80 years.But when the active layer stops freezing in winter, things speed up. The added warmth lets microbes chomp organic material in the soil—and emit carbon dioxide or methane—year-round, instead of for just a few short months each summer. And the winter warmth spreads down into the permafrost itself, thawing it faster.“A lot of our assumptions are breaking down,” said Róisín Commane, an atmospheric chemist at Columbia University who tracks carbon emissions by airplane. She and her colleagues have discovered that the amount of CO2 coming off Alaska’s North Slope in early winter has increased by 73 percent since 1975. “We’ve been trying to understand what’s going on in the Arctic by relying on summer,” Commane said. “But after the sun goes down—that’s when the real story begins.”A few snowy winters don’t make a trend; this past winter there was less snow in Cherskiy, and the soil cooled again considerably. Fairbanks also got little snow. Yet at some of Romanovsky’s sites in Alaska, the active layer again retained enough heat to keep from completely freezing.“This is truly amazing,” said Max Holmes, deputy director of Massachusetts’s Woods Hole Research Center, who has studied the carbon cycle in both Alaska and Cherskiy. “I’ve largely imagined permafrost thaw as a slow and steady process, and maybe this is an odd five-year period. But what if it’s not? What if things change much more quickly?”The Zimovs believe that large grazing animals helped maintain rich Arctic grasslands during the Ice Age, in part by fertilizing the grass. In hopes of bringing back the dry steppe—and also slowing permafrost thaw—they are now importing wild horses and other grazers to a site along a tributary of the Kolyma River. They call it Pleistocene Park.And what if the change becomes self-reinforcing—as it already is, for example, in the case of Arctic sea ice? Sea ice reflects the sun’s rays, keeping the ocean below it cold. But as sea ice melts, the dark ocean absorbs that heat, which then melts more ice.As a rule, the tipping points at which such feedback loops kick in are tricky to predict. “We know there are thresholds we don’t want to cross,” said Chris Field, director of Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment. “But we don’t know precisely where they are.”With permafrost, there’s just too much we can’t see. It covers an area more than twice the size of the United States, inhabited by half as many people as New York City, in some of the world’s least accessible terrain. Little of it is monitored directly. Scientists instead study small plots, track others remotely, and draw inferences about the rest—unlike Arctic sea ice, which can be measured in its entirety by satellite. “You can go online and track exactly what happened to sea ice,” said permafrost expert Ted Schuur of Northern Arizona University. “With permafrost, we’re barely looking. We barely have the tools to measure what’s happening.”One type of permafrost has researchers particularly concerned: the 20 percent or so that contains immense deposits of solid ice. Some of that ice formed when water percolated down through soils and froze as it hit permafrost; some was created over thousands of years during Arctic winters, when the ground contracted and cracked into polygonal patterns. In spring, meltwater filled those crevices, which later refroze. Over time the buried ice grew into massive wedges enveloped by permafrost soil. Duvanny Yar is shot through with them.Such a structure can unravel swiftly. When permafrost disintegrates, buried ice melts too. As water drains, it transports heat that spreads the thawing, and it leaves behind tunnels and air pockets. The ground sinks to fill those cavities, creating surface depressions that fill with rain and meltwater. The water deepens the pools and chews through their icy banks, until puddles grow to ponds and ponds become lakes. That causes more ground to warm and more ice to melt.“Abrupt thaw,” as scientists call this process, changes the whole landscape. It triggers landslides; on Banks Island in Canada, scientists documented a 60-fold increase in massive ground slumps from 1984 to 2013. It topples forests. Merritt Turetsky, an ecologist with Canada’s University of Guelph, has tracked abrupt thaw in a black spruce forest near Fairbanks for the past 15 years. Flooding there, she has found, is destabilizing tree roots and trunks. Turetsky suspects all the trees in her “drunken forest” will tip over soon and get swallowed by new wetlands. “There are still little pockets of land, but you have to wade through some pretty wet spots to reach them,” she said.The crumbling permafrost cliffs at Newtok, Alaska, on the Ninglick River near the Bering Sea, are now within a few dozen feet of some homes. The village is moving to a new site nine miles upriver—pioneering a process that many Alaskan villages may one day undergo.All permafrost thaw leads to greenhouse gas emissions. But standing water accelerates the threat. The gas that bubbles from the oxygen-deprived mud under ponds and lakes is not only carbon dioxide but also methane, which is 25 times as potent a greenhouse gas as CO2. Ecologist Katey Walter Anthony of the University of Alaska Fairbanks has been measuring the methane coming from Arctic lakes for two decades. Her latest calculations, published in 2018, suggest that new lakes created by abrupt thaw could nearly triple the greenhouse gas emissions expected from permafrost.It’s not clear how much of this message has reached policymakers. Last October the IPCC unveiled a new report on the more ambitious of two temperature goals adopted at the 2015 Paris conference. The planet already has warmed by about one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th century. Capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius rather than two degrees, the report said, would expose 420 million fewer people to frequent extreme heat waves, and it would halve the number of plants and animals facing habitat loss. It also might save some coral reefs—and as much as 770,000 square miles of permafrost. But to achieve the 1.5-degree goal, according to the IPCC, the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions 45 percent by 2030, eliminate them completely by 2050, and develop technologies to suck huge quantities back out of the atmosphere.The challenge may be even starker. The 1.5-degree report was the first time the IPCC had taken permafrost emissions into account—but it didn’t include emissions from abrupt thaw. Climate models aren’t yet sophisticated enough to capture that kind of rapid landscape change. But at National Geographic’s request, Katey Walter Anthony and Charles Koven, a modeler at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, made rough calculations that do add in emissions from abrupt thaw. To halt temperature rise at 1.5 degrees, they estimate, we’d have to zero out our own fossil fuel emissions at least 20 percent sooner—no later than 2044, six years ahead of the IPCC timetable. That would give us just a quarter century to completely transform the global energy system.“We’re facing this unknown future with an incomplete set of tools,” Koven said. “The uncertainty isn’t all on our side. There are a lot of ways things could turn out worse.” There’s more than one way to make new lakes, for example.The village of Newtok, population 380, is sinking as the permafrost beneath it thaws. On a summer bird hunt, four Yupik boys—from left, Kenyon Kassaiuli, Jonah Andy, Larry Charles, and Reese John—cross a flooded walkway.A few weeks after leaving Siberia, Orlinsky and I took a raft trip through Alaska’s Gates of the Arctic National Park with ecologist Ken Tape, a colleague of Walter Anthony’s at the University of Alaska. A floatplane dropped us and river guide Michael Wald at Gaedeke Lake, in the central Brooks Range. From there we made our way south down the Alatna River. September sun danced on the water. Within a mile or so we found chewed sticks along the bank. We’d been on the river a week when we arrived at a 38-acre lake that hadn’t been there before. At its center was an enormous beaver lodge.Tape has been using aerial and satellite photographs for years to track how plants and wildlife are changing in Alaska—and how that might affect permafrost. As permafrost thaws and the growing seasons lengthen, the Arctic is greening: Shrubs in Alaska river plains, for example, have nearly doubled in size. (While vegetation growth will take up more carbon, a 2016 survey of experts concluded that Arctic greening won’t be nearly enough to offset permafrost thaw.) The vegetation is drawing animals north.With willows now tall enough to poke through snow, snowshoe hares can find winter food and hiding spots all the way to the Arctic Ocean. Typically forest dwellers, they’ve now colonized Alaska’s North Slope, hundreds of miles from any real forest. Lynx, which prey on hares, appear to have followed. Both are probably traveling a trail blazed by moose, which also eat willows and now number roughly 1,600 along the Colville River, where they were absent before.Those discoveries led Tape to search photographs for other tundra newcomers. “As soon as I thought about beavers, I seized on it,” he said. “Very few species leave a mark so visible that you can see it from space.”In images from 1999 to 2014, covering just three watersheds, he spotted 56 new beaver pond complexes that hadn’t been there in the 1980s. The animals are colonizing northern Alaska in earnest, moving at about five miles per year. Tape believes there are now up to 800 beaver pond complexes in Arctic Alaska, including the one with the massive lodge on the Alatna. Tape dubbed it Lodge Mahal.It was quite a sight: a mound of branches and saplings, about eight feet high by 35 feet across, plastered with mud and moss and sitting in a waist-high lake surrounded by marsh. The water had been diverted from the river by a series of dams. “That entire swamp around Lodge Mahal is new,” Tape said. “If you went back 50 years, there’d be zero beavers here.”Tape and Wald had wanted to explore the Alatna in part because a guide who works for Wald had earlier found beaver-chewed wood along the Nigu River. The Nigu starts near Gaedeke Lake, the Alatna headwaters, but on the other side of the Continental Divide—and so it flows north into the Colville River and the Arctic Ocean. Along the Alatna, above Lodge Mahal, we found other ponds and abandoned dams. Tape now thinks that beavers are on their way to the North Slope, and that they’re using the Alatna as a route through the Brooks Range. “We’re seeing this expansion in real time,” he said.He can’t prove that climate change is driving it; the beaver population also has been rebounding since the end of the fur trade, a century and a half ago. But in any case, the bucktoothed engineers could significantly remake permafrost landscapes. “Imagine if you were a developer and you said, I’d like permission to put three dams on every other stream in the Arctic tundra,” Tape said. “That’s what this could be like.”Tape has seen a preview. Southeast of Shishmaref, on Alaska’s Seward Peninsula, photos of a tributary of the Serpentine River show no change at all between 1950 and 1985. By 2002 beavers had moved in and flooded the landscape. By 2012 some ground had collapsed and become wetlands. Permafrost was on its way out.A few hundred beavers won’t reengineer the Arctic. But the animals may be heading north in Canada and Siberia too, and they reproduce quickly. Argentina’s experience is instructive: Twenty beavers were deliberately introduced in the south in 1946 in order to foster a fur trade. Today that population hovers around 100,000.In the Zimovs’ vision of the past and future of Arctic permafrost, wild animals also play a central role—but the beasts are bigger than beavers, and their effect on permafrost more benevolent. The herds of bison, mammoths, horses, and reindeer that lumbered across the Pleistocene steppes, Sergey Zimov has long argued, did more than just eat the grass. They maintained it. They fertilized it with their waste and packed it down, trampling mosses and shrubs and ripping out tree saplings.Since the last ice age, those dry, rich grasslands have been replaced in eastern Siberia by damp tundra, dominated by mosses in the north and forests farther south. One key driver of that change, according to Zimov, was human hunters who decimated the herds of large grazers, by about 10,000 years ago. Without grazers to fertilize the soil, grasses withered; without grasses to soak up water, the soil got wetter. Mosses and trees took over. But if humans hadn’t pushed the ecosystem beyond a tipping point thousands of years ago, there would still be mammoths grazing in Siberia.Almost 25 years ago, on lowlands near Cherskiy, Zimov created a 56-square-mile demonstration project called Pleistocene Park. His idea was to bring large grazers back and see whether they would bring back the grasslands. He and, eventually, Nikita fenced in wild horses and later trucked in yaks and sheep from Lake Baikal. This past spring Nikita hauled in 12 bison from Denmark, traveling 9,000 miles across Russia by truck and barge. In 2018 the Zimovs joined forces with Harvard University geneticist George Church, who thinks he essentially can clone a mammoth. The hope is that one day those now extinct beasts will be stomping around Pleistocene Park, thriving in the Anthropocene.This permafrost cellar in the whaling community of Kaktovik, had been used for generations, but flooding has ruined it.Chunks of whale meat sit at the bottom of an ice cellar in Utqiaġvik (Barrow). Even when a cellar doesn’t flood, warming temperatures may render it useless.The park is the ultimate test of Sergey Zimov’s hypothesis—and, he hopes, a hedge against future climate change. Grasslands, especially when snow covered, reflect more sunlight than does dark forest. Grazing animals tamp down deep snow, allowing heat to escape the soil. Both things cool the land. If wildlife could restore grasslands, it would slow permafrost thaw and thus climate change. To make a real difference, though, you’d need to unleash thousands of zoos’ worth of animals across millions of acres of the Arctic.The Zimovs say the evidence from their 36,000-acre park is promising. Even with only about a hundred animals, the park’s grasslands stay substantially cooler than the ground in the surrounding area.The gap between the Zimovs’ ambitions and the reality of the park is unquestionably large. During a tour one afternoon, Orlinsky and I hiked soggy grasses to a stretch of marsh to watch the horses. A lone bison hid in the distance. Nikita loaded us onto an eight-wheel mini-tank and took us crashing through the willows. After a steep climb we plowed over some skinny larches. This is why he needs giant herbivores, Nikita said: “At the moment I don’t have any animals which can kill those trees.” He spends a lot of time raising funds, most recently in California, hobnobbing with the likes of former Governor Jerry Brown, just to keep this proof of concept going.Flora Aiken processes a seal her uncle killed near Utqiaġvik (Barrow). As climate change and modernization undermine Inupiat hunting and fishing practices, more women are engaging in them to help keep traditions alive.The concept has its critics. Some scientists dispute the Zimovs’ estimates of how many large animals were roaming around Siberia in the Pleistocene, or insist that their theory of ecological change, both past and present, is too simplistic. Above all, most criticism seems leveled at the Zimovs’ audacity. Max Holmes of Woods Hole, who knows them well, sees a spark of genius in their work. The Zimovs are “at the fringe,” Holmes said, “but that’s often where big ideas and big changes originate.”Outside Pleistocene Park, the modern world has responded to the warming Arctic with complacency. We’ve spent decades ignoring the evidence of climate change and hoping that things won’t get too bad. We count on technological advances that seem always just out of reach. And we do this in spite of the fact that climate scientists—permafrost experts in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and even audacious action.The Zimovs are different: They’ve spent their lives battling an unforgiving landscape that rewards bullheadedness. Is trying to save permafrost by restoring the Arctic steppe, they ask, really so much crazier than counting on humans to quickly retool the world’s energy system? Maybe we need a little craziness.“Fighting climate change needs multiple actions from multiple different fronts,” Nikita said. Only if we combine them all can we make the future “not entirely miserable.”",
"The Anthropocene. That’s the name that is starting to be used to describe the current epoch of Earth’s history. The “anthro,” of course, refers to how people have altered the planet. The dire effects of human activity—climate change and pollution, to name a couple—are well-known.But we are also learning how to make the planet a better place, as the examples here demonstrate. Advances in technology have enabled people to farm more efficiently, reclaim water more effectively, and replenish distressed land. In his “Anthropocene” series, photographer David Ellingsen combines relics of the human and natural worlds. The works reflect both hope and concern about how our species is remaking the planet.1.

"Every year, about 15 billion trees are cut down to make way for agriculture, mining, logging, and urban sprawl. Such mass deforestation has accelerated global warming and imperiled the survival of millions of species. Though many nations, organizations, and even individuals have tried, no one has been able to plant enough trees to make up for that loss—but some innovative entrepreneurs are working on a high-tech solution.BioCarbon Engineering (BCE), a U.K.-based start-up, has developed a technique that they say could potentially plant one billion trees per year. The method? Drones.Current tree-planting programs "are just not fast enough,” said Irina Fedorenko, a co-founder of the company. “But our technology is automated, so we can scale up quite realistically and quite quickly.” (Learn about the teenager who is on track to plant a trillion trees.)Trees are critical to absorbing the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Without them, the speed and severity of climate change will continue to escalate. But for their part, BCE has dubbed their strategy “industrial-scale reforestation.”First, a drone scans the terrain and develops a 3-D map of the area. Then, using the data from this “smart map,” the team develops an algorithm for a unique planting pattern. A “firing drone” uses the algorithm to carry out the planting strategy. The drone flies about six feet above the ground, firing germinated seed pods at a speed that will get them under the soil. One drone operator can manage six drones.It’s similar to strategies used for precision farming, except in this case, the firing drones take the place of tractors—“sky tractors,” as Fedorenko refers to them.The system’s designers say their technique is much more efficient and accurate than regular aerial seeding methods. Initial testing in the U.K. found that the species planted by drone had a better survival rate than helicopter spreading that's more commonly used. Some species even had survival rates nearly identical to hand planting.“We are bridging this gap between ground-based technologies like tractors and aerial technologies such as helicopters,” Fedorenko says.Speed is the most revolutionary aspect of BCE’s “precision planting” technology, but the drones can also reach places that tractors and humans cannot, at least without significant bodily risk—for example, steep mountainsides or areas with contaminated soil. Drones may even one day help terraform other planets.But it’s not just about trees: “We have a title of tree-planting drone company, but we also do grasses, bushes, flowers, and a lot of fungi,” Fedorenko says. “It’s about restoring what is right for the environment, not just trees.”Pioneer plant species are usually the most successful, “but the general rule is that if you can restore the forest from seeds, then you can use drones to do that,” Fedorenko says.In June, BioCarbon planted 5,000 trees in a day to rehabilitate land ravaged by coal mining in Dungog, Australia. They’ve also worked in South Africa and New Zealand. Since the company’s inception, they’ve used drones to plant more than 25,000 trees across the globe.“If you re-forest a large area of land, you bring back not just fertile soil, but you can really impact local climate, improve the water table, carbon sequestration, increase biodiversity, and, of course, landscapes are never empty so you always have people who are benefiting from the ecosystem,” Fedorenko says.Experts caution that planting itself is not always as important as protection from factors such as overgrazing, agriculture, and fires, to allow natural regeneration of forests to occur. Some experts worry that the efficiency of drone reforestation could even lower motivation for countries to save existing forests. Additionally, in traditional reforestation enterprises, the planting work can provide employment for communities that need it—jobs that could one day be replaced by drones."It's probably easier, in the short term, to plant trees with a drone than fix the issues on the ground, but in the long run, that fix is necessary," says Richard Houghton, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center, a climate change think tank based in Massachusetts. "A technical fix is generally easier than social change, but not as long lasting."With constantly improving GPS and imaging technologies, experts agree that drones have become very useful for accurately mapping large swaths of land and measuring tree and vegetation growth or degradation—even mapping carbon sequestration. But some scientists are more skeptical about their success as a planting technology to combat deforestation on a large scale. For one thing, they only have so much range and battery life."Drones are good for measuring secondary growth and looking at where the forest is coming back, but you fight deforestation at a socioeconomic level," says Arturo Sanchez, director of the University of Alberta's Center for Earth Observation and Sciences. "The issue of climate change is not forest restoration, the issue is energy. It is controlling coal plants, power plants, automobile emissions. Planting trees is very important, but when you look at the distribution of CO2 emissions, deforestation accounts for 10 to 15 percent. The rest is energy. That’s what needs to be controlled."Fedorenko acknowledges that drones alone cannot eliminate all the causes or impacts of deforestation, but she says they could become a useful tool. (See how drones set controlled burns by shooting fireballs.)BCE just started work on a large-scale project to plant mangroves in Myanmar, incorporating this integrated approach to ecosystem restoration. Mangroves in Myanmar’s low-lying Ayeyarwady Delta have been decimated by years of deforestation for agriculture and aquaculture—eighty-four percent of the original mangrove cover is gone.“Mangroves have huge potential to actually save people’s lives because they protect coastal communities from tsunamis,” Fedorenko says. “Not only do they have an impact on the ecosystem, like fish stocks, so that people can maintain their livelihoods, but they are also a literal shield from the ocean.”Their tangled roots also protect coastal areas from erosion.The project spans more than 600 acres and involves a “holistic” approach to measuring success: BCE will be partnering with an NGO to work with local women farmers, training and employing them to collect and prepare the seeds, as well as monitor the ecosystem as the project progresses. BCE will be able to assess whether the mangroves are growing successfully in less than a year.Mangrove forests are also some of the most carbon-rich habitats on the planet, sequestering carbon up to 100 times faster than terrestrial forests. That means they’re incredibly efficient at mitigating the impact of global warming.The project is one step closer to BCE’s main goal: “Of course, our ultimate ambition is to stop climate change,” Fedorenko says with a smile.",
"Marine researcher Charles Moore holds a sample of water with debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which he first discovered in 1997.The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the world’s largest collection of floating trash—and the most famous. It lies between Hawaii and California and is often described as “larger than Texas,” even though it contains not a square foot of surface on which to stand. It cannot be seen from space, as is often claimed.The lack of terra firma did not deter a pair of advertising executives from declaring the patch to be an actual place. They named it the nation of Trash Isles, signed up former Vice President Al Gore as its first “citizen” and last fall, petitioned the United Nations for recognition. The publicity stunt perpetuated the myth.The patch was discovered in 1997 by Charles Moore, a yachtsman who had sailed through a mishmash of floating plastic bottles and other debris on his way home to Los Angeles. It was named by Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a Seattle oceanographer known for his expertise in tracking ocean currents and the movement of cargo lost overboard, including rubber duck bath toys and Nike tennis shoes. The patch is now the target of a $32 million cleanup campaign launched by a Dutch teenager, Boyan Slat, now 23, and head of the Ocean Cleanup, the organization he founded to do the job.Beyond those details, not much was known about the specific contents of the patch—until now.Microplastics make up 94 percent of an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the patch. But that only amounts to eight percent of the total tonnage. As it turns out, of the 79,000 metric tons of plastic in the patch, most of it is abandoned fishing gear—not plastic bottles or packaging drawing headlines today.A comprehensive new study by Slat’s team of scientists, published in Scientific Reports Thursday, concluded that the 79,000 tons was four to 16 times larger than has been previously estimated for the patch. The study also found that fishing nets account for 46 percent of the trash, with the majority of the rest composed of other fishing industry gear, including ropes, oyster spacers, eel traps, crates, and baskets. Scientists estimate that 20 percent of the debris is from the 2011 Japanese tsunami.Laurent Lebreton, an oceanographer with the Ocean Cleanup and the study’s lead author, says the research team was looking to assess the larger pieces.“I knew there would be a lot of fishing gear, but 46 percent was unexpectedly high,” he says. “Initially, we thought fishing gear would be more in the 20 percent range. That is the accepted number [for marine debris] globally—20 percent from fishing sources and 80 percent from land.”Ghostnets, a term coined to describe purposely discarded or accidentally lost netting, drift through the ocean, entangling whales, seals, and turtles. An estimated 100,000 marine animals are strangled, suffocated, or injured by plastics every year.Ocean Cleanup is currently working on a system to remove much of this abandoned fishing gear, with plans to launch later this year.“The interesting piece is that at least half of what they’re finding is not consumer plastics, which are central to much of the current debate, but fishing gear,” says George Leonard, the chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy. “This study is confirmation that we know abandoned and lost gear is an important source of mortality for a whole host of animals and we need to broaden the plastic conversation to make sure we solve this wedge of the problem.”Marine debris expert Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, cautions that the new study is based on only limited surveys, making it difficult to accurately estimate the complete size of the patch. The data are significant in showing such a high accumulation of fishing gear, he notes.This dead albatross chick was found with plastics in its stomach on Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Marine plastic can be dangerous to wildlife.Publication of the garbage patch study coincided with a new report from Britain, Foresight Future of the Sea, that found plastic pollution in the ocean could triple by 2050 unless a “major response” is mounted to prevent plastic from reaching the ocean. The report declared plastic pollution to be one of the main environmental threats to the seas, along with sea-level rise and warming oceans.The study included two aerial surveys in October of 2016 that took 7,000 images, and 652 ocean surface trawls conducted in July, August, and September of 2015 by 18 vessels.The surface trawls also filled in the rest of the story.Fifty plastic items collected had a readable production date: One from 1977, seven from the 1980s, 17 from the 1990s, 24 from the 2000s, and one from 2010. Researchers also found 386 objects with recognizable words or sentences in nine different languages.The writing on a third of the objects was Japanese and another third was Chinese. The country of production was readable on 41 objects, showing they were manufactured in 12 different nations.The study also concluded that plastic pollution is “increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.” Others are not as confident that the conclusion indicates a dramatic change in distribution of marine debris. Much of the world’s marine debris is believed to lie in the coastal regions, not in the middle of oceans.Leonard says he was impressed with the scope of the study. “It’s strong science,” he says. “But at the same time, in this field, the harder we look, the more plastic we find.”",
"Morocco's huge solar power plant, pictured here, generates enough electricity to power two cities the size of Marrakesh, making the country one of only two that are on target to limit emissions to levels in the Paris Agreement.It has been a little under four years since 196 countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, under which they committed to taking steps to limit the increase in global average temperature this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over preindustrial levels, and ultimately to limit that increase to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). Under the agreement, each signatory submits its own national plan, setting targets for emissions reductions and specifying pathways by which it aims to meet those targets.Despite the 2015 agreement, global carbon emissions increased 1.7 percent in 2017 and a further 2.7 percent in 2018; it has been estimated that the rate of increase in 2019 will be among the highest on record. The last four years have been the hottest on record, with 2019 on track to make it five. But analyses suggest that fast action now can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold global increases below 2 degrees C and perhaps 1.5.Are countries making progress? What kind? We got together with the Climate Action Tracker to see who’s dragging their heels and who is making the best efforts. The CAT covers all the biggest emitters and a representative sample of smaller emitters. Their data covers about 80 percent of global emissions and approximately 70 percent of the global population, and grades countries based on how likely their Paris commitments and actions, if replicated by other nations, would be to achieve a world of 1.5 degrees C of warming.“Few major emitters are taking the kind of action that will keep warming to 1.5 Celsius, but some, like India, the EU, and China, could step up at the New York climate summit and announce stronger targets,” says Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, one of the CAT’s constituent organizations.“However, if all governments meet their Paris Agreement target, we calculate the world would still see 3 C of warming, but that warming is likely to be even higher given most are not taking enough action to meet their targets. We still have a long way to go,” he says.As countries prepare to revisit their targets at the United Nations Climate Change Summit on September 23, here is a summary of some of the leaders and stragglers so far.Morocco: According to CAT, Morocco is one of only two countries with a plan to reduce its CO2 emissions to a level consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C. Morocco’s National Energy Strategy calls for generating 42 percent of its electricity production from renewables by 2020, and 52 percent by 2030. Already it is at 35 percent, not least because of investment in such projects as the Noor Ouarzazate complex, the largest concentrated solar farm in the world, which covers an area the size of 3,500 football fields, it generates enough electricity to power two cities the size of Marrakesh.The Gambia: The Gambia is the other country with a 1.5 degrees C emissions reduction strategy. As with Morocco, one of its principal pathways to reduction is the use of renewables, in the form of a program that will increase the country’s electricity capacity by one-fifth partly through construction of one of the largest photovoltaic plants in West Africa. The country has also launched a large project to restore 10,000 hectares of forests, mangroves, and savannas. It is also replacing flooded rice paddies with dry upland rice fields and promoting adoption of efficient cook stoves to reduce the overuse of forest resources.India: India has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy, and in fact it is investing more in them than it is in fossil fuels. Having established a goal of generating 40 percent of its power through renewables by 2030, its progress has been so rapid that it could easily reach that target a decade early, so there is every opportunity for India to increase that target. CAT calculates that India’s plan is compatible with a 2 degree C increase, but that its National Energy Plan could be 1.5 degrees C compatible if the country abandoned plans to build new coal-fired power plants.Costa Rica: Costa Rica aims for its electricity production to be 100 percent renewable by 2021. It’s already extremely close: in 2018 it generated 98 percent of its electricity from renewable sources—primarily hydropower—for the fourth consecutive year. Two-thirds of its greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation, and the country has made it a national priority to use renewable energy across its roads and rails. The National Plan for Electric Transportation calls for at least five percent of the bus fleet to be replaced by electric buses every two years, and for at least 10 percent of new taxi concessions to be given to electric vehicles. Additionally, in February 2019 Costa Rica extended a moratorium on oil extraction and exploitation from 2021 until the end of 2050.European Union: The EU was a comparatively early adopter of climate targets. In 2009, it set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020; its Paris target increased that to a 40 percent reduction by 2030. Its present policies, if fully enacted, would enable it to exceed that target. In May, the EU formally adopted into law a series of measures that included a binding target for 32 percent of electricity production to come from renewables by 2030. To achieve that figure across the EU, different countries within the bloc have adopted different national targets: For example, for Malta, the goal is 10 percent renewables, while for Sweden it is 49 percent.CAT calculates that meeting this and other targets contained in the European Commission’s “Clean Energy for all Europeans” package would result in a reduction in emissions of 48 percent by 2030; a separate study has concluded that further improving energy efficiency targets and closing coal power plants across the EU by 2030 would increase that figure further, to 58 percent. However, because the EU is collectively the third-largest emitter of CO2 behind China and the United States, such a target would just place the bloc in range of a 2 degrees C-compatible reduction.(See 49 years of environmental victories, in photos.)Norway: Norway’s emissions are projected to decrease by only 7 percent by 2030, and its implemented policies are consistent with warming between 3 and 4 degrees C if all others followed a similar level of ambition. However, there are signs of progress. It has set an ambitious target of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2030; and it has adopted legislation committing the country to reducing emissions by 80-95 percent relative to 1990 levels by 2050. Its parliament agreed in June to (mostly) disinvest its $1 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund from oil, gas, and coal, dumping $13 billion in stocks related to fossil fuels (though sparing those belonging to ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell) and diverting resources to renewable energy projects. Norway also leads the world in its embrace of electric cars; almost 60 percent of new cars sold in the country in March were electric. Forest cover is increasing. And electricity production is almost entirely from renewables: 96 percent from hydropower and 2 percent from wind farms.China: The good news: China is on course to meet its Paris targets. The bad news, according to CAT: Those targets are woefully inadequate, and not ambitious enough to limit warming to below 2 degrees C, let alone to 1.5 C as required under the Paris Agreement, unless other countries make much deeper reductions at comparably greater eﬀort. China’s CO2 emissions—already the largest in the world—grew an estimated 2.3 percent increase in 2018; in fact, with current policies, China’s greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise until at least 2030, although a recent study concluded they may in fact peak a decade earlier. The Chinese government has heavily subsidized the manufacture of electric cars and has sought to reduce the number of gasoline-powered cars on the road; in 2018, Chinese consumers bought 1.1 million electric vehicles—more than the rest of the world combined. China is the largest manufacturer of solar technology in the world, but it is also the largest consumer of coal, and is financing the construction of coal-fired power stations around the world.United Kingdom: The U.K. is an interesting case. On the one hand, the country reduced its emissions by 44 percent between 1990 and 2018, even as its economy grew by 75 percent. The government has declared a climate emergency, and in June passed legislation codifying a goal of net zero emissions by 2050. (That was under the previous government; new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown support for climate deniers.) However, the government’s own Committee on Climate Change has advised that the country is lagging far behind many of its stated long-term climate goals, and the nation is roiled with political uncertainty that could directly affect policy in this area. Should Britain leave the European Union with a No-Deal Brexit, it would no longer be able to participate in the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme, for example.Russia: Russia is the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the only large emitter that has yet to ratify the Paris Agreement (although it has indicated that it may do so by the time of the UN Summit on September 23). It is on course to meet its Paris target, but only because that commitment is so weak: It would allow the country’s greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 6 to 24 percent over 2016 levels by 2020 and 15 to 22 percent by 2030. The target also does not require the government to adopt a low-carbon economic development strategy. Internal data on greenhouse gas emissions are scarce, opaque, and out-of-date, making it difficult to confirm progress, or the lack thereof.Russia is for the first time considering legislation to regulate emissions, and President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged that Russia is experiencing the impacts of climate change. However, he has cautioned against “the complete abandonment of nuclear or hydrocarbon energy,” asking metaphorically whether it will be “comfortable for people to live on a planet with a palisade of wind turbines and several layers of solar panels” and claiming that “turbines shake so much that worms come out of the ground.”Saudi Arabia: If anything, Saudi Arabia appears to be going backward in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government’s 2016 “Vision 2030” strategy is actually less ambitious than a 2013 plan that called for the country’s energy industry to diversify from oil dependence. Although Vision 2030 states that Saudi Arabia is planning to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, the government announced in December 2017 that it would slow down this subsidy phase-out to “enhance the economy.” And the kingdom maintains a get-out clause for its Paris targets if it decides the agreement places an “abnormal burden” on the economy by reducing its income from fossil fuels.In March 2018 Saudi Arabia and the SoftBank Group signed a memorandum of understanding to build a 200 GW solar plant, the largest single solar project worldwide; but by December of that year, the project had been canceled. At present, CAT estimates that present plans are likely to result in an increase in emissions by as much as 80 percent on 2015 levels by 2030.Turkey: Turkey is one of only two G20 countries not to have ratified the Paris Agreement, and although the government has committed to investing almost $11 billion in energy efficiency measures, the country is seeking to achieve energy self-sufficiency through a massive expansion in coal-fired power plants. Fully 80 new plants are in the pipeline, equivalent to the capacity of the United Kingdom’s entire energy sector. The Afşin-Elbistan power plant in southern Turkey is expanding to become the biggest coal-fired power plant in the world. CAF has rated Turkey’s Paris targets as “critically insufficient,” calculating that if most other countries followed Turkey’s approach, global warming would exceed 3 to 4 degrees C (5.4 to 7.2 degrees F).Ukraine: Ukraine appears to be heading in the wrong direction. The most recent data (from 2016) shows that the country’s emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industry, agriculture, and waste sources declined by 64 percent below 1990 levels, a function less of efficiency goals than of the fall of the Soviet Union. CAT notes that “Ukraine’s current climate target would see its emissions grow substantially from present levels.”In 2018, Ukraine published a 2050 Low Emission Development Strategy, which if fully implemented could enable it to reach its Paris targets. However, the previous government said it would revisit its Paris pledge after “restoration of its territorial integrity and state sovereignty,” leading activists to accuse the country of using its conflict with Russia-backed rebels to justify climate inaction.United States: Where to begin? CAT already ranked U.S. Paris targets as “insufficient.” With the Trump Administration’s ongoing hostility toward climate action, it now categorizes the country’s efforts as “critically insufficient,” their lowest ranking. Among the swings that the present administration has taken at its predecessor’s climate policy: It has attempted to roll back the Clean Power Plan; sought to relax vehicle efficiency standards to such an extent that even vehicle manufacturers have objected; and announced plans to weaken regulations to limit HFC emissions and regulation of methane leaks from oil and gas production.The administration has been working to actively censor climate science within its own agencies, and has established a climate change review panel tasked with questioning the findings of the country’s National Climate Assessment. The leader of that panel is a climate change denier who has stated that “the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler.”CAT estimates that, if implemented fully, the administration’s policies could by 2030 cause an increase in the U.S.’s annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to the total annual emissions of the state of California.The administration has signaled its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2020.",
"President Donald Trump has proclaimed his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement—a rejection of climate change that moves the country toward isolation on the global stage.In remarks on Thursday, the U.S. president framed the withdrawal as a move intended to boost American industry, while dismissing “praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.”“We want fair treatment for [America’s] citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers,” he added, while signaling an interest in renegotiating the terms of the pact. “We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.” (Read more about how progress on climate change will continue.)Far from reclaiming other countries’ respect, Trump’s decision threatens to make the United States an international pariah. If the U.S. makes good on Trump’s promise to withdraw—which cannot happen until November 4, 2020, one day after the 2020 U.S. presidential elections—the country will join only two other countries that are not parties to the accord, Nicaragua and Syria.Of the three countries, the U.S. stands alone in its rejection of the deal as too onerous.Nicaragua did not join the Paris Agreement because it felt that the agreement’s voluntary goals were insufficient. The Central American country aims to produce 90 percent of its energy via renewables by 2020.Syria’s brutal, years-long civil war—and resulting international sanctions—made it difficult at best for the country to participate in negotiations and submit an emissions-reduction plan.The U.S. withdrawal also threatens to undermine international cooperation with the U.S. on issues unrelated to climate change, warn experts on international diplomacy.“The countries of the world care about climate change… and they understand that the Paris regime cannot work in the long run if the world’s indispensable power has left the table,” wrote Todd Stern, the Obama administration’s chief negotiator at Paris, in a recent essay published by The Atlantic. “The president’s exit from Paris would be read as a kind of ‘drop dead’ to the rest of the world.”“[The decision to withdraw] was a strategic and economic blunder of epic proportions,” adds a current U.S. official knowledgeable on climate diplomacy. “We’re basically ceding political influence, we’re ceding the economic playing field, and we’re ceding the moral high ground.”The U.S. official, who gave a phone interview on the condition of anonymity, notes that the country’s 2001 refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol strained relationships with other countries, particularly in the buildup to the Iraq War.What’s more, the U.S. turnabout fed a perception that the country wasn’t reducing its emissions, despite progress in the private sector and on the state and local level, the official says.Then as now, state and local authorities are filling the void left by the U.S. federal government.The states of New York, California, and Washington—which comprise more than a fifth of the U.S. GDP—have announced a “United States Climate Alliance” aimed at upholding the country’s existing Paris Agreement pledges. On Friday, Connecticut and Massachusetts voiced support for the alliance. Eighty-four U.S. mayors representing 40 million Americans also proclaimed their support for the Paris Agreement, in a separate joint statement.And on Thursday, the New York Times reported that a coalition of U.S. states, cities, and businesses organized by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing a pledge to uphold the U.S.’s Paris commitments.“This is an instance when ignorance and ideology won out over science and common sense, but I think it’s a Pyrrhic victory,” the current U.S. official says. “There are many people in the [federal] government, in state governments, in local governments, in the private sector, and in civil society who understand the obligation the U.S. has to lead on this issue.”“I know of nobody who is giving up the fight,” the official adds. “We understand the stakes—we’re on the right side of history.”",
"The Union Oil Company’s oil spill in February 1969—which covered 800 square miles of ocean and shore in Santa Barbara, California, in crude oil—was widely televised, and it inspired then-Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin to organize the first Earth Day in 1970. That same year, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 went into effect, requiring every major decision of the federal government to be evaluated for its impact on the environment.Another year, another Earth Day to add to the 50 years of environmental successes since the first was celebrated in 1970. Over the decades, momentum behind environmental conservation has ebbed and flowed, but each year has brought at least some signs of environmental progress, somewhere in the world. The pictures here symbolize that hopeful counterpoint—at the rate of one win per year—to the mounting challenges.To mark this year’s anniversary, we note the clean skies the world experienced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. As people holed up at home and vehicles vacated the roads, annual global energy-related emissions fell 5.8 percent, more than in any year since WWII, according to the International Energy Agency.The cleaner air was just one of the things about this strange and terrible year that made many people think harder about how humans manage the global environment—and about the possibility and urgent need of doing better.",
"New research shows that even if the world's major greenhouse gas emitters hit their Paris Agreement targets, seas will rise for hundreds of years into the future.On Monday, the United States officially began the process of pulling out of the Paris Agreement, an international deal struck in 2016 that aimed to keep greenhouse gas emissions low enough to keep Earth’s climate-induced warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit).But even if the U.S. stayed in the agreement, finds new research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, there are long-tail, unavoidable consequences for the world’s coastlines. Even if all countries hit their Paris targets by 2030 and then stopped emitting carbon entirely, an unrealistic scenario but a useful thought experiment, the world’s oceans will still slosh higher. Under these idealistic conditions, by 2300—about eight generations away—sea levels around the world will be about 3 feet higher than today, the scientists say.From the Paris Agreement period alone—between 2015, when the agreement was signed, and 2030, when the stated commitments end—the world will have caused enough warming to drive sea levels about 4.5 inches higher in the future. That’s just from that 15-year stretch.That doesn’t mean the situation is hopeless, the authors say: far from it. What it means is that decisions made today matter greatly. The quicker emissions drop to essentially zero, they found, the slower the ice will respond—giving coastal cities more time to prepare or move, and giving humans more time to devise solutions to the climate crisis.“We can clearly see that there’s a massive sea level rise contribution coming from emissions over such a short time frame, just over the Paris period,” says Alexander Nauels, the lead author of the report and a sea level rise expert at Climate Analytics. “But this is risk we can reduce, by all means, if we can, and it seems like we can.”In 2015, leaders from 195 countries gathered in Paris to sort out an international strategy for addressing climate change. At the meeting they agreed to aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over temperatures in the 1800s, before the Industrial Revolution. It would be even better, the leaders agreed, to keep temperatures from warming past 1.5 degrees.(See which countries are hitting their targets, and which aren't).Since then, an avalanche of major scientific reports backed up the 1.5-degree goal, warning that each bit of warming past that threshold would endanger millions more people and make adaptation harder and more expensive. Other science has demonstrated that those thresholds may have been passed already in many parts of the world.That reality makes the commitments set out in the Paris Agreement even more important to hit.In the 2015 Agreement (which went into effect in 2016), countries agreed to aim to cut their emissions by some self-determined amount by either 2025 or 2030, and to keep revising those goals every five years until then. These “Nationally Determined Contributions,” or NDCs, varied widely in ambition and feasibility, but marked an important benchmark by which progress could be measured. (See which countries are hitting their targets and which aren’t even trying.)The Trump Administration has indicated that it intends to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement. November 4 is the first day it can legally begin the process, which takes a year to complete. Already, though, the U.S. is far from hitting its targets.The NDCs were designed to get countries on track to keep air temperatures from rising too much. But it’s not just heat that will affect people in the future. Warmer air means all kinds of other changes to the climate system, from stronger storms and wetter monsoons to rising seas. Many of those impacts are already being felt.“We’re already seeing the impacts happen much more quickly than we thought we would,,” says Nick Golledge, an ice sheet expert at Victoria University Wellington, in New Zealand, “so we don’t want to get complacent. We are committed to that amount of sea level rise, but there’s still quite a lot we can do about how fast it happens.”But many of the impacts will take a long time to make themselves felt, and probably can’t be reversed even if the world got on track toward its best-laid plans.Sea level changes are one of those slow-developing impacts. Even if emissions dropped to nothing and stayed there, sea levels are still going to rise for the next few hundred years. That’s because the world’s ice responds slowly, like a shuddering, awakening bear coming out of hibernation, to the stimulus we apply now.Over the past few years, scientists have built a robust understanding of how that ice in Greenland, Antarctica, and in the mountains will change, if it’s pushed by hotter temperatures. What they’ve found is that the speed of the change depends strongly on the speed of the warming.In this study, the scientists wanted to pin down exactly how much today’s emissions, and today’s major emitters, would affect the future. They designed an experiment that could calculate the sea level rise from specific time periods and from specific emitters. First, they looked at the sum total of all emissions since the preindustrial period through the end of the Paris Agreement targets in 2030 and found the total amount of sea level rise those emissions would cause in the future: about 17 inches by the end of the century, and over 41 inches by 2300, on average.Then, they broke those numbers down further. Five countries or regions—the U.S., China, India, Russia, and the EU—account for well over half of total emissions today. Each of those countries, therefore, will be responsible for a measurable amount of sea level rise in the future. From just the 15-year Paris Agreement period—2016 to 2030, the time when countries are allegedly doing serious work to rein in emissions—those top five emitters will lock in about 4.5 inches of sea level rise in the future, or 20 percent of 2300’s total.Over what the authors call the “IPCC period,” starting from 1990, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC) published its first major report on how humans were affecting Earth’s climate and stretching through 2030, those top five emitters will be personally responsible for over 10 inches of sea level rise by 2030.In comparison, the planet has seen an average about 8 inches of sea level rise since 1900.“Even a few inches it doesn’t sound like much, but every bit matters,” says Kristina Hill, a landscape architect and environmental design expert at the University of California, Berkeley. “Especially for things like pollution. You have a pollution lump sitting there in the soil, and it only takes the water intersecting it for that to be a problem, and higher sea levels mean more chance of that.”Recently, scientists also re-evaluated the maps they’d been using to figure out how global cities will be affected by sea level rise. It turns out that, after correcting the satellite data that shows how high the ground is in many coastal cities worldwide, around 190 million people will live below 2100’s high tide line—about 80 million more than today, and about three times as many as had previously been expected.For those 190 million people, just a little bit of extra water adds a lot of risk, explains Peter Girard of Climate Central, which did the re-evaluation.“It’s the difference between damaged property or not, or an overtopped road or a dry one,” he says.Although 280 years may feel far away, it’s well within the range of human memory. “I grew up in a country, in the U.K., where we still drove on roads built by the Romans 2,000 years before,” says Golledge. “So let’s not think that a few hundred years is outside of the realm of reality for our infrastructure.”And the actions that are taken now—in pursuit of the Paris Agreement goals, or even more ambitious emissions reductions goals, will shape the experiences for millions of people in the future.“The most important factor in continuing to protect people and building new defenses is time,” says Girard. “The more and the sooner global emissions are reduced, the slower the rate of sea level rise will be, and the more time governments and communities around the world will have to evaluate and plan and build defenses.”",
"A coal-fired power plant in Conesville, Ohio, is among many greenhouse gas emitters the world is struggling to rein in.The world is not doing enough to curb its collective carbon emissions, a new UN report warns.In an audit of the global Paris Agreement released Tuesday, the UN Environment Programme finds that if action to combat climate change is limited to just current pledges, the Earth will get at least three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by 2100 relative to preindustrial levels.This amount of warming would vastly exceed the Paris Agreement’s goal, which is to limit global warming by the end of the century to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. The main driver of recent warming, which has profoundly discombobulated the global climate, has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2).The report’s release comes on the eve of COP23, a sequel of sorts to the 2015 UN meeting that spawned the Paris Agreement. It also comes the day after the UN confirmed that 2016’s atmospheric CO2 levels were the highest Earth has seen in the last 800,000 years. Methane levels have also reached record highs.“One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, head of UNEP, in a statement.“This is unacceptable. If we invest in the right technologies, ensuring that the private sector is involved, we can still meet the promise we made to our children to protect their future. But we have to get on the case now.”To give ourselves a two-out-of-three chance of avoiding two degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, the new report says that 2030’s total emissions can’t exceed 42 billion tons of CO2 equivalent. This threshold represents about 80 percent of 2016’s carbon emissions, which totaled 52 billion tons of CO2 equivalent.Pledges made under the Paris Agreement fall well short of achieving this goal. Even in a best-case scenario for existing pledges, global emissions in 2030 will fall between 53 to 55.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in 2030. That amounts to an overshoot of 11 to 13.5 billion tons, or more than twice the United States’ 2016 carbon footprint.The report, however, does offer glimmers of good news. Despite steady increases overall in total emissions, the audit finds that since 2014, global carbon emissions from fossil fuel use, cement production, and international transport have more or less stabilized around 35 billion tons CO2 equivalent.Also of note is the Paris Agreement’s near-universal adoption. Of all the countries on Earth, only Syria has refused to join the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua, which for years had criticized the Paris Agreement as insufficient, joined the pact in late October.That said, on June 1, the United States declared its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2020—the only country to do so. The Trump Administration has decried the voluntary pact’s supposed strictures on the U.S. economy.In the absence of action on the federal level, U.S. state and local governments, as well as the U.S. private sector, have attempted to push forward and honor the Paris Agreement.At this writing, 14 states and Puerto Rico have formed a non-binding “U.S. Climate Alliance” that has pledged to honor U.S. obligations under the Paris Agreement. A separate climate effort called We Are Still In claims the support of states, cities, businesses, and universities representing more than 127 million Americans and $6.2 trillion of U.S. GDP.",
"Meltwater gushes from an ice cap on the island of Nordaustlandet, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, and the ice in the region is melting fast.Climate change is here, heating the oceans and crumbling the planet’s ice sheets, a new report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lays out.On Wednesday, the IPCC released a major report on the state of the planet's oceans and ice. The 900-page report, which compiles the findings from thousands of scientific studies, outlines the damage climate change has already done to the planet’s vast oceans and fragile ice sheets and forecasts the future for these crucial parts of the climate system.Climate change’s impacts, the report says, are already readily visible from the top of the highest mountain to the very bottom of the ocean—and tangible for every human on the planet.The problems aren’t theoretical, the report stresses: Science shows that they are here, now. And the oceans, polar ice caps, and high mountain glaciers have already absorbed so much extra heat from human-caused global warming that the very systems human existence depends on are already at stake.For example, Planpincieux glacier on the Italian side of Mount Blanc is expected to collapse at any time, prompting road closures and evacuations of structures in the area. And in the oceans, many fisheries have shifted and shrunken, impacting million-dollar businesses and subsistence fishers alike. The 27 percent of Earth’s human population that lives near coasts are bearing the brunt of higher seas and stronger storms. Marine “heat waves” sweep across the ocean twice as often as they did only three decades ago. And millions that rely on water from high-mountain glaciers and snowpack, the "water towers" of the world, are adjusting to both newly strengthened floods and devastating droughts.These challenges are only going to get worse unless countries make lightning-fast moves to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, the report says. But strong, decisive action could still forestall or evade some of the worst impacts."The oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat of climate change for decades,” says Ko Barrett, the vice chair of the IPCC. “The report highlights the urgency of timely, ambitious, coordinated, and enduring actions. What’s at stake is the health of ecosystems, wildlife, and importantly, the world we leave our children."In 2015, world leaders gathered in Paris at a climate-focused meeting, where they agreed to try to limit planetary warming to an average of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures—and to aim for a more ambitious goal of keeping warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).At the time, 2 degrees Celsius was considered a “safe” target. Keeping the planet’s average temperature below that, world leaders said, would still result in great stresses on the economy, social systems, and natural environments, but would stave off the most devastating impacts.Since then, two things have happened: First, science has made clear that the planet has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius, on average, while some regions, like the Arctic, have overshot that warming by at least four times. Second, thousands of scientists have diligently catalogued evidence that even 1.5 degrees of warming could push parts of the climate system in ways that would have devastating environmental, social, and economic impacts.The IPCC gathers up evidence from scientists worldwide and summarizes the state of knowledge about the planet’s present and future, and sets about reassessing what the past few years of new science could tell us. Since 1990, it has prepared five comprehensive assessment reports, and it’s currently working on the sixth. It also prepares special reports on specific topics—including three important ones in just the past year.The first, released last year, warned that even 1.5 degrees of warming would wreak havoc on the planet. The second, a few months ago, outlined both the already-observed impacts and likely future of lands and forests. This latest report, on the oceans and ice caps, rounds out the trio. (A related report, released earlier this year, summarized climate change’s impact on the planet’s biodiversity, warning of imminent collapses in many delicate ecosystems).In 2008, Opal Reef, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, teemed with life. Its corals were healthy and robust.By 2018, after some of the hottest years the reef had ever experienced, the scene was much different.Taken together, the reports offer a bleak vision of the future, particularly because it is rapidly becoming apparent that both the 1.5- and the 2-degree Celsius goals will be difficult, if not impossible, to hit. The 1.5 degrees report said countries would have to aim for a “net-zero” greenhouse gas situation by 2050 in order to meet that target. But we’re currently on a very different track—one that leads us to 3.5 degrees or more of warming by the end of the century. (See how the planet’s carbon budget looks now).Last week, an estimated four million people worldwide marched in a global climate strike, demanding that world leaders take action to address climate change. But earlier this week, when world leaders gathered at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, they collectively failed to announce any major new commitments to solving the carbon problem. Meaningful action is still sparse—only a few countries are close to hitting the targets for reducing their emissions.This report summarizes decades of research from scientists worldwide and focuses on two crucial parts of the climate system: oceans and ice. Climate change has already reshaped both.The ocean has borne the brunt of the impacts, absorbing over 90 percent of the extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by excess greenhouse gases since the 1970s and somewhere between 20 to 30 percent of the carbon dioxide. That means water has buffered land-dwellers against the worst effects of climate change; without it, the atmosphere would have heated up much more than the average of 1 degree it already has.“The rate of climate change has actually gone up since 1993, and that rate of warming of global oceans has actually doubled since then,” says Nathan Bindoff, a lead author on the report and an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania.In tandem, marine heat waves—short bursts of hot marine weather—have also doubled, stressing out anything that they sweep over.Brian Skerry has been a contributing photographer for National Geographic magazine since 1998. His new book, Ocean Soul, features spectacular images from a 30-year career in underwater photography. Browse a selection of his pictures in this gallery.

And marine life is obviously impacted. The list goes on: there’s all sorts of payback from the oceans’ absorption of the extra heat,” he says.Hotter oceans fuel stronger hurricanes and rainier storms. But warming also has influences less obvious to humans. As the surface of the water warms, it gets lighter, making it harder to mix it with cold, nutrient-rich water below. So the top part of the ocean stagnates slightly, holding less oxygen and less of the critical nutrients that support marine life. And the carbon dioxide bleeding into the ocean is causing it to become more acidic, stressing out any organism that builds its shells out of acid-sensitive calcium carbonate, from tiny plankton to oysters to massive reef-building corals.All together, the effects on marine life are far from subtle. Already, the report summarizes, about 30 percent of the world’s reefs have been stressed to near their breaking point, and 60 percent are heavily threatened. With 1.5 degrees of warming—the ambitious target, given that we’ve burned through a degree of that already—science tells us that 70 to 90 percent of reefs could collapse by 2100. At 2 degrees, that number jumps to more than 99 percent.That’s devastating for the reefs themselves, but also for the communities that live near and rely on them, the report says. Reefs operate as barriers to soften the blow of storms and waves on coastal communities; as nursery zones for many of the fish that feed humans worldwide; they sustain tourism and cultural practice for coastal communities; and more.The warming of the top layer of the ocean also affects the fisheries humans rely on. Already, a range of marine species have been marching poleward in search of cooler climes. (Read about how “global fish wars” caused by climate change could be coming).“Now, there’s tons of evidence, decades of change that we’ve observed, and now we can go in and say we are confident that climate change is influencing so many of these different species,” says Jennifer Sunday, a marine biologist at McGill University.And if we continue tracking forward with the same high-carbon lifestyle the planet is currently on, science suggests that fish stocks could decrease by nearly 20 percent by the end of the century. Already, catches from open-ocean fisheries, like tuna, have stagnated, the report summarizes. That’s partly because of overfishing, but the pattern is exacerbated by climate change.Ice everywhere—from the high mountains to the polar ice caps—is also changing, and fast.Some impacts of melting ice are felt very directly by communities that live nearby. In the high mountains, like the Andes or the Himalaya, glaciers are retreating at unprecedented rates some 30 percent higher than a few decades ago, the report says.Glacier melt currently provides fresh water to millions of high-mountain dwellers, as well as communities downstream. As glaciers retreat, the amount, timing, and quality of the meltwater change—and people have to respond.In the high Himalaya, meltwater courses into lakes that sit at the edge of retreating glaciers. The lakes are often perched precariously above towns and villages, threatening to flood the settlements below.And in Peru, the extra melt coming off the rapidly retreating glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca has an expanding high-elevation agricultural boom. But that glacier—like most of the high-mountain ice in the world—is likely to disappear or dwindle to a nub of its former self by the middle of the century, reshaping the economy of the region.“These glaciers are critical for all kinds of water resources,” says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado. “Drinking water, agriculture, energy production, so much more. Even where they’re not perhaps problematic at this moment, they will be soon; we can very clearly see these problems coming down the line.”Changes in Earth’s ice also affect people who live far from the high mountains or the poles. Since the early 1900s, average sea levels around the world have risen by about 16 centimeters (just over 6 inches). Now, the report says, melt from Greenland and Antarctica, the planet’s great storehouses of ice, is the primary driver of rising sea levels around the world. Melt from those ice sheets is now responsible for over half of the sea level rise happening today—about 1.8 millimeters each year.That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up fast, and the number is projected to go way up. But the speed at which the ocean rises, and how much higher it will get, depends on how we collectively manage our carbon budgets now.If all countries held themselves to their most ambitious goals, the polar ice sheets would add somewhere between 5 to 23 centimeters to the world’s oceans by 2100 (the mountain glaciers and the expansion of warmer ocean waters would add more). But if we continue on a path similar to today’s, by the end of the century the ice sheet could add much more melt to the oceans: between 11 to 55 centimeters.Overall, that means sea level rise of just over 40 centimeters by 2100 if we’re careful, and over 80 centimeters—more than 2 feet—if we’re not.And, the IPCC report points out, there is emerging evidence that those numbers could jump even higher if a major tipping point in Antarctica is crossed. Warm water, creeping closer and closer to a delicate part of the West Antarctic ice sheet, could initiate a runaway melting situation that would cause vast swaths of the ice sheet to collapse.“It’s really this sort of doomsday scenario,” says Brooke Medley, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “Once you trigger that retreat, it’s nearly impossible to stop.”The report makes explicit mention of the possibility but doesn’t include those estimates in the 2100 projections.In West Antarctica, the ice responds to changes in the ocean, and vice versa. That’s a perfect illustration of the climate system, says Regine Hock, a glaciologist at the University of Alaska and a lead author on a chapter of the report: It's an interconnected set of phenomena. What happens in one part of the world is far from isolated.“The changes we see are not only consistent across the systems, but they’re linked. From the highest mountains to the oceans, these systems are directly linked to each other,” says Hock.And the choices humans make in one part of the world can affect every other. The future looks very different in a world where emissions drop quickly, the report shows.“Our future depends on who we are and what we can do together,” says Heidi Steltzer, a lead author of the report and a mountain scientist at Fort Lewis College. “It’s a time when we must collaborate on solutions.”",
"Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100.The number of Americans who could be displaced by rising seas will triple by the end of this century. That’s the stark new conclusion of scientists who studied the impact of climate change on coastal areas.As many as 13.1 million people in the United States will be in the path of flooding by 2100, three times the current population that resides in low-lying coastal areas, according to the paper published online Monday in Nature Climate Change. The researchers took into account rapid population growth along the coasts in a way never done before."Populations are very dynamic by their very nature," says demographer and lead author Mathew Hauer of the University of Georgia. "You can end up with an obsolete assessment very quickly" in a study that doesn't fully capture the change already underway, he says.An estimated 4.9 million people could be forced from the coasts if seas rise 2.95 feet (0.9 meter) and coastal areas don't take protective measures such as dikes or man-made buffer islands, according to the study. The number displaced could balloon to 13.1 million if seas rise 5.9 feet (1.8 meters.)The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts sea levels will rise 8 inches (0.3 meter) to 6.6 feet (2 meters) by 2100, depending on the speed and extent of polar ice melt.The new study underscores the challenge facing U.S. coastal cities as they grapple with global warming's impact on a landscape that happens to be the nation's most sought-after real estate.Waves crash below cliffside apartments in Pacifica, Calif., which is located in San Mateo County, one of the ten most populous areas expected to be affected by rising seas, according to a new study.The potential exodus from the coasts could be similar in size to the 20th century's Great Migration of 6 million African-Americans from the south, the authors wrote. The locus of the crisis would be similar: Nearly 70 percent of the people at risk will reside in the southeastern United States, with half of that concentrated in one state—Florida.Miami-Dade County and neighboring Broward County, with potentially 3.5 million at risk under the high sea-level scenario, would account for more than a quarter of those displaced.But the study, which took land elevation into account, also predicts "catastrophic impacts" for a handful of sparsely populated low-lying counties, such as Tyrell County, North Carolina. Tyrell, which bills itself as "nature's buffer zone" between the popular seashore resorts of the Outer Banks and the state's urban mainland, boasts the only mainland population of red wolves in the wild, as well as more than two dozen groups of endangered red cockaded woodpeckers. But 92 percent of its human population--about 6,000 people by 2100—will live on land at risk of inundation in the high sea-level rise scenario.Many areas of the West Coast and the northeastern United States will see little impact from sea level rise, the researchers say. Still, San Mateo County on San Francisco Bay would be one of the ten most populous areas affected, with 250,000 people in the path of flooding in case of high sea level rise, according to the study.Hauer says his team included both the number and percentage of people at risk in the 319 coastal U.S. counties because both will be important. "We need to figure out where we're going to deploy critical infrastructure to protect coastal populations, and we hope this is a tool decision-makers can leverage," he says.The authors project population change at an unusually detailed level by accounting for changes dating back to 1940 in U.S. Census block groups, the smallest geographical units containing rich demographic data.Coastal engineer Robert Nicholls, professor at the University of Southampton in England, who was not involved in the study, says it was "very sensible" to take rising population trends into account. But Nicholls, who has served as a lead author for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, notes the projections don't take into account human behavior."If nobody's protected, would people continue to move to the coast?" he says. "And will these people be left to adapt for themselves—which probably does mean some kind of retreat—or might they be protected?"Moreover, flooding is only one of many possible fates for the coastline as sea level rises. Scientists led by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) published a separate analysis in the same issue of Nature Climate Change on Monday concluding that as much as 70 percent of the coastal landscape has some ability to adapt to sea level rise. The analysis includes the possibility—and uncertainty—of built structures to fend off flooding. But it also takes into account how the shoreline may change its shape through natural processes like erosion and deposition, rather than flooding, in response to sea level rise.USGS geologist Erika Lentz likens it to pouring water in a bucket of sand or sponges rather than pouring water into a bucket of rocks."Our analysis is adding the sand and the sponges," she says. "A barrier island might breach, it might over wash, inlets might be formed, sediment might move around, a marsh might migrate, a forest might transition to a marsh. Another way to put it is there are lots of places on the coast that want to change in response to sea level rise."But Lentz says this is not reason for complacency. "What we're trying to provide policymakers with is a better picture of what areas might be used for mitigation, for buffering, and other trade-offs: what areas are likely to change, versus drown."",
"A bed of seagrass near Vancouver Island in Canada. Seagrass beds, like kelp forests and coral reefs, are home to diverse marine life. Warm waters threaten the health of these ecosystems.Intense heat waves are bad for human health. They can lead to sometimes deadly conditions like dehydration and stroke. And just like extreme temperatures on land, marine heat waves can drastically alter life under the sea.A new study published today in Nature Climate Change found that the occurrences of marine heat waves have substantially grown in the past three decades, and it’s becoming clearer how deadly warmer temperatures are for biodiversity.Marine heat waves are periods when the average water temperature of a given region is exceptionally high. In the past 30 years marine heat wave days have increased by just over 54 percent, a trend the study’s authors found consistent with declines in oceans life.High-profile marine heat waves like “the blob,” a huge mass of warm water that was present off the U.S. West Coast from 2014-2016, were included in the study. The blob was responsible for massive die-offs of everything from invertebrates to marine mammals.“It is clear that extreme warming events can drive abrupt changes in entire ecosystems with widespread consequences,” says study author ecologist Daniel Smale.To get a global snapshot of how marine heat waves are changing life in the world's oceans, Smale and his research team looked at 116 previously published papers. It gave them data from over 1,000 different ecological records. Heat waves were quantified as any period longer than five days when the ocean warmed to abnormally high temperatures.They then used existing datasets to quantify the amount of biodiversity in a given region. Particularly worrying to the scientists were regions with dense biodiversity that experienced warming. Those regions were especially at risk of life being damaged or dying off and having cascading effects on neighboring ecosystems.Three regions were particularly hard hit by warming waters, the study notes: coral reefs in the Caribbean, seagrass in Australia, and kelp forests off the coast of California.Warming disrupts the typical functions of such massive ecological habitats. Corals, for instance, become stressed when subjected to warmer-than-average temperatures. They then expel their symbiotic algae and undergo a process called coral bleaching where the normally colorful coral becomes sickly and turns a stark white.In 2005, the U.S. lost half of its Caribbean corals. On the Great Barrier Reef, more than half of the region's corals are already dead. When corals die, they can no longer support the hundreds of fish and other marine species that live on the reefs.“Coral reefs that evolved with just a few weeks of above-average temperatures every decade or so are now suffering up to three months of extreme temperature every few years,” says ecologist Enric Sala, a National Geographic explorer who was not involved with the study.“For example, tropical storms will create even more destruction because coral reefs won't be able to continue growing and protecting the shores from waves,” he says.Shrinking biodiversity may also one day have profound impacts on food security and sea-based economies. Last week, a study published in the journal Science found that climate change is causing fish to disappear. Global populations of fish taken for human consumption by fisheries have decreased by around 4 percent. For some regions that experience warming waters as well as overfishing, the decline is more than 30 percent.Smale also worries that the loss of critical regions like coral reefs, seagrass beds, and kelp forests will only add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Scientists estimate the ocean has absorbed 26 percent of the carbon released into the atmosphere in the past decade. All of the carbon that was absorbed by underwater flora is released when the ecosystem dies.“Ocean systems are facing a number of threats, such as plastic pollution and ocean acidification,” says Smale. “But it is clear that extreme warming events can drive abrupt changes in entire ecosystems with widespread consequences.”He predicts that warming events will continue to threaten the balance of ocean life in the coming decades.“The ultimate cause is something we have to address,” says Katie Matthews, the deputy chief scientist at Oceana. “If we don’t do that, everything else we work on will have little to no impact.”She adds that climate-conscious fishery management and monitoring ocean warming in real time are tools that can help minimize impacts from warming events in the meantime.",
"A new study published Thursday in the journal Science outlines the impacts warming waters are having on commercially important fish species.The world's fishing industry relies on what's called fisheries, the clusters of regional fish populations that people can catch economically. And on average, the researchers found that the numbers of fish in critical fisheries around the world have decreased by four percent since 1930.Fisheries located in the Sea of Japan and the North Sea were the worst off. They experienced as much as a 35 percent drop in their numbers. Other fisheries, however, benefitted from warmer waters, and their populations grew, an expansion scientists warn could create unsustainable competition for resources.“We were surprised at the strength the impact of warming has already had on fish populations,” says the study's lead author, ecologist Chris Free at the University of California Santa Barbara.To measure the effect of warming and overfishing, Free started by looking at temperature data from the past 80 years and comparing it to how productive a given fishery was during periods of higher-than-average temperatures. The team looked at 235 populations of 124 species of fish spread across 38 different regions.Warmer waters can make some fisheries smaller by putting metabolic stress on the fish, making it harder for them to reproduce or find food. Warm waters can also cause zooplankton, essential fish food, to decline. The impacts on smaller organisms then have cascading impacts on the rest of the food chain.In the North Sea and the Sea of Japan where they measured increased water temperature, scientists found overfishing had further made the fisheries even more vulnerable.“It's like a one-two punch,” says study co-author Malin Pinsky, an ecologist at Rutgers. “If fishing already knocks them down, they're more likely to respond poorly when it's hot.”“When Chris brought me these figures, I was really stunned,” Pinsky adds. “We knew that animals were moving into new locations, but I didn't realize it already affected the ability of these populations to produce fish.”Fisheries ecologist Will White from Oregon State University was not involved with Free and Pinsky's study, but he says their conclusions highlight the importance of managing fisheries.“With a lot of fisheries off the West Coast, we have historically had pretty good fishery management, which has given us resilience,” says White.From 2014 to 2016, the West Coast felt the deadly presence of a patch of warmer water called the “blob.” When it warmed Pacific waters, it killed off marine creatures like zooplankton that salmon feed on, jeopardizing the health of Oregon's lucrative salmon fisheries.“I'm not sure there's a way to manage our way out of that,” White says of acute ocean warming, but on a less dramatic, global scale, he says taking warming oceans into consideration should be an important fishery management tool.Pinsky cautions against viewing growing populations as a good sign.“Fish are a bit like goldilocks,” says Pinsky. “For some it's too cold, but warming will make it too hot.”Growing populations of one fish could also encroach upon the territory of another species. Off the coast of New England, populations of black sea bass have increased.“Turns out,” he adds, “they like to eat lobster. As they become more abundant, they may start impacting American lobster. There are all these ripple effects.”If current population trends continue at the same rate, the world will need to double its food production by 2050. To compensate, world leaders are consistently looking toward fisheries to be a critical source of proteinfor millions of people.In 2016, 171 million tons of fish were taken from the sea, and that number is expected to rise to 201 million over the next 10 years.“Food security is a big concern,” says Pinsky. An estimated three billion people use fish as their primary source of protein.“Beyond that,” Pinsky adds, “we also know that it has very important local impacts for those who make their livelihoods catching these fish.”He thinks better management can help mitigate the impacts of warming. Establishing “no-take” zones, for instance, allow fish time to reproduce and regrow overfished populations.Ultimately, Free says his study highlights the wide-ranging impacts of burning greenhouse gases. Unabated, he says some fisheries will likely continue their decline.He adds, “We'll just have to be adaptive.”",
"Catch from a pink salmon fishery.If current population trends continue, experts estimate the world will need to double food production by 2050, and those same experts say fish are the answer.“We're running out of options on land,” says Vera Agostini from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. “There's only so much we can take from the planet, so fisheries and aquaculture will be critical.”In 2016, fisheries yielded 171 million tons of fish for consumption. By 2030, that number is expected to reach 201 million tons.To reach that goal, fisheries face a host of environmental issues and economic concerns, and advocates are saying not all fishing might be worth the effort.Earlier this summer, the FAO published a comprehensive overview of the fishing industry called The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture. It outlined the history of an industry they expect to play a critical role in meeting food consumption targets.As a food source, fish can be a key source of protein. Just 150 grams of fish can provide the average adult with over half of their daily protein requirement. In developing countries with growing economies and individual wealth, like China, fish consumption is booming. In 2016, Europe, Japan, and the U.S. were consuming just under half the world's caught fish. By 2015, Asia was consuming two thirds of the world's caught fish.Both a growing population and an increasingly wealthy one demand foods rich in protein and nutrition. A 2015 study published in the journal Food Security found that fish accounted for 10 percent of the world's food security.The paper's authors, some former FAO analysts, wrote that they were making the case for fish to be increasingly added to the “overall debate and future policy about food security and nutrition.”Other researchers have been more skeptical about how fish can become a more bountiful food supply, particularly fish that comes from the high seas.A paper published last week in the journal Science Advances found that fishing done on the high seas (any region 200 miles offshore any land) plays a negligible role in ensuring global food security.“Most of the fish are sold as an upscale food items,” says ecologist Enric Sala, a National Geographic Explorer who authored the study. “Small local operations don't fish in the high seas. The fishing on the high seas is conducted by larger industrial fleets.”That's because, between fuel and labor costs, high seas fishing is expensive. In another paper published by Sala in Science Advances last June, a team of researchers found that as much as 54 percent of high seas fishing would be unprofitable were it not for government subsidies.To reach the most expansive parts of the globe, fishing vessels generally come from wealthier nations. Eighty-five percent of high seas fishing is done by China, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.It's not just the high seas that are dominated by wealthy nations. On August 1, another Science Advances study confirmed that, even beyond the high seas, those five countries dominate industrial fishing as a whole.Critics of industrial fishing, like Sala, argue that the FAO should focus on small-scale fisheries, not industrial ones, when strategizing how to feed the world.Unlike wild fish, farm-raised fish are grown in fresh water or salt water pens.In 2014, the World Bank published a report stating that, by 2030, 62 percent of the world's seafood will be farm-raised.In their 2016 report, the FAO found that aquaculture already accounted for 47 percent of the seafood we consume.A Nature study published in August of last year ambitiously outlined how aquaculture could potentially be scaled up to meet the world's demand for seafood without depleting ocean stocks.In certain parts of the ocean, the study identified regions as deep as 650 feet that could be used to grow certain kinds of fish. By leveraging the available space they estimated, the study's authors concluded that 15 billion metric tones of fish could be farmed every year.A greater emphasis on fishing worries some environmental activists.At sea, increasing the number of wild-caught fish has led to overfishing, or entirely depleted fisheries. Strict regulations on where fishers can fish and what they can catch has been effective, says NOAA. In 2017, the organization published a report finding that overfished stocks in U.S. waters remained low. It's a significant improvement, they say, from nearly 20 years ago when several commonly eaten species were almost fished to extinction.Fishing nets can also harm the environment. Some accidentally ensnare animals like marine mammals. Trawls can tear up habitats like coral. And old fishing nets are one of the top sources of ocean pollution.The U.N. also intends to increase the amount of protected areas in the ocean. While some MPAs allow fishing, others are completely restricted and have previously left industry and activists competing for the same space. Both Sala and Agostini say they hope MPAs can be used as a tool to improve the health of adjacent stocks, making them more lucrative.Farming fish, instead of catching them wild, isn’t always the silver bullet it sometimes seems.Some fish species cope with small, contained spaces better than others, and those that don't are prone to developing and spreading diseases.In offshore aquaculture farms, faulty cages or storms could allow diseased fish to escape, infecting wild populations nearby. Sites that are inland are also at risk from disease spread.At the FAO, Agostini says the organization is optimistically planning to create more sustainable ocean practices while drastically increasing fish as a food source over the next 18 years.",
"Scientists have long been sounding the alarm about a looming catastrophe of ocean overfishing—the harvesting of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for species to replace themselves. Yet for two decades, global leaders have been at an impasse in their efforts to reverse the damage that has been done.Marine scientists know when widespread overfishing of the seas began. And they have a pretty good idea when, if left unaddressed, it will end badly. Here’s a look at the critical issues in overfishing—from its effects on biodiversity to the limited successes of mitigation efforts.The earliest overfishing occurred in the early 1800s when humans, seeking blubber for lamp oil, decimated the whale population around Stellwegen Bank, off the coast of Cape Cod. Some fish consumed in the United States, including Atlantic cod, herring, and California's sardines, were also harvested to the brink of extinction by the mid-1900s. These isolated, regional depletions were highly disruptive to the food chain—which only became more precarious in the late 20th century.In the mid-20th century, countries around the world worked to build their fishing capacities to ensure the availability and affordability of protein-rich foods. Favorable policies, loans, and subsidies spawned a rapid rise of big industrial fishing operations, which quickly supplanted local fishers as the world's main source of seafood.These large, profit-seeking commercial fleets were aggressive, scouring the world's oceans and developing ever more sophisticated methods and technologies for finding, extracting, and processing their target species. Consumers soon grew accustomed to having access to a wide selection of fish at affordable prices.But by 1989, when about 90 million tonnes (metric tons) of fish were taken from the ocean, the industry had hit its high point, and yields have declined or stagnated ever since. Fisheries for the most sought-after species, like orange roughy, Chilean sea bass, and bluefin tuna, have collapsed for lack of fish. In 2003, a scientific report estimated that industrial fishing had reduced the number of large ocean fish to just 10 percent of their pre-industrial population.Why high seas fishing isn't just destructive—it's unprofitable.Faced with the collapse of large-fish populations, commercial fleets began traveling deeper in the ocean and farther down the food chain for viable catches. This so-called "fishing down" has triggered a chain reaction that is upsetting the ancient and delicate balance of the sea's biologic system.Coral reefs, for example, are particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Plant-eating fish keep these ecosystems in balance by eating algae, keeping the coral clean and healthy so that it can grow. Fishing out too many herbivores—whether intentionally or as bycatch—can weaken reefs and make them more susceptible to being ravaged by extreme weather events and climate change. Fishing equipment and debris can also physically destroy the fragile corals that make up the reef foundations.Overfishing can also harm other marine species. Trawling, a method in which boats pull massive nets behind them in the water, pulls in more than just shrimp and bluefin tuna—it captures just about anything in its path. Sea turtles, dolphins, sea birds, sharks, and other animals have all faced existential threats as bycatch.Over the years, as fisheries have caught less and less, humans have begun to understand that the oceans, assumed to be unendingly vast and rich, are in fact highly vulnerable. In 2006, a study of catch data published in the journal Science grimly predicted that if such unsustainable fishing rates continue, all the world's fisheries will collapse by 2048.Many scientists say most fish populations could be restored with aggressive fisheries management and better enforcement of laws governing catches, including instituting catch limits. An increased use of aquaculture, the farming of seafood, would also help. And in many regions, there is reason for hope.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)—which lays out international standards for fisheries management—pointed out in its 2020 report that there has been a slight increase in the percentage of stocks that are sustainably producing the most food possible, which is the goal of fisheries management.Still, many challenges remain. About a third of global stocks are overfished—and the overall proportion of fish stocks at sustainable levels has continued to decline. The FAO report says this deterioration of fish stocks can particularly be seen “in places where fisheries management is not in place, or is ineffective.” Of the areas the organization monitors, the Mediterranean and Black Sea had the highest percentage of stocks—62.5 percent—fished at unsustainable levels.Government subsidies to the fishing industry remain a significant challenge to reversing this troubling trend. One global survey found that in 2018 nations spent $22 billion on so-called harmful subsidies that fuel overfishing—a 6 percent rise from 2009.As National Geographic reported at the time, harmful subsidies are those that fund practices that would not otherwise be profitable, such as for industrial trawlers’ fuel costs. China, for example, has increased its harmful subsidies by 105 percent over the past decade.World Trade Organization members have been discussing how to limit these subsidies since 2001—with little progress. And despite a pledge by members of the United Nations to forge an agreement by 2020, that deadline has passed with no resolution.In 2021, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called on members to reach an agreement, arguing that a “failure to do so would jeopardize the ocean’s biodiversity and the sustainability of the fish stocks on which so many depend for food and income.”It’s unclear whether countries will muster the political will to follow through. But what is clear to scientists is that it is one of many measures that’s critical to saving the world’s oceans.",
"A fisherman checks his fishing lines while fishing on the high seas. The high seas is defined as the open waters outside a country's exclusive economic zone, generally 200 miles past the shore.A fish’s journey from ocean to plate may not be as straightforward as it sounds.Most people are aware that a fisher, a grocer and a cook were involved in that journey. But a new study finds that governments lend a hand, too—and a mighty big one.A paper, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, found that as much as 54 percent of high seas fishing would be unprofitable were it not for governments covering some of the industry's costs. To a lesser degree, the study also found that exploited labor and underreported catch may explain how large vessels afford to fish in international waters.“The study confirmed that much of the high seas fishing does not make sense,” says study author and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala. “If it's ecologically destructive and economically unprofitable, why don't we end all high seas fishing?”In 2016, just over 3,600 vessels actively fished on the high seas—the open ocean outside any country's jurisdiction. To better understand this impact, the research team of ecologists, data scientists, and economists looked at the most recent cost datasets available, from 2014. They found that the total cost of fishing in that year ranged anywhere from 6.2 to 8 billion USD and that subsidies totaled around 4.2 billion USD.By far, their data showed that China and Taiwan net the fewest profits in the sector, while exerting some of the most effort. Russia was also shown to have an unprofitable fishing industry, even with subsidies.However, subsidies weren't just given to unprofitable fishing vessels. The study also found that marginally profitable companies in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and the U.S. had their profits boosted by government subsidies.This boat is fishing for tuna, a species commonly fished out of the high seas.“There are three different categories [of subsidies],” says University of British Columbia economist Rashid Sumaila, one of the study's authors. He and his colleagues began compiling data on fishing subsidies in 2000, and they found that not all subsidies were harmful. Some were ambiguous and hard to categorize. Others were beneficial and went toward activities like sustainable management, research, and regulation enforcement.Other subsidies helped companies increase their carrying capacity—essentially these allowed boats to fish more in fisheries that might be at risk of depletion. Rather than directly providing a fishing company with a check, governments may offer tax breaks, help pay for fuel costs, provide money to upgrade gear, or fund infrastructure like ports.Open ocean outside EEZs, generally 200 miles beyond the shore, is free game. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization outlines a code of conduct on these high seas, but regulation is minimal and enforcement is scant.What's more, vessels often have a competitive interest in not sharing details about their activities.Bottom trawling is one of the most destructive fishing practices. It commonly drags coral from the ocean floor, like this large piece of Paragorgia coral dredged from waters near New Zealand.To compile data for one of the world's most inaccessible regions, marine data scientist and study author Juan Mayorga turned to a program called Global Fishing Watch that tracks vessels from space using the satellite-transmitted signal from AIS—Automatic Identification System—that vessels are required to transmit. Earlier this year, he used the data to find that industrial fishing covers a third of the planet.“When we first came up with this idea, we did not have a good handle on what fishing on the high seas looked like,” says Mayorga. Over a two-year period, he determined how many vessels were operating in the high seas and how often, though he adds that the study's data can't account for all high seas fishing activity. Some vessels forego AIS or turn it off to intentionally be covert.With the data for the ships they could measure, Mayorga used models to estimate fuel costs based on a vessel's size, location, distance traveled, and speed. He could also see the type of vessel and what it was fishing for, which helped him estimate needed labor. Looking at existing information on minimum wage laws and typical cost of labor, Mayorga was able to estimate labor costs on a scale.He notes, however, that this estimate is the least certain part of the study, because reports from several non-governmental organizations show the fishing industry has a history of exploitative labor practices, verging on or directly resulting in slave labor in some regions.“Labor is what drives the uncertainty in our analyses,” he says.With his range of operating costs, Mayorga then estimated the haul each vessel was bringing to market. The study's authors suspect that catch may be underreported in some cases.All-in-all, industrial fishing on the high seas is a relatively small portion of global fishing—accounting for only six percent of all fishing activity. Fishing subsidies in EEZs have been controversial, with the World Trade Organization considering banning them in the past decade. So why subsidize fishing for more expensive fleets that yield smaller returns, the study's authors ask.According to a representative from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, food security is often cited as a major reason for providing subsidies to fishing industries. But a statement published by the agency in 2016 acknowledges a need to regulate subsidies to ensure sustainability.“Fisheries subsidies warrant concern,” says FAO representative Christopher Emsden, adding, “Care is needed as they can serve development purposes in some cases, (although these would likely be for small-scale fishers and not those featuring in the study).”In addition to depleting fisheries, high seas fishing subsidies also threaten important natural habitats, says Sala. Deep-sea bottom trawling, one of more common high-seas fishing practices, is problematic, he notes.“Trawling is one of the most destructive practices on the planet,” says Sala. “They have nets so large they can hold a dozen 747 jets. These huge nets destroy everything in their path, including deep-sea corals. And it would not be profitable without subsidies.”In addition, all three researchers noted that high-seas fishing may perpetuate exploitation.“[Unprofitability] has implications about the extent to which unfair labor practices drive fishing on the high seas,” notes Mayorga.Transparency, whether because industry officials intentionally withheld information or governments lacked records, presented a major hurdle for how researchers comprehensively assessed the high-seas fishing industry.To combat what they say is an economically and environmentally unsound practice, the research team says increasing transparency is key. More stringently enforcing AIS, for example, is one way Sala says regulators could monitor the full impact of high-seas fishing.Sumaila would like to see the World Trade Organization ban or roll back fishing subsidies, but despite extensive discussion at the organization progress has been minimal. The last vote was shot down in December of last year, primarily due to procedural hurdles.In an emailed statement, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo responded to inquiries about high seas fishing subsidies by saying: "Governments of the world have entrusted the WTO with the responsibility of tackling fisheries subsidies that are harmful to our oceans. Last December, at our ministerial conference in Buenos Aires, all WTO members committed to securing a deal on this issue... by the end of 2019, and this work is now well underway. This is one of the important issues of our time. It requires a shared solution. The world is watching."The high seas have sometimes been seen as an avenue for countries to compensate for other overfished waters. China, for instance, has experienced extensive overfishing in its own waters, and a study published in April 2017 found the country trying to compensate by fishing in waters as far as western Africa.Depleting fisheries is a growing problem. Of the 600 fisheries monitored by the FAO, more than half are depleted to the point of yielding little to no catch.Last December, the U.N. also began talks to create a framework to protect high-seas biodiversity. Negotiations are expected to be ongoing for the next two years.The high seas doesn't belong to any one country, which means regional governments often clash during negotiations. In the past, some have objected to long-term changes, hoping to leave the door open to commercial opportunity, while others are worried they may be impacted by declining biodiversity.",
"Unless humans act now, seafood may disappear by 2048, concludes the lead author of a new study that paints a grim picture for ocean and human health.According to the study, the loss of ocean biodiversity is accelerating, and 29 percent of the seafood species humans consume have already crashed. If the long-term trend continues, in 30 years there will be little or no seafood available for sustainable harvest.The increasing pace of diversity loss thus imperils the "ecosystems services" that many human populations depend on for survival, the study says.The research also found that biodiversity loss is tightly linked to declining water quality, harmful algal blooms, ocean dead zones, fish kills, and coastal flooding. (Related: 'Dead Zone' off Oregon Coast Is Growing, Study Says" [August 4, 2006].)"Biodiversity is a finite resource, and we are going to end up with nothing left ... if nothing changes," said Boris Worm, an assistant professor of marine conservation biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.Worm led the international team of scientists and economists that examined the role of marine biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem services. The research appears in tomorrow's issue of the journal Science.But areas managed for improved biodiversity can and do recover, Worm says, raising the possibility that the trend can be reversed if humans take action."Where we [protect marine areas] around the world—from the tropics to temperate ecosystems—we see an increase in species diversity and productivity and stability and economic revenue from those ecosystems," he said.Worm and colleagues examined the impact of species loss at local, regional, and global scales and in a variety of ecosystems.Everywhere they looked, they got the same result: The greater the loss of diversity, the greater the impact on ecosystem services."Ecosystems that were losing species were always more fragile, always more vulnerable, always more likely to see a whole collapse of fisheries, more likely to show an increase in toxic events like fish kills and things like that," Worm said."Whereas those systems that still had a full portfolio of species or had large species diversity to begin with were more robust, better buffered against change."In a telephone briefing with reporters, Worm added that he and his colleagues were "really surprised, to some extent shocked, by the consistency of the result."Worm told National Geographic News that the tight-knit connections between ocean communities and their habitats might explain why species diversity affects ecosystem services so closely.He likened the relationship to a house of cards: Remove one species or habitat type in the system, and the whole thing comes tumbling down.But Donald Boesch at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge is not convinced.In a Science news article on the study, he said "it falls short of demonstrating that biodiversity losses are the primary drivers of why the services have declined."For example, excessive fertilizer runoff into the Chesapeake Bay is most likely behind the decline in water quality there, not loss of biodiversity, he says.But the finding that areas do recover if managed is a major bright spot to the otherwise dark study, Worm says."This can be done. It's not beyond our reach at all," he said.The study recommends an ecosystem management approach that sets aside some zones completely off-limits to any human activity while opening others to certain uses, such as recreation, research, and fishing."It's exactly what we do on land, and we've been doing it for a long time," Worm said.Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, praised the study for presenting compelling evidence that ecosystems can recover if appropriate action is taken.A whale shark swims beside a plastic bag in the Gulf of Aden near Yemen. Although whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, they're still threatened by ingesting small bits of plastic."That said, their first conclusion about the downward spiral [of biodiversity] suggests that the rate of implementation of those recovery tools needs to be sped up quite significantly," she said. But "just making recommendations doesn't make things happen, unfortunately."However, she points to several promising developments, including a proactive movement toward marine reserves and protected areas off the coast of California and Australia's Great Barrier Reef. (Related: "Giant Marine Reserve Created in South Pacific" [March 29, 2006].)She also promotes "catch shares" fisheries management, in which commercial fishers have a stake in maintaining healthy fish populations because they are granted a percentage of the total allowable catch. As more fish are available, the fishers get a larger share."The whole idea is to align fishing and conservation interests so there is incentive for fishermen to conserve stocks so we have something to catch in the future," she said.On the individual level, Worm says, people need to pay attention to what they eat."All of these species end up in our bellies somewhere, so of course we have a lot of control over what is caught and how it is caught," he said. "We need to make informed choices on the fish we eat."",
"As global fish stocks that feed hundreds of millions of people dwindle, nations are scrambling to finalize by year’s end an international agreement to ban government subsidies that fuel overfishing.Yet as negotiations at the World Trade Organization resume this week in Geneva, Switzerland, new research shows that governments have actually increased financial support for fishing practices that decimate marine life, despite public pledges to curtail such handouts.In an exhaustive survey of 152 countries, scientists at the University of British Columbia found that ocean-faring nations spent $22 billion on harmful subsidies in 2018, or 63 percent of the total amount expended to support the global fishing industry.That’s a 6 percent rise since 2009. Harmful subsidies is a term that refers to those that promote overfishing and illegal fishing that would otherwise not be profitable, such as subsidies that underwrite fuel costs allowing industrial trawlers to sail to the farthest reaches of the planet. Fuel subsidies alone accounted for 22 percent of all fishing subsidies last year.China, which operates the world’s largest overseas fishing fleet, has increased harmful subsidies by 105 percent over the past decade, according to the study published in Marine Policy.“It’s hard to take much positive from this study, but it can be a rallying cry for governments as the WTO is in a position to end harmful subsidies and have a huge impact on the ocean,” says Isabel Jarrett, manager of Pew Charitable Trusts’ fishing subsidies program. Pew helped fund the research.The findings underscore the high stakes in Geneva as only three months remain to meet a deadline to hammer out an agreement on fisheries subsidies.Marine scientists and policy experts say a legally binding accord to ban destructive fishing subsidies is critical as climate change disrupts marine ecosystems. A landmark United Nations report issued in September found that the maximum catch from fisheries could decline by as much as 24.1 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.“After 20 years of discussions on fisheries subsidies within the WTO, the discussion on the technical aspects has been pretty much exhausted,” says Rémi Parmentier, director of Madrid-based consultancy the Varda Group and a longtime observer of the negotiations. “The key ingredient that is missing is the political will to push the negotiation to the finish line.”Cod and other commercial ground fish are caught in a net in the Gulf of Maine. Our appetite for fish is wreaking havoc on aquatic populations worldwide. The conservation group World Wildlife Fund predicts that if cod fisheries continue to be fished at current rates, there will be no cod left by 2022. "Seventy-five percent of fisheries are overfished," says marine biologist Enric Sala. "If nothing changes, all fisheries will have collapsed by 2050." The solution, says Sala—a National Geographic Society fellow—is involving all levels of society, from consumers to policy makers. "The solutions exist, we just need the political will to implement them at [a] large scale," he adds.WTO delegates will have the chance to hear firsthand the new study’s findings when lead author Rashid Sumaila makes a presentation this week at the UN organization’s public policy forum.“The key reason subsidies are increasing is politics, as once you give people something like a fuel subsidy it’s very difficult to take it away, ” says Sumaila, a prominent expert on fisheries subsidies at the University of British Columbia. “The politics of this is very hard, but it’s important for scientists to continue to show how this is not working for society.”The WTO's press office said the organization could not comment on the study or the status of the negotiations, but issued a statement from WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo.“There is no question that many fish stocks are being depleted and that unfettered state funding for fishing can harm our oceans,” said Azevêdo in the statement. “With the end-2019 deadline fast approaching, the negotiations are intensifying. WTO members will need to set aside their differences and find compromises to bring about a deal. The time to act is now.”A third of commercial fish stocks are being harvested at biologically unsustainable levels and 90 percent are fully exploited, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. The population of Pacific bluefin tuna, for instance, has plunged 97 percent from historic levels due to rampant overfishing of one of the ocean’s most ecologically and economically valuable top predators.In recent decades, nations whose own fish stocks have collapsed have dispatched industrial trawlers to fish on the high seas and in other countries’ territorial waters.China’s overseas fishing fleet of 3,000 vessels roams the ocean from Africa to the Antarctic to the Pacific. A study last year found nearly half the fish caught on the high seas in 2014 ended up in the holds of Chinese and Taiwanese vessels.The University of British Columbia researchers report that China provides the most subsidies of any nation—some $7.2 billion in 2018, accounting for 21 percent of global support. Some subsidies are considered beneficial, such as those that pay for the sustainable management of fisheries. But over the past decade, money awarded by China for beneficial subsidies fell 73 percent while those considered harmful, such as paying for fuel or boat-building, more than doubled.China late last year pledged to cap its overseas fleet at 3,000 vessels by 2020 and to reduce fuel subsidies. “The traditional development model of offshore fisheries needs to be changed,” the country’s Ministry of Agriculture said in an August 2017 statement.While the study does indicate that subsidy increases may be leveling off, the European Union in June moved to restore subsidies to expand its fishing fleet. The EU already accounts for 11 percent of global subsidies and awarded $2 billion in harmful support in 2018, according to the researchers.“What really bothers me is the example the EU is giving to other countries,” says Sumaila.The fact that 70 countries did not report subsidy data as required by the WTO highlights the challenge in determining the true magnitude of subsidies.“It’s like detective work,” notes Sumaila, whose team dug up data from multiple sources to estimate the extent of financial support for industrial fishing.Jarrett points out that the five countries that issue the most subsidies represent half of total global handouts.“If those countries take on big commitments, then we’ll really see a huge significant shift in moving away from harmful subsidies, and ultimately I hope, rebounding fish stocks and a healthier future for the ocean,” she says.",
"How do you study the world's more widespread predator? By spying from space.When a team of researchers set out to see how prevalent industrial fishing was around the world—who was fishing where and when—they were met with a dearth of information.They lacked access to vessel monitoring systems closely held by regional fishery managers, says Juan Mayorga, a marine data scientist from National Geographic's Pristine Seas project. And that information would have shown only pieces of the puzzle.To circumvent this obstacle, Mayorga and a team of researchers took a step back—way back—and tracked marine vessels from space, using satellites to learn where industrial fishing vessels fished and when.They found the footprint left by the industry was staggering.More than 55 percent of ocean surface is covered by industrial fishing, they found. That's more than four times the area covered by agriculture.Industrial fishing has been responsible for harmful environmental impacts. Overfishing can deplete resources, many animals like dolphins and sea turtles are products of bycatch, and the massive vessels used require large amounts of CO2-producing fuel.But looking at the industry on a global scale may lead to increased transparency and accountability to ensure fisheries are more sustainably managed, the researchers say.The study, published in the journal Science, looked at over 70,000 industrial vessels measuring from six to 146 meters, which encompasses more than 75 percent of the large-scale industry.From 2012 to 2016, researchers watched the ships' movements down to the hour, by sifting through 22 billion signals from ships' automatic identification systems or AIS.AIS was originally created to prevent ship collisions by broadcasting a vessel's identity position, speed, and turning angle every few seconds."Those AIS messages that are broadcasted are publicly available via satellite," says Mayorga. "We then combed through [the signals] with sophisticated computing capabilities provided by Google and machine learning algorithms."From this, says Mayorga, he was able to glean information about the characteristics of each vessel, which revealed what type of fishing was taking place.Longline fishing, a type of fishing in which a line with baited hooks is dropped into the water, was found to be the most prevalent. Trawlers were frequently spotted in the North Sea and off the coast of China.The data also provided useful information by showing activity on the high seas. As opposed to coastal waters under a country's jurisdiction, the high seas are less closely monitored.China, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea accounted for 85 percent of fishing in the high seas."You can't approach getting into the head of a fisherman the same way you can get into the head of a fish," says Douglas McCauley, a marine biologist from the University of California at Santa Barbara who was not involved with the study.Unlike sea animals, the satellite data found humans were less influenced by environmental factors. But that doesn't mean there weren't patterns.Researchers saw a massive dip in activity among Chinese vessels during the Chinese New Year. And they saw a massive dip among other vessels over the Christmas and New Year holidays.As expected, regions that implemented seasonal fishing moratoriums also saw a dip in fishing during those periods.When fuel prices spiked, the study found fishing was largely uninfluenced. McCauley suspects fishing subsidies, funding the World Trade Organization tried but failed to curb last December, are therefore contributing to overfishing.In addition to National Geographic, the study was supported by researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara, Dalhousie University, Stanford University, and Global Fishing Watch (GFW), a collaborative non-profit supported by Oceana, SkyTruth, and Google that aims to increase transparency. (Learn more about SkyTruth.)"The GFW introduces a whole new dimension in the fight against illegal fishing, and for transparency in offshore fishing," says Daniel Pauly, a marine biologist from the University of British Columbia who was not involved with the study.By making the study's data publicly available, the GFW claims low-cost marine reserves can be more easily implemented.Marine reserves act like a bank for fisheries, allowing a healthy stock of fish to flourish in off-limits areas. Conservationists have long argued for implementing more and larger marine reserves, but face opposition from the fishing industry."This [global dataset] makes any decision making or negotiating transparent," says Mayorga.Conservationists say they will be able to prove what regions are less frequented by fishers and already prime to be a reserve."My first job was as a fisherman. You can appreciate how hard that work is," says McCauley. "You see each of those stories locked in a data set. It's an industry that's increasingly important as we confront food security and nutrition shortfalls."He believes that by eliminating fishing subsidies and more strategically regulating fishing on a global scale, it's possible to sustain current levels of fishing without depleting resources."None of this was really possible until we had this database made publicly available," he adds.If conservation measures are applied to industrial fishing, Mayorga sees a role for AIS signals to be used to keep industry accountable."The biggest problem is the traceability of the resources," he says of implementing regulations. "You have to keep track of where the fish is coming from when it lands. That's a big issue for sustainability."His next goal, he says, is to monitor and track smaller ships.",
"Mian Gu Village on China's Nu River is a government housing project designed to encourage people living in the mountains to move down to the river and reduce deforestation.The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change annual report, released this morning, stresses the need to quickly and drastically change how the world manages land.To fight climate change, University of Virginia environmental scientist Deborah Lawrence says sustainable strategies should be less like a silver bullet, narrowly hitting a single target, and more like a silver buckshot, that explodes on impact and scatters pellets in different directions.“Climate change is such a threat, we need to be searching for every possible angle [to fight it],” she says.The IPCC report represents an annual report card and recommendation list for how people, scientists, and policymakers should shape their priorities. Here are the main takeaways from the most recent report.Between extreme weather conditions like droughts and floods, an increasing demand for biofuels, and a growing population, a warming world brings the possibility of a major food crises, the report warns.Increasingly, securing enough food to feed a global population that’s expected to reach 10 billion people by 2050 has become a concern for policymakers. But scientists are now warning that if we continue cutting down forests with abandon to increase food production, climate change will invariably worsen.(You can read more about the looming food crises in this National Geographic article.)Around the world, extreme weather events are severely altering the landscape by eroding coastlines, melting permafrost, and turning once-fruitful soils to dust.An estimated 23 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, it says, are caused by agriculture, food production like raising cattle, and deforestation. Half of the world’s human-made methane—a dangerous greenhouse gas—comes from producing rice and raising cattle.Experts say if we act quickly and ambitiously, we won’t have to choose between forests and food.“The bottom line will be that we need to find better ways to manage what we already have,” says Bruce Stein, chief scientist at the National Wildlife Federation.“A lot of farming historically has almost amounted to mining soil,” he says of what’s required to pave the way for croplands.He points to techniques like regenerative agriculture as a sustainable farming option. The term describes a holistic approach to growing crops that incorporates integrating tree cover, using cover crops, rotating agriculture, and relying on composting to naturally improve farmland topsoil.“We don’t end with fertilizer,” Lawrence says of advancing farming technology.Precision farming is another example of a sustainable farming practice that uses satellite imagery to pinpoint the exact amount of fertilizer and water a crop needs, rather than blanketing a field in water or chemicals.Notably, this IPCC report is the first to recommend bolstering Indigenous land ownership rights as a climate change mitigation strategy.“For the first time, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released today recognizes that securing our rights is a critical solution to the climate crisis,” says a joint statement released today by Indigenous community leaders.Indigenous communities, particularly those in the Amazon, have long struggled to be granted land titles for their homes. The lack of titles creates legal grounds for companies interested in using their land’s resources to claim the land as their own.By strengthening Indigenous rights, the report says forests can be better managed for carbon storage. Indigenous people prevent mining and timber industries from taking root on their lands, and their localized agricultural methods are often more sustainable than those practiced by large companies.Reducing car emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources both help slow the release of emissions. Deforestation, however, not only emits carbon, but it also destroys an important tool—the trees—that helps clean the air of those emissions.The average tree absorbs about 48 pounds of carbon a year, and large swaths of forest like the Amazon rainforest are considered carbon sinks, in that the region stores much more carbon than it emits.That benefit lasts as long as the forest is kept intact, but researchers in Brazil are desperately trying to warn politicians and the public that the region could reach a tipping point. Deforested beyond repair, the Amazon may not be able to recover and could significantly alter the world’s climate.Asking farmers to adopt new farming techniques requires money, and learning new skill sets can be daunting for many.“I think the biggest obstacle is often psychological. People are used to doing things the same way,” Stein says. “Even in the conservation community, we’re very conservative about the way we manage lands, and we’re going to have to reexamine a lot of our practices.”This IPCC report is just one of many research publications saying individuals should change the way they eat to support a healthy planet. Cutting back on eating meat and reducing food waste are two areas the report highlights as a way individuals can live more sustainably.“We should do what we can. There’s no reason to not simply act. We can’t solve the problem, but we can get pretty far,” says Lawrence.She added that if we want to save the planet, civic involvement is critical, especially voting. “You can’t not vote [in elections], and everyone should be thinking about climate change when they vote.”",
"A new reports looks at solutions to ensuring healthy diets for a burgeoning world population while improving the planet.    Here, tomatoes are harvested at a large production facility in the Netherlands.Ensuring healthy diets for an expected global population of nearly 10 billion people in 2050, while at the same time improving the world those people live in, will require sweeping changes to farming and how we produce food, according to a new report.“There is a pathway to achieve this but the challenge is even bigger than any of us thought,” said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and co-author of “Creating A Sustainable Food Future: Final Report.”Agriculture already uses almost half of the world’s vegetated land. It consumes 90 percent of all the water used by humanity and generates one-quarter of the annual global emissions that are causing global warming. And yet of the seven billion people living today, 820 million are undernourished because they don’t have access to—or can’t afford—an adequate diet.“We have to produce 30 percent more food on the same land area, stop deforestation, [and] cut carbon emissions for food production by two-thirds,” says Waite in an interview.All of that must be done while reducing poverty levels and the loss of natural habitat, preventing freshwater depletion, and cutting pollution as well as other environmental impacts of farming.“There is no silver bullet; To prevent more land from being converted into agriculture requires major improvements in feed quality and grazing management. It also requires finding ways to get more than one crop harvest per year, and requires better crop breeding techniques. For example, CRISP-R technology enables the fine tuning of genes to maximize yields. we need to do everything,” Waite says.The “everything” Waite referred to are 22 solutions detailed in the 565 page report, all of which need to be implemented to some degree, depending on the country and region. Here are a few of the proposed solutions:• Dramatically reduce the estimated one-third of food that is lost or wasted. From scaling up solar-powered cold-storage units on farms, to using natural compounds that inhibit bacterial growth and retain water in the fruit in order to extend shelf life at retail stores, improvements can be made all along the supply chain.• Shift the diets of high-meat consumers toward plant-based foods. Meat, particularly from cattle, sheep, and goats, is very resource intensive. For growing populations to have access to some meat, others will have to consume less. There are now burgers made up of 20 to 35 percent mushroom and all-plant burgers that taste as good as, if not superior to, all-beef burgers, the report notes. It also says governments provide nearly $600 billion in annual subsidies to agriculture and those that favor meat and dairy production should be phased out.• Boost crop yields and dramatically increase the output of milk and meat. To prevent more land from being used for agriculture will need major improvements in feed quality and grazing management. It also requires finding ways to get more than one crop harvest per year, which in turn will require better crop breeding techniques. For example, CRISP-R technology enables the fine tuning of genes to maximize yields.• Improve wild fisheries management and aquaculture. Overfishing can be reduced by eliminating much of the $35 billion in annual global fisheries subsidies. Certification and better enforcement to eliminate illegal and unreported fishing could save an estimated 11 to 26 million tons of fish lost to it. Aquaculture can include the use of algae, seaweed, or oil seeds-based fish foods rather than relying on small fish to feed larger ones like salmon.“I don’t think the report truly represents the transformative change that the global food system needs to undergo,” says Hans Herren, President of the Washington-based Millennium Institute and winner of the World Food Prize for his work as an entomologist.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS), among others, endorse a so-called agroecological approach to food production, but the WRI report doesn’t mention it, Herren said in an interview.Agroecology mimics nature, replacing the external inputs like chemical fertilizer with knowledge of how a combination of plants, trees, and animals can enhance the productivity of land.The CFS just released its own report looking at the issue of how to feed the world sustainably. It said agroecology encompasses whole agriculture and food systems from production to consumption and was increasingly seen as the way forward to create sustainable food systems. However, the report acknowledges that agriculture is extremely diverse and what works in one place may not in another.Although the term agroecology isn’t used in WRI’s report, some of the solutions could be called that, said Waite. “I think overemphasis on agroecology as ‘the’ solution crowds out the very real needs for also advancing technological innovation,” he says.Pollinators—the bees and other insects that pollinate food crops—are also largely missing in the WRI report. It does note that warmer temperatures are likely to cause early flower blooming before pollinators arrive, which reduces crop yields.A larger concern is the growing lack of crop diversity in agriculture, which is often dominated by crops such as corn and soy. That puts pollinators at risk, a new study in Global Change Biology warns, because it severely limits their opportunity for nutrition. It recommends cultivating a variety of crops that bloom at different times to provide a more stable source of food and habitat for pollinators.There isn’t a great deal new in the WRI report, said Danielle Nierenberg, President and Founder of Food Tank, a U.S. non-profit looking at solutions and environmentally sustainable ways of alleviating hunger, obesity, and poverty.“I like the fact there are concrete messages with lots of useful ideas about the ways forward,” Nierenberg says in an interview.Many of these are things we can do now to move to sustainable food production and things that will create more jobs and economic growth, she said.Specifics aside, the world must act decisively, wrote Andrew Steer, president of the WRI, in the forward of the new report.“Food production and ecosystem protection must be linked at every level—policy, finance, and farm practice—to avoid destructive competition for precious land and water,” Steer says.",
"Modern farming techniques and innovations like crop protection, selective breeding and artificial fertilizer have helped us to supply the demand, but with the population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, we need the next wave of innovations to ensure the right balance between producing more food and sustaining the planet. Here are five ways that farming could change the world for the better.Digital farming is a rapidly growing industry. Drones are becoming more accessible and sophisticated, fitted with high-resolution cameras that provide real-time images of crops and livestock. They could also be designed to deliver precise interactions such as water and nutrients to needy areas or weed killer and pest control to specific plants. Teams of agrobots may be the key to micro-managing vast areas of farmland. Such autonomous robots could be equipped to inspect, sow, water, treat, and even harvest crops. Each agrobot would make independent micro-decisions as it moves between individual plants, communicating useful information to the rest of its team and utilizing it through machine-learning. This technology gives crops an exceptional level of attention that could help to maximize yield and minimize waste.Drones and agrobots will form part of an ever-increasing number of digital sensors, handheld devices, and wearables that will gather detailed information on everything from soil health and crop growth, to weather patterns, to the welfare and productivity of each animal. Future farms are likely to generate enormous volumes of data, using complex Big Data algorithms to gain meaningful insights that drive decision making. Together with a farmer’s hard-earned experience, Big Data will advise on what crops grow where, what interventions may be needed, the optimum moment to harvest, and even the best times to store and sell. This constant analysis gives farmers unprecedented control over increasingly large areas of land.As climate change brings more extreme and unpredictable weather, greenhouses will help mitigate the worst effects by regulating the temperature, water, and nutrition of crops in a closed agricultural system. They are already extensively used for growing fruit and vegetables in cooler climates: the Netherlands is famous for its greenhouse complexes that can cover up to 175 acres. These could be used to make vast swathes of otherwise marginal land such as deserts, productive all year round, allowing farming in ever more extreme conditions. Here, solar panels could generate electricity to keep greenhouses at optimum temperatures and to desalinate water for irrigation. Built of specialist materials, greenhouses could absorb the sun’s light but reflect its heat, while protecting fragile crops from extremes such as strong winds, torrential rainfall, and disease. Even simple plastic greenhouses can triple crop yields in areas prone to pests and drought.Healthy crops need healthy soil, and future farms will have to prioritize sustainable practices if they are to maintain productivity, let alone increase it. Simple solutions such as cover crops, mulches, and compost could play a crucial role in conserving water and building up nutrients in the soil, especially in more marginal land. Precision farming will significantly reduce the amount of fertilizer and pesticide required for effective treatment and customized blends can be tailored to meet any soil’s needs. Soil mapping could accurately match plants and earth types so that multiple crops can be successfully grown in a single field, making for more balanced demands on its nutrients. The development of perennial cereals that don’t need to be replanted each year will promote a healthier and more stable soil structure. Meanwhile, genetic sequencing is identifying microbes that can help plants use nutrients more effectively and speed up the soil’s recovery back to fertility.It’s not only how we grow food that matters, what foods we grow could make a decisive difference. Only around 55% of the world’s crop calories directly feed people—about 36% is used to feed livestock. But for every 100 calories of grain we feed animals we only get 40 new calories of milk, 12 calories of chicken, 10 of pork, or 3 of beef. Meat is an excellent source of protein and vitamins, but it is a relatively inefficient calorific delivery system. It’s estimated that with current levels of food production we already produce enough calories to feed nine billion people if we eat less meat and switch to a more vegetarian diet. It’s likely that responsible genetic modifications will not only make crops more robust but could also be engineered for greater yields and nutritional value.We asked some big questions about living a better life.

"Stung by soaring food prices, angry Egyptians throng a kiosk selling government-subsidized bread near the Great Pyramid at Giza. Across the globe, rising demand and flat supplies have rekindled the old debate over whether production can keep up with population.It is the simplest, most natural of acts, akin to breathing and walking upright. We sit down at the dinner table, pick up a fork, and take a juicy bite, obliv­ious to the double helping of global ramifications on our plate. Our beef comes from Iowa, fed by Nebraska corn. Our grapes come from Chile, our bananas from Honduras, our olive oil from Sicily, our apple juice—not from Washington State but all the way from China. Modern society has relieved us of the burden of growing, harvesting, even preparing our daily bread, in exchange for the burden of simply paying for it. Only when prices rise do we take notice. And the consequences of our inattention are profound.Last year the skyrocketing cost of food was a wake-up call for the planet. Between 2005 and the summer of 2008, the price of wheat and corn tripled, and the price of rice climbed fivefold, spurring food riots in nearly two dozen countries and pushing 75 million more people into poverty. But unlike previous shocks driven by short-term food shortages, this price spike came in a year when the world's farmers reaped a record grain crop. This time, the high prices were a symptom of a larger problem tugging at the strands of our worldwide food web, one that's not going away anytime soon. Simply put: For most of the past decade, the world has been consuming more food than it has been producing. After years of drawing down stockpiles, in 2007 the world saw global carryover stocks fall to 61 days of global consumption, the second lowest on record."Agricultural productivity growth is only one to two percent a year," warned Joachim von Braun, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., at the height of the crisis. "This is too low to meet population growth and increased demand."High prices are the ultimate signal that demand is outstripping supply, that there is simply not enough food to go around. Such agflation hits the poorest billion people on the planet the hardest, since they typically spend 50 to 70 percent of their income on food. Even though prices have fallen with the imploding world economy, they are still near record highs, and the underlying problems of low stockpiles, rising population, and flattening yield growth remain. Climate change—with its hotter growing seasons and increasing water scarcity—is projected to reduce future harvests in much of the world, raising the specter of what some scientists are now calling a perpetual food crisis.So what is a hot, crowded, and hungry world to do?That's the question von Braun and his colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research are wrestling with right now. This is the group of world-renowned agricultural research centers that helped more than double the world's average yields of corn, rice, and wheat between the mid-1950s and the mid-1990s, an achievement so staggering it was dubbed the green revolution. Yet with world population spiraling toward nine billion by mid-century, these experts now say we need a repeat performance, doubling current food production by 2030.In other words, we need another green revolution. And we need it in half the time.Ever since our ancestors gave up hunting and gathering for plowing and planting some 12,000 years ago, our numbers have marched in lock­­step with our agricultural prowess. Each advance—the domestication of animals, irrigation, wet rice production—led to a corresponding jump in human population. Every time food supplies plateaued, population eventually leveled off. Early Arab and Chinese writers noted the relationship between population and food resources, but it wasn't until the end of the 18th century that a British scholar tried to explain the exact mechanism linking the two—and became perhaps the most vilified social scientist in history.Thomas Robert Malthus, the namesake of such terms as "Malthusian collapse" and "Malthusian curse," was a mild-mannered mathematician, a clergyman—and, his critics would say, the ultimate glass-half-empty kind of guy. When a few Enlightenment philosophers, giddy from the success of the French Revolution, began predicting the continued unfettered improvement of the human condition, Malthus cut them off at the knees. Human population, he observed, increases at a geometric rate, doubling about every 25 years if unchecked, while agricultural production increases arithmetically—much more slowly. Therein lay a biological trap that humanity could never escape."The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man," he wrote in his Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. "This implies a strong and constantly operating check on population from the difficulty of subsistence." Malthus thought such checks could be voluntary, such as birth control, abstinence, or delayed marriage—or involuntary, through the scourges of war, famine, and disease. He advocated against food relief for all but the poorest of people, since he felt such aid encouraged more children to be born into misery. That tough love earned him a nasty cameo in English literature from none other than Charles Dickens. When Ebenezer Scrooge is asked to give alms for the poor in A Christmas Carol, the heartless banker tells the do-gooders that the destitute should head for the workhouses or prisons. And if they'd rather die than go there, "they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population."The industrial revolution and plowing up of the English commons dramatically increased the amount of food in England, sweeping Malthus into the dustbin of the Victorian era. But it was the green revolution that truly made the reverend the laughingstock of modern economists. From 1950 to today the world has experienced the largest population growth in human history. After Malthus's time, six billion people were added to the planet's dinner tables. Yet thanks to improved methods of grain production, most of those people were fed. We'd finally shed Malthusian limits for good.Or so we thought.On the 15th night of the ninth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, 3,680 villagers, nearly all with the surname "He," sat beneath a leaking tarp in the square of Yaotian, China, and dived into a 13-course meal. The event was a traditional banquet in honor of their elders. Tureens of steaming soup floated past, followed by rapidly dwindling platters of noodles, rice, fish, shrimp, steamed vegetables, dim sum, duck, chicken, lily root, pigeon, black fungus, and pork cooked more ways than I could count.Even with the global recession, times are still relatively good in the southeastern province of Guangdong, where Yaotian sits tucked between postage-stamp garden plots and block after block of new factories that helped make the province one of the most prosperous in China. When times are good, the Chinese eat pigs. Lots of pigs. Per capita pork consumption in the world's most populous country went up 45 percent between 1993 and 2005, from 53 to 77 pounds a year.An affable businessman in a pink-striped polo shirt, pork-industry consultant Shen Guang­rong remembers his father raising one pig each year, which was slaughtered at the Chinese New Year. It would be their only meat for the year. The pigs Shen's father raised were pretty low maintenance—hardy black-and-white varieties that would eat almost anything: food scraps, roots, garbage. Not so China's modern pigs. After the deadly protests of Tiananmen Square in 1989, which topped off a year of political unrest exacerbated by high food prices, the government started offering tax incentives to large industrial farms to meet the growing demand. Shen was assigned to work at one of China's first pig CAFOs, or concentrated animal feeding operations, in nearby Shenzhen. Such farms, which have proliferated in recent years, depend on breeds that are fed high-tech mixtures of corn, soy meal, and supplements to keep them growing fast.That's good news for the average pork-loving Chinese—who still eats only about 40 percent as much meat as consumers in the U.S. But it's worrisome for the world's grain supplies. It's no coincidence that as countries like China and India prosper and their people move up the food ladder, demand for grain has increased. For as tasty as that sweet-and-sour pork may be, eating meat is an incredibly inefficient way to feed oneself. It takes up to five times more grain to get the equivalent amount of calories from eating pork as from simply eating grain itself—ten times if we're talking about grain-fattened U.S. beef. As more grain has been diverted to livestock and to the production of biofuels for cars, annual worldwide consumption of grain has risen from 815 million metric tons in 1960 to 2.16 billion in 2008. Since 2005, the mad rush to biofuels alone has pushed grain-consumption growth from about 20 million tons annually to 50 million tons, according to Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute.Even China, the second largest corn-growing nation on the planet, can't grow enough grain to feed all its pigs. Most of the shortfall is made up with imported soybeans from the U.S. or Brazil, one of the few countries with the potential to expand its cropland—often by plowing up rain forest. Increasing demand for food, feed, and bio­fuels has been a major driver of deforestation in the tropics. Between 1980 and 2000 more than half of new cropland acreage in the tropics was carved out of intact rain forests; Brazil alone increased its soybean acreage in Amazonia 10 percent a year from 1990 to 2005.Some of those Brazilian soybeans may end up in the troughs of Guangzhou Lizhi Farms, the largest CAFO in Guangdong Province. Tucked into a green valley just off a four-lane highway that's still being built, some 60 white hog houses are scattered around large ponds, part of the waste-treatment system for 100,000 hogs. The city of Guangzhou is also building a brand-new meatpacking plant that will slaughter 5,000 head a day. By the time China has 1.5 billion people, sometime in the next 20 years, some experts predict they'll need another 200 million hogs just to keep up. And that's just China. World meat consumption is expected to double by 2050. That means we're going to need a whole lot more grain.This isn't the first time the world has stood at the brink of a food crisis—it's only the most recent iteration. At 83, Gurcharan Singh Kalkat has lived long enough to remember one of the worst famines of the 20th century. In 1943 as many as four million people died in the "Malthusian correction" known as the Bengal Famine. For the following two decades, India had to import millions of tons of grain to feed its people.Then came the green revolution. In the mid-1960s, as India was struggling to feed its people during yet another crippling drought, an American plant breeder named Norman Borlaug was working with Indian researchers to bring his high-yielding wheat varieties to Punjab. The new seeds were a godsend, says Kal­kat, who was deputy director of agriculture for Punjab at the time. By 1970, farmers had nearly tripled their production with the same amount of work. "We had a big problem with what to do with the surplus," says Kalkat. "We closed schools one month early to store the wheat crop in the buildings."Borlaug was born in Iowa and saw his mission as spreading the high-yield farming methods that had turned the American Midwest into the world's breadbasket to impoverished places throughout the world. His new dwarf wheat varieties, with their short, stocky stems supporting full, fat seed heads, were a startling breakthrough. They could produce grain like no other wheat ever seen—as long as there was plenty of water and synthetic fertilizer and little competition from weeds or insects. To that end, the Indian government subsidized canals, fertilizer, and the drilling of tube wells for irrigation and gave farmers free electricity to pump the water. The new wheat varieties quickly spread throughout Asia, changing the traditional farming practices of millions of farmers, and were soon followed by new strains of "miracle" rice. The new crops matured faster and enabled farmers to grow two crops a year instead of one. Today a double crop of wheat, rice, or cotton is the norm in Punjab, which, with neighboring Haryana, recently supplied more than 90 percent of the wheat needed by grain-deficient states in India.The green revolution Borlaug started had nothing to do with the eco-friendly green label in vogue today. With its use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to nurture vast fields of the same crop, a practice known as monoculture, this new method of industrial farming was the antithesis of today's organic trend. Rather, William S. Gaud, then administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, coined the phrase in 1968 to describe an alternative to Russia's red revolution, in which workers, soldiers, and hungry peasants had rebelled violently against the tsarist government. The more pacifying green revolution was such a staggering success that Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.Today, though, the miracle of the green revolution is over in Punjab: Yield growth has essentially flattened since the mid-1990s. Overirrigation has led to steep drops in the water table, now tapped by 1.3 million tube wells, while thousands of hectares of productive land have been lost to salinization and waterlogged soils. Forty years of intensive irrigation, fertilization, and pesticides have not been kind to the loamy gray fields of Punjab. Nor, in some cases, to the people themselves.In the dusty farming village of Bhuttiwala, home to some 6,000 people in the Muktsar district, village elder Jagsir Singh, in flowing beard and cobalt turban, adds up the toll: "We've had 49 deaths due to cancer in the last four years," he says. "Most of them were young people. The water is not good. It's poisonous, contaminated water. Yet people still drink it."Walking through the narrow dirt lanes past pyramids of dried cow dung, Singh introduces Amarjeet Kaur, a slender 40-year-old who for years drew the family's daily water from a hand pump in their brick-hard compound. She was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. Tej Kaur, 50, also has breast cancer. Her surgery, she says, wasn't nearly as painful as losing her seven-year-old grandson to "blood cancer," or leukemia. Jagdev Singh is a sweet-faced 14-year-old boy whose spine is slowly deteriorating. From his wheelchair, he is watching SpongeBob SquarePants dubbed in Hindi as his father discusses his prognosis. "The doctors say he will not live to see 20," says Bhola Singh.There's no proof these cancers were caused by pesticides. But researchers have found pesticides in the Punjabi farmers' blood, their water table, their vegetables, even their wives' breast milk. So many people take the train from the Malwa region to the cancer hospital in Bikaner that it's now called the Cancer Express. The government is concerned enough to spend millions on reverse-osmosis water-treatment plants for the worst affected villages.If that weren't worrisome enough, the high cost of fertilizers and pesticides has plunged many Punjabi farmers into debt. One study found more than 1,400 cases of farmer suicides in 93 villages between 1988 and 2006. Some groups put the total for the state as high as 40,000 to 60,000 suicides over that period. Many drank pesticides or hung themselves in their fields."The green revolution has brought us only downfall," says Jarnail Singh, a retired schoolteacher in Jajjal village. "It ruined our soil, our environment, our water table. Used to be we had fairs in villages where people would come together and have fun. Now we gather in medical centers. The government has sacrificed the people of Punjab for grain."Others, of course, see it differently. Rattan Lal, a noted soil scientist at Ohio State who graduated from Punjab Agricultural University in 1963, believes it was the abuse—not the use—of green revolution technologies that caused most of the problems. That includes the overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation and the removal of all crop residues from the fields, essentially strip-mining soil nutrients. "I realize the problems of water quality and water withdrawal," says Lal. "But it saved hundreds of millions of people. We paid a price in water, but the choice was to let people die."In terms of production, the benefits of the green revolution are hard to deny. India hasn't experienced famine since Borlaug brought his seeds to town, while world grain production has more than doubled. Some scientists credit increased rice yields alone with the existence of 700 million more people on the planet.Many crop scientists and farmers believe the solution to our current food crisis lies in a second green revolution, based largely on our newfound knowledge of the gene. Plant breeders now know the sequence of nearly all of the 50,000 or so genes in corn and soybean plants and are using that knowledge in ways that were unimaginable only four or five years ago, says Robert Fraley, chief technology officer for the agricultural giant Monsanto. Fraley is convinced that genetic modification, which allows breeders to bolster crops with beneficial traits from other species, will lead to new varie­ties with higher yields, reduced fertilizer needs, and drought tolerance—the holy grail for the past decade. He believes biotech will make it possible to double yields of Monsanto's core crops of corn, cotton, and soybeans by 2030. "We're now poised to see probably the greatest period of fundamental scientific advance in the history of agriculture."Africa is the continent where Homo sapiens was born, and with its worn-out soils, fitful rain, and rising population, it could very well offer a glimpse of our species' future. For numerous reasons—lack of infrastructure, corruption, inaccessible markets—the green revolution never made it here. Agricultural production per capita actually declined in sub-Saharan Africa between 1970 and 2000, while the population soared, leaving an average ten-million-ton annual food deficit. It's now home to more than a quarter of the world's hungriest people.Tiny, landlocked Malawi, dubbed the "warm heart of Africa" by a hopeful tourism industry, is also in the hungry heart of Africa, a poster child for the continent's agricultural ills. Living in one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in Africa, the majority of Malawians are corn farmers who eke out a living on less than two dollars a day. In 2005 the rains failed once again in Malawi, and more than a third of its population of 13 million required food aid to survive. Malawi's President Bingu wa Mutharika declared he did not get elected to rule a nation of beggars. After initially failing to persuade the World Bank and other donors to help subsidize green revolution inputs, Bingu, as he's known here, decided to spend $58 million from the country's own coffers to get hybrid seeds and fertilizers into the hands of poor farmers. The World Bank eventually got on board and persuaded Bingu to target the subsidy to the poorest farmers. About 1.3 million farm families received coupons that allowed them to buy three kilograms of hybrid corn seed and two 50-kilogram bags of fertilizer at a third of the market price.What happened next has been called the Malawi Miracle. Good seed and a little fertilizer—and the return of soil-soaking rains—helped farmers reap bumper crops for the next two years. (Last year's harvests, however, were slightly down.) The 2007 harvest was estimated to be 3.44 million metric tons, a national record. "They went from a 44 percent deficit to an 18 percent surplus, doubling their production," says Pedro Sanchez, the director of the Tropical Agriculture Program at Columbia University who advised the Malawi government on the program. "The next year they had a 53 percent surplus and exported maize to Zimbabwe. It was a dramatic change."So dramatic, in fact, that it has led to an increasing awareness of the importance of agricultural investment in reducing poverty and hunger in places like Malawi. In October 2007 the World Bank issued a critical report, concluding that the agency, international donors, and African governments had fallen short in helping Africa's poor farmers and had neglected investment in agriculture for the previous 15 years. After decades of discouraging public investment in agriculture and calling for market-based solutions that rarely materialized, institutions like the World Bank have reversed course and pumped funds into agriculture over the past two years.Malawi's subsidy program is part of a larger movement to bring the green revolution, at long last, to Africa. Since 2006 the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have ponied up nearly half a billion dollars to fund the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, focused primarily on bringing plant-breeding programs to African universities and enough fertilizer to farmers' fields. Columbia's Sanchez, along with über-economist and poverty warrior Jeffrey Sachs, is providing concrete examples of the benefits of such investment in 80 small villages clustered into about a dozen "Millennium Villages" scattered in hunger hot spots throughout Africa. With the help of a few rock stars and A-list actors, Sanchez and Sachs are spending $300,000 a year on each small village. That's one-third as much per person as Malawi's per capita GDP, leading many in the development community to wonder if such a program can be sustained over the long haul.Phelire Nkhoma, a small whipcord of a woman, is the agricultural extension officer for one of Malawi's two Millennium Villages—actually seven villages with a total of 35,000 people. She describes the program as we ride in a new UN pickup from her office in Zomba District through fire-blackened fields dotted with the violet flush of jacaranda trees. Villagers get hybrid seeds and fertilizers for free—as long as they donate three bags of corn at harvesttime to a school feeding program. They get bed nets and antimalarial drugs. They get a clinic staffed with health workers, a gra­nary to store their harvests, and safe-drinking-water wells within a kilometer of each household. Good primary schools, improved road systems, and connection to the power grid and the Internet are on the way in these villages, and in the "Madonna" village, which is farther north."The Madonna?" I asked."Yes. I hear she's divorcing her latest husband. Is that true?"Good times are apparent in the Millennium Village, where Nkhoma shows me new brick houses topped with shiny corrugated-steel roofs, a grain bank full of seed and fertilizer, and beneath a shade tree, a hundred or more villagers patiently listening to a banker explaining how they can apply for an agricultural loan. Several are queued up at the teller window of an armored truck from Opportunity International Bank of Malawi. Cosmas Chimwara, a 30-year-old cabbage seller, is one of them. "The cabbage business is going well," he says. "I have three bikes, a TV and mobile phone, and a better house."Such stories warm the heart of Faison Tipoti, the village leader who was instrumental in bringing the famous project here. "When Jeff Sachs came and asked, 'What do you want?' we said not money, not flour, but give us fertilizer and hybrid seed, and he will do a good thing," says Tipoti in a deep voice. No longer do villagers spend their days walking the road begging others for food to feed children with swollen bellies and sickness. He gazes over to where several children are frolicking as they wash clothes and gather water at the new village well. "With the coming of the project, everywhere is clear, fresh water," Tipoti says.But is a reprise of the green revolution—with the traditional package of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation, supercharged by genetically engineered seeds—really the answer to the world's food crisis? Last year a massive study called the "International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development" concluded that the immense production increases brought about by science and technology in the past 30 years have failed to improve food access for many of the world's poor. The six-year study, initiated by the World Bank and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and involving some 400 agricultural experts from around the globe, called for a paradigm shift in agriculture toward more sustainable and ecologically friendly practices that would benefit the world's 900 million small farmers, not just agribusiness.The green revolution's legacy of tainted soil and depleted aquifers is one reason to look for new strategies. So is what author and University of California, Berkeley, professor Michael Pollan calls the Achilles heel of current green revolution methods: a dependence on fossil fuels. Natural gas, for example, is a raw material for nitrogen fertilizers. "The only way you can have one farmer feed 140 Americans is with monocultures. And monocultures need lots of fossil-fuel-based fertilizers and lots of fossil-fuel-based pesticides," Pollan says. "That only works in an era of cheap fossil fuels, and that era is coming to an end. Moving anyone to a dependence on fossil fuels seems the height of irresponsibility."So far, genetic breakthroughs that would free green revolution crops from their heavy dependence on irrigation and fertilizer have proved elusive. Engineering plants that can fix their own nitrogen or are resistant to drought "has proven a lot harder than they thought," says Pollan. Monsanto's Fraley predicts his company will have drought-tolerant corn in the U.S. market by 2012. But the increased yields promised during drought years are only 6 to 10 percent above those of standard drought-hammered crops.And so a shift has already begun to small, underfunded projects scattered across Africa and Asia. Some call it agroecology, others sustainable agriculture, but the underlying idea is revolutionary: that we must stop focusing on simply maximizing grain yields at any cost and consider the environmental and social impacts of food production. Vandana Shiva is a nuclear physicist turned agroecologist who is India's harshest critic of the green revolution. "I call it monocultures of the mind," she says. "They just look at yields of wheat and rice, but overall the food basket is going down. There were 250 kinds of crops in Punjab before the green revolution." Shiva argues that small-scale, biologically diverse farms can produce more food with fewer petroleum-based inputs. Her research has shown that using compost instead of natural-gas-derived fertilizer increases organic matter in the soil, sequestering carbon and holding moisture—two key advantages for farmers facing climate change. "If you are talking about solving the food crisis, these are the methods you need," adds Shiva.In northern Malawi one project is getting many of the same results as the Millennium Villages project, at a fraction of the cost. There are no hybrid corn seeds, free fertilizers, or new roads here in the village of Ekwendeni. Instead the Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC) project distributes legume seeds, recipes, and technical advice for growing nutritious crops like peanuts, pigeon peas, and soybeans, which enrich the soil by fixing nitrogen while also enriching children's diets. The program began in 2000 at Ekwendeni Hospital, where the staff was seeing high rates of malnutrition. Research suggested the culprit was the corn monoculture that had left small farmers with poor yields due to depleted soils and the high price of fertilizer.The project's old pickup needs a push to get it going, but soon Boyd Zimba, the project's assistant coordinator, and Zacharia Nkhonya, its food-security supervisor, are rattling down the road, talking about what they see as the downside of the Malawi Miracle. "First, the fertilizer subsidy cannot last long," says Nkhonya, a compact man with a quick smile. "Second, it doesn't go to everyone. And third, it only comes once a year, while legumes are long-term—soils get improved every year, unlike with fertilizers."At the small village of Encongolweni, a group of two dozen SFHC farmers greet us with a song about the dishes they make from soybeans and pigeon peas. We sit in their meetinghouse as if at an old-time tent revival, as they testify about how planting legumes has changed their lives. Ackim Mhone's story is typical. By incorporating legumes into his rotation, he's doubled his corn yield on his small plot of land while cutting his fertilizer use in half. "That was enough to change the life of my family," Mhone says, and to enable him to improve his house and buy livestock. Later, Alice Sumphi, a 67-year-old farmer with a mischievous smile, dances in her plot of young knee-high tomatoes, proudly pointing out that they bested those of the younger men. Canadian researchers found that after eight years, the children of more than 7,000 families involved in the project showed significant weight increases, making a pretty good case that soil health and community health are connected in Malawi.Which is why the project's research coordinator, Rachel Bezner Kerr, is alarmed that big-money foundations are pushing for a new green revolution in Africa. "I find it deeply disturbing," she says. "It's getting farmers to rely on expensive inputs produced from afar that are making money for big companies rather than on agroecological methods for using local resources and skills. I don't think that's the solution."Regardless of which model prevails—agriculture as a diverse ecological art, as a high-tech industry, or some combination of the two—the challenge of putting enough food in nine billion mouths by 2050 is daunting. Two billion people already live in the driest parts of the globe, and climate change is projected to slash yields in these regions even further. No matter how great their yield potential, plants still need water to grow. And in the not too distant future, every year could be a drought year for much of the globe.New climate studies show that extreme heat waves, such as the one that withered crops and killed thousands in western Europe in 2003, are very likely to become common in the tropics and subtropics by century's end. Himalayan glaciers that now provide water for hundreds of millions of people, livestock, and farmland in China and India are melting faster and could vanish completely by 2035. In the worst-case scenario, yields for some grains could decline by 10 to 15 percent in South Asia by 2030. Projections for southern Africa are even more dire. In a region already racked by water scarcity and food insecurity, the all-important corn harvest could drop by 30 percent—47 percent in the worst-case scenario. All the while the population clock keeps ticking, with a net of 2.5 more mouths to feed born every second. That amounts to 4,500 more mouths in the time it takes you to read this article.Which leads us, inevitably, back to Malthus.On a brisk fall day that has put color into the cheeks of the most die-hard Londoners, I visit the British Library and check out the first edition of the book that still generates such heated debate. Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population looks like an eighth-grade science primer. From its strong, clear prose comes the voice of a humble parish priest who hoped, as much as anything, to be proved wrong."People who say Malthus is wrong usually haven't read him," says Tim Dyson, a professor of population studies at the London School of Economics. "He was not taking a view any different than what Adam Smith took in the first volume of The Wealth of Nations. No one in their right mind doubts the idea that populations have to live within their resource base. And that the capacity of society to increase resources from that base is ultimately limited."Though his essays emphasized "positive checks" on population from famine, disease, and war, his "preventative checks" may have been more important. A growing workforce, Malthus explained, depresses wages, which tends to make people delay marriage until they can better support a family. Delaying marriage reduces fertility rates, creating an equally powerful check on populations. It has now been shown that this is the basic mechanism that regulated population growth in western Europe for some 300 years before the industrial revolution—a pretty good record for any social scientist, says Dyson.Yet when Britain recently issued a new 20-pound note, it put Adam Smith on the back, not T. R. Malthus. He doesn't fit the ethos of the moment. We don't want to think about limits. But as we approach nine billion people on the planet, all clamoring for the same opportunities, the same lifestyles, the same hamburgers, we ignore them at our risk.None of the great classical economists saw the industrial revolution coming, or the transformation of economies and agriculture that it would bring about. The cheap, readily available energy contained in coal—and later in other fossil fuels—unleashed the greatest increase in food, personal wealth, and people the world has ever seen, enabling Earth's population to increase sevenfold since Malthus's day. And yet hunger, famine, and malnutrition are with us still, just as Malthus said they would be."Years ago I was working with a Chinese demographer," Dyson says. "One day he pointed out to me the two Chinese characters above his office door that spelled the word 'population.' You had the character for a person and the character for an open mouth. It really struck me. Ultimately there has to be a balance between population and resources. And this notion that we can continue to grow forever, well it's ridiculous."Perhaps somewhere deep in his crypt in Bath Abbey, Malthus is quietly wagging a bony finger and saying, "Told you so."",
"A Colombia banana plantation exports 200 tons a week, while 17 tons stay behind in a compost pile. They don’t meet specifications set by mostly U.S. and EU buyers: they must be a minimum of eight inches, though some brands accept them down to 6.5. Many more are rejected because they are too curved, too short, too thin, or have minor blemishes.With governments fretting over how to feed more than nine billion people by 2050, a dominant narrative calls for increasing global food production by 70 to 100 percent. But agriculture already represents one of the greatest threats to planetary health. It is responsible for 70 percent of the planet’s freshwater withdrawals, 80 percent of the world’s tropical and subtropical deforestation, and 30 to 35 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.Meanwhile, nearly 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger. But according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we squander enough food—globally, 2.9 trillion pounds a year—to feed every one of them more than twice over. Where’s all that food—about a third of the planet’s production—going?In developing nations much is lost postharvest for lack of adequate storage facilities, good roads, and refrigeration. In comparison, developed nations waste more food farther down the supply chain, when retailers order, serve, or display too much and when consumers ignore leftovers in the back of the fridge or toss perishables before they’ve expired.Imperfect oranges are separated from others during harvest in Peru. Globally, 46 percent of fruits and vegetables never make it from farm to table.Wasting food takes an environmental toll as well. Producing food that no one eats—whether sausages or snickerdoodles—also squanders the water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, fuel, and land needed to grow it. The quantities aren’t trivial.Globally a year’s production of uneaten food guzzles as much water as the entire annual flow of the Volga, Europe’s most voluminous river. Growing the 133 billion pounds of food that retailers and consumers discard in the United States annually slurps the equivalent of more than 70 times the amount of oil lost in the Gulf of Mexico’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, according to American Wasteland author Jonathan Bloom. These staggering numbers don’t even include the losses from farms, fishing vessels, and slaughterhouses.If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world, after China and the U.S. On a planet of finite resources, with the expectation of at least two billion more residents by 2050, this profligacy, Tristram Stuart argues in his book Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal, is obscene.Others have been making similar arguments for years, but reducing food waste has become a matter of international urgency. Some U.S. schools, where children dump up to 40 percent of their lunches into the trash, are setting up sharing tables, letting students serve themselves portions they know they’ll eat, allotting more time for lunch, and scheduling it after recess—all proven methods of boosting consumption. Countless businesses, such as grocery stores, restaurants, and cafeterias, have stepped forward to combat waste by quantifying how much edible food isn’t consumed, optimizing their purchasing, shrinking portion sizes, and beefing up efforts to move excess to charities. Stuart himself has made a specialty of investigating conditions farther up the supply chain, where supermarket standards and ordering practices lead to massive, but mostly hidden, dumps of edible food.Grade standards—industry driven and voluntary—were devised long ago to provide growers and buyers with a common language for evaluating produce and mediating disputes. They also can help reduce food waste. If growers can sort their asparagus or tangelos into established grades, they stand a better chance of finding markets for their “seconds.” Supermarkets have always been free to set their own standards, of course, but in recent years upscale grocers have started running their produce departments like beauty pageants, responding to customers, they say, who expect only platonically ideal produce: apples round and shiny, asparagus straight and tightly budded.“It’s all about quality and appearance,” says Rick Stein, vice president of fresh foods at the Food Marketing Institute. “And only the best appearance will capture share of the consumer’s wallet.” Some of the produce that doesn’t capture share will be donated to food banks or chopped up and used in a supermarket’s prepared meals or salad bar, but most of U.S. grocers’ excess food is neither donated nor recycled. Stuart applauds some U.S. and EU supermarkets’ recent campaigns to sell “ugly” produce at a discount, but he prefers a systemic fix. “It would be far better to simply relax the standards,” he says, surveying a sea of abandoned Peruvian citrus for which no secondary market—ugly or otherwise—exists.As the population grows and emerging economies develop a taste for meat and dairy products, which require huge inputs of grain and other resources for relatively little caloric gain, this toll will worsen. But converting more wildlands to farm fields may not be necessary, some experts say. If we slash waste, change our diet to eat less meat and dairy, divert fewer food crops to biofuels, and boost yields on underperforming acres, we may be able to feed more than nine billion people a healthy diet without trashing more rain forests, plowing up more prairies, or wiping out more wetlands.By the end of 2015 the UN and the U.S. had pledged to halve food waste by 2030. The exact mechanisms of this ambitious goal haven’t been spelled out. But already countries and companies are devising and adopting standardized metrics to quantify waste. If the target is met, enough food could be saved to feed at least one billion people.Excerpted from a March 2016 magazine article.",
"Tucked into a suburban Long Island neighborhood, a 12-acre plot may be growing the future.Under a blistering July sun, Zachary Lippman bends over a row of foot-high plum tomato plants to reveal budding yellow flowers that will each produce a tomato and ripen over the summer. Out here, on the grounds of a former dairy farm, it has all the appearance of age-old tradition.But inside a nearby lab, Lippman advanced the selective breeding process with a little nip and tuck of the plant’s own DNA, and now the “edited” plant is about to bear fruit in the field.“There’s a long way to go, but what we have able to do in the last four or five years is unbelievable,” says Lippman, a professor of genetics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. “It’s science fiction.”He created the plants using gene editing, a technology—based on a natural process—that allows researchers to cut out certain bits of DNA in order to control traits. The cell’s genetic structure then repairs itself automatically, minus the targeted gene. His tomatoes are now programmed to produce double the number of branches and, as a result, twice the tomatoes.In medicine, gene editing could potentially cure inherited diseases, such as some forms of heart disease and cancer and a rare disorder that causes vision loss. In agriculture, the technique can create plants that not only produce higher yields, like Lippman’s tomatoes, but also ones that are more nutritious and more impervious to drought and pests, traits that may help crops endure more extreme weather patterns predicted in the coming years.Today hundreds of research and development labs are at work testing the potential of Crispr—the technique’s acronym—to solve a range of food-related concerns for both consumers and growers: reduced-gluten wheat that could be tolerated by those with sensitivities, a mushroom that doesn’t brown when bruised or cut, soybeans lower in unhealthy fats, and even protecting the global chocolate supply—candymaker Mars is behind an effort to bolster cacao’s ability to fight off a virus that’s devastating the crop in West Africa.The first of these new gene-edited crops—canola—went on the market this year, with more coming in 2019. U.S. federal regulators say that because these plants do not contain foreign DNA—that is, DNA from viruses or bacteria, both used to create the first genetically-modified organisms, or GMOs—they don’t need the strict regulation and years of testing required for GMOs. On July 25, however, the European Union’s high court ruled for regulating gene-edited plants the same as GMOs.Agricultural scientists have been improving plants through biotechnology for 25 years by transferring genes from one plant (or bacteria) species into another. These GMOs have allowed farmers to spray more herbicides without damaging their crops, or to create disease-resistant papayas in Hawaii, for example.Even though science has not shown any human health effects of eating GMOs, they have been the target of consumer boycotts and tough government regulations throughout Europe and some U.S. states, spurred by distrust of the big corporations that create GMOs and the ramifications of mixing genes from two species.But newer gene-editing tools such as Crispr (and there are others) achieve the same effects without transferring new genes from one organism to another. Gene editing is also simpler, cheaper, and faster than creating GMOs.Because gene editing is relatively easy for those with proper training and basic lab facilities and not tightly controlled by a few companies, some experts say that it might allow developing nations to grow drought-free corn or nutrient-fortified vegetables without buying expensive seeds from large multinational firms. It’s also faster than growers methodically crossing generations of plant species to eventually get the desired trait—Crispr shaves years from that process.“This is about finding more efficient ways to improve crop productivity,” says Lippman, 45, who has been at the forefront of gene-editing research for the past decade.For generations, commercial tomato breeders preferred fewer rather than too many branches, because the plant would fall under the weight of fruit or be unable to convert those extra flowers into fruits, compromising yields. “We had to find the sweet spot,” he says.After years of studying different genes, researchers were able to fine-tune branching by lowering the activity of certain genes, as well as making tomatoes easier to pick by ensuring that the green cap stays attached to the plant rather than the fruit.“We are still working with everything that nature has provided. With traditional breeding, whatever traits nature has kicked out of the DNA, that’s the hand you have been played,” Lippman says. “With gene editing, now you are playing poker with aces up your sleeve.”Still, not everyone is convinced that gene editing is an improvement over traditional breeding methods. Gene editing makes permanent changes in a plant’s genome that are passed on through seeds. Others say Crispr practitioners benefit from biotechnology regulations that haven’t kept pace with developments.“This is the new kind of genetic engineering, whether you call it transgenic [GMO] or not,” says Jaydee Hanson, an analyst at the Center for Food Safety, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. “It should be adequately regulated. We’re not saying it should be stopped—we should know what has been done.”Yet proposed federal labeling rules exclude foods that use Crispr and other gene-editing techniques from those requirements since the mutations haven’t introduced bits of the so-called foreign DNA.Experts in the field suggest that the ultimate success of gene editing will not be decided by scientists, entrepreneurs, or activists, but by shoppers and farmers.One researcher says he could produce a tastier tomato through gene editing by increasing flavor-enhancing lycopene, but he’s holding back.“I don’t want to be the first, but I’d like to be the second,” says Harry Klee of the University of Florida. “It’s like speeding on the highway.”Klee has a good market for his seeds of traditionally cross-bred tomato varieties; he’s hesitant to introduce Crispr-edited ones because of the wild card of public reception.A few miles outside Clark, South Dakota, Jason McHenry and his father run a 1,500-acre farm, growing wheat, corn, soybeans, and livestock. About 20 years ago, the McHenrys planted genetically-modified corn and soybeans that resist pests like nematode worms and weeds, allowing them to use fewer chemicals.“It simplified life and helped us get ahead of the weeds,” says McHenry, 33, a third-generation farmer. It also saved the operation money and boosted production.At the same time, he realizes that some consumers avoid GMOs, including his two sisters, who are raising families in the area. Soybeans have also been under pressure because soybean-based cooking oil is high in the trans fats that raise cholesterol levels and can contribute to heart disease. The FDA required food companies to remove them completely by June 2018.But last year, at a meeting of South Dakota soybean producers, McHenry heard about a new kind of soybean plant that produces a healthier oil, high in oleic acid, found in olive oil and avocados.The plant was created using Talen, another form of gene editing developed at the University of Minnesota and licensed by start-up biotech firm Calyxt. The soybean had changes in two genes involved in fatty-acid synthesis; the resulting oil has no trans fats and is suitable for cooking, frying, and baking.McHenry and his father decided to plant 80 acres. “If we are going to make a healthier U.S., it has to start with us,” McHenry says. “My sisters lit up and said ‘this is what we need to do.’”McHenry is now on his second crop. Calyxt provides the seeds and then buys back the soybeans after harvest. The company crushes them to extract the oil, while leftover “mush” gets fed to cows and pigs.Market demand is also important to farmers like McHenry. “We started with one field and are just going to see how it works,” he says. “There’s no sense producing something if people don’t want it.”Calyxt CEO Federico Tripodi says commercial food companies are evaluating the oil for cooking and as an ingredient in baked goods, nut butters, and vegetarian meat replacements. He hopes to have a buyer soon.“In the U.S. there is widespread public distrust of GMOs,” Tripodi says. “In part this is due to a perception that these products are unnatural and developed for the benefit of large corporations, not consumers. At the same time, there are growing numbers of consumers with health-related fears, such as diabetes, obesity, and food allergies that directly impact their food choices.” In addition to its reduced-fat product, Calyxt is also developing a high-fiber, reduced-gluten wheat.Plant geneticists are also hoping to bring gene editing to farmers in the developing world who lack resources and high-tech tools.Samuel Acheampong grew up in a village outside Cape Coast, Ghana, where sweet potatoes are a staple. A graduate student at North Carolina State University, Acheampong is developing a bigger sweet potato using the Crispr technique.Inside his laboratory at the sprawling campus in Raleigh, North Carolina, Acheampong explained how he mapped the genome of the American-bred variety of sweet potato he’s using in order to identify the location of a set of genes, called CWII, that regulate the flow of sugar from photosynthesis in the leaves to the roots and tubers.By removing these inhibitors using Crispr, the plant can send more sugar to the roots. This extra sugar, he projects, will produce bigger sweet potatoes, his first goal.While the molecular scissor-like Crispr process is fairly straightforward, identifying and sequencing the genes and analyzing their function can take several years, Acheampong says.He’s started growing a few tiny sweet potato cells. The next step is performing the gene edit on the cells, turning the cells into plants, and then getting them big enough for the greenhouse and eventually field trials.Acheampong is spending the summer collecting DNA samples from Ghana’s 50 sweet potato varieties. Once back to the lab, he’ll sequence their genomes to locate the CWII gene. In future experiments, he’ll use Crispr to shore up the plant’s resistance to several destructive viruses in Africa, along with boosting beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is a precursor for Vitamin A, which is needed to maintain the body’s immune system, particularly in pregnant women, children, and those who are HIV-positive.“Vitamin A deficiency is a problem in Ghana. So you want to help to address this by improving the beta-carotene,” says Acheampong. “We can do this in two or three years. Whatever I learn here I’m taking back to Ghana.”Fed by researchers like Acheampong, gene-editing technology is spreading rapidly from the U.S. and Europe to the developing world. One way to measure the rise of Crispr and other forms of gene-editing is by scientific publication.From two dozen journal articles in all of 2008, Crispr-related scientific-paper submissions (for all applications, not just agri-food) now number 10 per day, and will shortly reach 10,000 total, according to Rodolphe Barrangou, a pioneer in the field and one of the discoverers of how bacteria use Crispr to fend off invading viruses. That finding led to applications in gene editing.“Crispr has been democratized,” says Barrangou, who is editor in chief of the newly-established Crispr Journal and also oversees a multidisciplinary Crispr lab at NC State. “With 100,000 labs and 10 people per lab, we now may have over a million geneticists working with this technology.”Barrangou started his career as a food scientist at DuPont. After he helped establish how Crispr works in nature in 2007, he used it to problem-solve in commercial yogurt and cheese starter cultures, where fermenting strains frequently get attacked by viruses. Today he and his lab are working to develop new probiotics that promote intestinal health.Barrangou is naturally bullish on Crispr and its potential to both cure disease and help feed the world. Finding new ways to boost food production is essential, especially as climate change makes weather, water, and soil conditions more unpredictable. He’s also realistic that there are still a few bottlenecks to overcome.“Academics are not going to feed the world,” says Barrangou in his campus office. “They are going to enable, with their scientific knowledge, people who can enable the world to feed itself. It’s the farmers who grow most of our foods, not the academics, and the farmers will get their seeds from seed companies.”Slowly but surely, seed companies are tapping Crispr gene-editing for commercial crops destined to be ingredients derived from corn, wheat, flax, and canola. The next step will be foods like strawberries or tomatoes that consumers can actually touch and taste.For Zachary Lippman, the ultimate consumer litmus test was inside his own home: His wife, Shira, has reservations about eating food produced through biotechnology.He’d scramble two tomatoes, one GMO and one non-GMO, behind his back and ask her to choose. Without knowing which was a GMO, she wouldn’t eat either one.But over time, Lippman and his wife—and their six children—have chewed over the work he does. He says these family discussions have led to a better understanding of why people may have a hard time accepting gene-edited foods but also their benefits.Now, when he plays the same guessing game using one of his gene-edited tomatoes, his wife has a different response.“She’ll eat a tomato,” he said. The kids? None of them actually like tomatoes.",
"Two days after being injected with a gene-editing enzyme, these developing human embryos were free of a disease-causing mutation.What if you could remove a potentially fatal gene mutation from your child’s DNA before the baby is even born? In an advance that's as likely to raise eyebrows as it is to save lives, scientists just took a big step toward making that possible.For the first time, researchers in the United States have used gene editing in human embryos. As they describe today in the journal Nature, the team used “genetic scissors” called CRISPR-Cas9 to target and remove a mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a common inherited heart disease, in 42 embryos.If CRISPR sounds familiar, there’s a reason: Ever since its introduction, it’s been at the center of a heated debate about the ethics of gene editing. (Read more about how the DNA revolution is changing us in National Geographic magazine.)Scientists who want to explore the technique hail it as a biomedical advance that could one day give people the option not to pass down heritable diseases. The tool could also reduce the number of embryos that are discarded during fertility treatments because of worrisome genetic mutations.But critics counter that it takes more than safety or even efficacy to make a procedure ethical.“The scientists are out of control,” says George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health, who thinks that scientists should not edit the genomes of human embryos for any reason. “They want to control nature, but they can't control themselves.”(Take our poll: Should gene editing be used on human embryos?)According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs in about one in 500 people. The condition causes the heart muscle to thicken and can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.It takes only one gene mutation to cause the condition, and you can get the disease even if only one of your parents has the mutated gene. If you inherit it, there’s a 50 percent chance you will pass it on to your children.For their work, Shoukhrat Mitalipov, principal investigator at the Oregon Health and Science University’s Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, and his colleagues targeted the genetic mutations that cause the majority of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases.First, they created 58 human embryos from the sperm of a male donor with the mutation and the egg of a female without the mutation. Then, they used CRISPR to cut the mutation out of the gene. The gene editing tool guides an enzyme called Cas-9 to a targeted position on DNA and snips the molecule at just the right spot. When things go right, the DNA repairs itself and the mutation disappears.The technique isn’t always successful. In previous studies, some CRISPR-edited embryos developed mosaicism, a condition in which some cells have the unwanted mutations and others don’t.So the team developed a new method: injecting sperm and CRISPR into the egg simultaneously instead of waiting until after fertilization to edit the genes. This time, they say, mosaicism did not occur.All in all, the team was able to repair the gene mutation in about 70 percent of the embryos, and the study showed no unwanted changes at other sites in the edited DNA.The team allowed the fertilized cells to develop into blastocysts—the stage at which embryos are usually implanted into the mother during fertility treatments. They showed normal development, the team reports. Then, the embryos were destroyed.The edited embryos were allowed to develop into blastocysts, seen here.“Of course further research and ethical discussions are necessary before proceeding to clinical trials,” study coauthor Paula Amato, adjunct associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at OHSU, said during a press briefing on August 1.Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine asked an international committee of scientists and ethicists to weigh in on the benefits and risks of genome editing in humans. (Find out why scientists think gene editing is both terrifying and terrific.)The panel recommended that in the case of the human germline—genes passed down from generation to generation—scientists refrain from editing genes for any purpose other than treating or preventing a disease or disability. The report also insisted on a more robust public debate before such experiments begin.In the United States, there’s currently a ban on using taxpayer funds for any research that destroys human embryos.In this case, the researchers forged ahead with their work and used institutional and private funds. If the team can’t move ahead as quickly as desired in the U.S., they’ll consider pursuing their research in other countries.While editing out genetic diseases may still seem far off, people should pay close attention to this kind of research, says Sakthivel Sadayappan, director of the heart branch of the University of Cincinnati’s Heart, Lung and Vascular Institute.“This is exciting,” says Sadayappan, who was not involved in the new CRISPR study. “This is the future.”The experiment’s small sample size certainly leaves something to be desired. But Sadayappan says it’s worth conducting and supporting the research. “Of course feasibility studies have issues,” he says. “But it’s the only way science can evolve.”For Sadayappan, who researches hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the stakes are high. Patients who have inherited the mutation from both parents, he says, “have no option other than this technology if they want to have offspring.”It’s already possible to screen for genetic defects within embryos during in vitro fertilization using a process called preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The team thinks their CRISPR technique could eventually be applied to gene mutations associated with other diseases, like cystic fibrosis.In their paper, the team writes that their method may one day “rescue mutant embryos, increase the number of embryos available for transfer and ultimately improve pregnancy rates.”“That’s just absurd,” says Annas. “They admit right up front that if you want to avoid having a baby with [the mutation], you can just not implant the embryos that are affected.”Mitalipov disagrees: “Discarding half the embryos is morally wrong,” he tells National Geographic. “We need to be more proactive.”Either way, Annas says, it’s time to revisit the conversation about how to regulate CRISPR in the United States. “My guess is that the regulators will be horrified.”But for Mitalipov, the debate is a chance to inform the world about the technique’s potential. And for a scientist who has also cloned monkey embryos and even cloned human embryos to make stem cells, he knows plenty about how to ignite public debate.“We’ll push the boundaries,” he says.",
"Soybean plants stand in a flooded field near Wyanet, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 1, 2014. Increasingly unstable weather threatens crops in bread baskets like the U.S. Midwest, says a new report from the UN.The impacts of climate change on land are already severe and will substantially increase food prices, risking widespread food instability, says a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The Special Report on Climate Change and Land warned that a food crisis looms, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions, if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions go unchecked. Rising temperatures may also reduce the nutritional value of crops and will significantly reduce crop yields, the report said.Extreme weather events have already increased in size and intensity and are playing a role in food price spikes in recent years, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, Coordinating Lead Author of the IPCC Special Report and a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.Extensive spring flooding in the U.S. Midwest this year led to extremely late planting of corn and soy crops, reducing potential yields. Drought wilted rice fields in Thailand and Indonesia, and scorched sugar cane plantations and oilseed crops in India.Record-breaking heat waves in Europe this summer have affected many crops, including an expected 13 percent decline in French wine production.“The potential for failure of multiple bread basket regions is increasing,” says Rosenzweig in a press conference from Geneva.Bread basket regions are places that produce large quantities of grains like the U.S. High Plains, or that produce large volumes of rice, such as Southeast Asia.Crop yields and animal growth rates are already falling. Nutrition levels are also expected to decline with continued CO2 emissions, putting already poor countries at very severe risk of increased hunger and malnutrition, she said.The IPCC Special Report is the first-ever comprehensive look at the whole land-climate system. It involved 103 experts from 52 countries and weighs in at over 1300 pages. A 65-page “Summary for Policymakers” was released today. The summary was approved line-by-line by the world’s various governments at a special meeting this week in Geneva.“It’s an incredibly ambitious and wide-ranging report. It was difficult to get agreement on the summary,” says Jim Skea, co-chairman of an IPCC working group.The report calls for a transformation of food systems from industrial agriculture to sustainable land management, using practices found in organic and agroecological farming.“We have to protect the quality of the entire landscape where food is produced,” says Louis Verchot of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and a lead author of the special report.That means preventing further degradation of soils, water, insect life, or any element of the biosphere from farm field to consumers’ tables, Verchot said.Agriculture and global food systems need to be reformed because they are a big part of the climate problem, producing about one-third of total carbon emissions, said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University.However, they can be part of the solution. More efficient, sustainable forms of food production can reduce emissions, freeing up land that can be used to store carbon in soils and vegetation like trees, said Howden, a vice chairman of an IPCC working group.“Reductions in food loss and waste, currently estimated to be 25-30 percent of the global food produced, could have similar benefits,” he says in an email.Land is under tremendous development pressures. But carbon emissions can be reduced and ecosystems protected while increasing food production, said Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University and a lead author of the report.“We don’t need any new technologies, just making informed choices,” says McElwee in a press conference.Those include choosing to end deforestation in the tropics and protecting peatlands and coastal wetlands, along with cutting food waste and reducing meat consumption. It means choosing to scale up sustainable farming practices so that more food can be grown, while increasing organic carbon in soils, and helping small farmers improve their livelihoods, while enhancing biodiversity.“I don’t want to say these choices are a no-brainers but…,” she says.Protecting the world’s remaining forests as quickly as possible is a definite no-brainer, according to Charlotte Streck, head of climate think-tank Climate Focus. Streck says the sharp increases in meat consumption in China and Asia pose a threat to forests and the climate. Eating less meat is healthier, and since over 60 percent of agricultural land is used for meat production, cutting meat consumption would free up a lot of land for reforestation, she said.“The inherent value of forests is gigantic,” says Carlos Nobre, a senior scientist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.However, the current Brazilian government under Jair Bolsonaro sees no economic value in protecting forests. Deforestation in the Amazon has accelerated 40 percent in the last year, Nobre said in a press conference.“Few political leaders in the tropics see the value in protecting forests,” he says.Countries need to integrate the findings of the special report into their climate action plans and make them part of their increased national commitments to reduce emissions, said Stephan Singer, senior advisor at Climate Action Network International. Under the Paris Agreement, most countries are expected to increase their climate pledges next year.“These pledges should include no deforestation, legislated restoration of forests on degraded lands, support for sustainable agriculture and secure land rights for indigenous and local communities,” says Singer.Richer nations need cut their own carbon emissions to zero before 2050 and provide massive funding to developing countries to protect their forests.“Governments face hard choices now because they’ve been negligent for 30 years,” he said. “This is only way left to get to close to 1.5 C.”As part of the 2105 Paris Agreement every country in the world agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) to limit the damaging impacts of climate change.",
"Water pools in rain-soaked farm fields on May 29, 2019 near Gardner, Illinois. This year, corn planting is the most delayed it's been in recorded U.S. history.Seen from above, the Midwestern U.S. looks more like a marsh than the fertile fields that grow some of the nation’s most lucrative crops. That’s because this spring has been one of the rainiest on record for the region. As a result, many farmers have been forced to leave their fields empty.And though it’s difficult to link one single weather event to climate change, climate scientists say the devasting rains falling over the Midwest are exactly in line with what they’ve been predicting.“Overall, it’s climate change,” says Donald Wuebbles, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “We expect an increase in total precipitation in the Midwest, especially in winter and spring, with more coming as larger events.”Depending on the state, early June is the latest corn can be planted and mid-June is the latest soybeans can be planted. After that, temperatures climb too high and rain falls too little for the crop to be successful.The U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors crop progress during the planting season, and on May 28 they reported that only 58 percent of the corn that could be planted was in the ground. For soybeans, it was only 29 percent. That's a big deal for U.S. farmers who supply a quarter of the world's grains, a category that includes corn, wheat, and rice.Farmers took to Twitter to document the disastrous impacts of rain. Using the hashtag #noplant19, they showed flat plains full of water.“When you warm up the atmosphere, the atmosphere can hold more moisture,” says David Easterling, the chief of the scientific services devision at the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.He explains that much of the rain falling over midwestern states originated in the skies over the Gulf of Mexico, where waters have warmed. As that atmosphere above the gulf warms, it’s capable of holding more moisture, which it will ultimately dump somewhere. Last year, major flooding left behind by hurricanes was attributed to climate change-induced warming.In the most recently published National Climate Assessment, in 2018, for which Easterling served as the director for the technical support unit, researchers concluded that the U.S. would face more catastrophic flooding that would affect infrastructure and crops.“As you continue to warm the atmosphere, you can expect to see more of these extreme events in the future,” he says.Rain does more than just prevent crops from being put in the ground. Once planted, the roots can be damaged by too much moisture, making it difficult for the plant to continue growing. One recently published study found that extreme rainfall can be just as bad for crops as drought or intense heat.The economic impact facing farmers and consumers is uncertain, says Matthew Pots, an economist who studies corn, soybean, and wheat markets.“A lot will depend on the growing season,” he says. “This crop could go anywhere. It will be below trend line and will depend on summer weather. It's going to be pollinating at a hot time, which could stress the crop as well.”Corn used in cattle feed will likely be more expensive, he says, alluding that the poor harvest will trickle into other industries and drive up some prices in the grocery stores.As if this season's rain wasn't bad enough, farmers are also bearing the brunt of a trade war. In response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese imports last May, China has refused to buy U.S. crops like soy. Many farmers stock both corn and soybean seeds and turn to soy when they're unable to fully plant corn. Without China, the market for that soy has shrunk."We are living climate change right now," says Evan DeLucia, a plant biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He notes that geneticists can modify crops to withstand floods and drought, but creating a plant that can do both will be challenging.Pot says he hasn't yet seen climate change push farmers to change their practices, but “after a year like this, do more people buy in [to climate change]? That could be possible.”",
"On June 26, Parisians and tourists play in the Trocadero Fountain, across the Seine River from the Eiffel Tower, in an effort to cool off.Another deadly heat wave has Europe in its sweaty grip this week. Record temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) in parts of France, Germany, Poland and Spain, with hotter days to come. The same thing happened last year—record-breaking heat was responsible for 700 deaths in Sweden and more than 250 in Denmark, countries that have never needed air conditioning before this new era of climate-change-driven extreme events.Europe’s five hottest summers in the past 500 years have all occurred in the last 15 years, not including this summer. All have been deadly. The 2003 heat wave was the worst, having led to the deaths of over 70,000 people; in 2010, 56,000 died in Russia alone.These extreme heat events are all connected to a slower jet stream that locks weather systems into place, says Michael Mann of Penn State University. Mann co-authored a study last year that linked the slowdown in the jet stream—the band of high-altitude winds that sweep around the globe from west to east—to last summer’s unprecedented droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and flooding events across the entire Northern Hemisphere. And it is likely behind India’s weak monsoon rains and the widespread flooding in the U.S. Midwest this year.“My colleagues at PIK (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research) have verified that this is what we’re seeing right now in Europe,” Mann said in an email.The loss of sea ice in the Arctic is amplifying warming in the northernmost regions of our planet, and that is disrupting the natural jet stream patterns, said Dim Coumou of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and PIK. Jet stream winds are driven by the temperature difference between the icy air of the Arctic and hot air from the tropics. A rapidly warming Arctic—this past winter it saw its lowest ever ice cover—reduces that temperature difference and slows the jet stream.Like a slow-moving river, a slower jet stream forms deep meanders, which can stall during the summer, sometimes for weeks. Weather patterns stall with them, whether they be heat waves or torrential rains.While temperatures in Europe are nowhere near as hot as India’s current month-long heat wave—temperatures on the Asian subcontinent have reached 123°F (51°C)—most Europeans, particularly in the north, are unused to anything over 85°F. Air-conditioning remains rare. It’s found in less than five percent of homes in France, for example, and less than two percent of German homes.The number of heat wave days in European cities are nearly double those of the surrounding suburban and rural landscape because of the urban heat island effect, said Jürgen Kropp of PIK. Concrete and asphalt absorb heat during the day and release it at night, keeping urban areas hotter. Without major cuts in carbon emissions, the number of heat wave days in cities will increased 10-fold by the end of this century, Kropp said. “Wednesday was the hottest day ever for June, here in Berlin.”There is a real debate about what to do about the increasing heat, he went on. Air-conditioning increases energy use, which will increase Germany’s carbon emissions, making climate change worse. The majority of Germans want more action on climate, Kropp said—but window AC units are in high demand right now.Europe has learned from the 2003 heat wav, which killed more than 70,000 across the continent, said Richard Keller, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of medical history. The death toll should be more limited this year, said Keller, the author of Fatal Isolation, a book on the Paris heat wave of 2003 that killed thousands. “France is much better prepared, emergency services are in place, and awareness of the dangers is much higher,” Keller said.Some schools in France are closed — hardly any have air-conditioning, Keller said. Cooling areas and temporary water fountains have been set up in busy city areas; parks and swimming pools are being kept open later. In Paris, older cars are banned from the city to counteract the fact a heat wave aggravates the city’s pollution.A reduction in pollution levels will be a silver lining for women’s World Cup soccer fans who will pack Paris’s Parc des Princes stadium Friday to watch the U.S. national team play host team France.“The heat won’t be a problem for the players,” Keller said. “They’re top-notch athletes who can cope. It’s the fans who are at risk of heat stroke.”",
"Flames engulf trees near Fort McMurray, Alberta, on May 6, 2016. That devastating wildfire is one of many recent events included in a new study about future disasters.Last summer’s unprecedented droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and flooding events in the northern hemisphere have been linked to atmospheric conditions resulting from a rapidly warming Arctic. With continued global warming the conditions that spawn such destructive and prolonged weather extremes will increase 50 percent on average and may increase as much as 300 percent, a new study in the journal Science Advances has revealed.The wildfires in California and the heat wave in Europe were the worst ever. The unprecedented wildfires in the Arctic and flooding in Japan are also all connected to a slower jet stream that locks weather systems into place, says climate scientist Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University, lead author of the study.It’s not just last summer. The 2011 Texas/Oklahoma droughts, the 2013 European floods, the 2015 California wildfires, and the 2016 Alberta wildfires have been linked to a hotter Arctic that’s disrupting the flow of the jet stream.“We’re seeing the impacts of climate change play out in realtime on our TV screens and in our news headlines,” Mann said.People walk on a catwalk in a flooded St. Mark's Square during a period of seasonal high water in Venice, Italy, on October 29, 2018.These events will be more frequent and more intense with continued burning of fossil fuels, he said. “Things could get a whole lot worse without immediate action to reduce carbon emissions.”This study comes out the same time as new research published in Nature that suggests the world's ocean has been soaking up more heat than previously thought in recent years. The implication is that this could mean the planet is headed for even more rapid warming in response to greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn could further impact weather.The high-altitude, west-to-east winds known as the jet stream are driven by the temperature difference between the icy air of the Arctic and hot air from the tropics. The Arctic is warming two to three times faster than anywhere else, which reduces the temperature difference and slows the jet stream. Like a slow-moving river, a slower jet stream also meanders and can stall during the summer, sometimes for weeks.The climate model projections about how often the jet stream will stall and lead to extreme events from now until 2100 range from a slight decrease to a 300 percent increase, said co-author Kai Kornhuber, a researcher at the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. There isn’t enough good long-term data—and the various climate models handle the complexities of future cloud cover and tiny particles called aerosols from air pollution differently—Kornhuber said in an interview.“However, a 50 percent increase is very likely and that’s likely conservative,” he said.Shutting down coal-fired power plants will minimize the odds of summers like 2018 in the future, the study also shows. Coal plants are a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) that traps the suns’ heat. They are also a significant source of air pollution in the form of small particles or aerosols that reflect some of the suns’ heat, causing regional cooling.“A reduction of air pollution in the industrialized countries could actually restore some of the natural temperature difference between the mid-latitudes and the Arctic,” says co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research.And that would help to prevent the future increase in stalling of the jet stream and the related weather extremes. “If we want to limit the increase of dangerous weather extremes, phasing out coal fast seems like a pretty good idea,” Rahmstorf said in a press release.",
"Wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at shockingly fast speeds, consuming everything in their paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an hour, which converts to about a four-minute-mile pace, and can overtake the average human in minutes.In 2020, the wildfire season in the United States—which lasts from June through September—promises to be particularly devastating. This summer is expected to be the hottest on record, with drought conditions predicted in California through September. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has derailed mitigation efforts—such as homeowner assistance programs and controlled burns—due to concerns over social distancing and respiratory dangers. By the end of June, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection had responded to nearly double the number of fires than it had in the entire 2019 season.Destruction caused by wildfires in the United States has significantly increased in the last two decades. An average of 72,400 wildfires cleared an average of 7 million acres of U.S. land each year since 2000, double the number of acres scorched by wildfires in the 1990s. In 2015, the largest wildfire season recorded in U.S. history burned more than 10 million acres of land.Because much of the U.S. is expected to get hotter and drier with climate change, wildfire risk is generally expected to rise. At the same time, as the population in the United States rises and people increasingly move into rural and wilderness areas, more homes and other structures are likely to be placed in harm’s way. That’s why it’s critical to understand how wildfires get started, how to stop them, and what to do when they occur.Though they are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as natural disasters, only 10 to 15 percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The other 85 to 90 percent result from human causes, including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson.Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry weather and droughts. In these conditions, normally green vegetation can convert into bone-dry, flammable fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly; and warm temperatures encourage combustion. With these ingredients, the only thing missing is a spark—in the form of lightning, arson, a downed power line, or a burning campfire or cigarette—to wreak havoc.Firefighters battle the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California, on November 12, 2018. That blaze burned nearly 97,000 acres in Southern California, killing three people and damaging an estimated $6 billion in property.Natural or man-made, three conditions must be present for a wildfire to burn: fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. Firefighters call these three elements the fire triangle.Fuel is any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, even homes. The greater an area's fuel load, the more intense the fire is likely to be. The most wildfire-prone state is California, which lost 259,148 acres of land to 8,194 wildfires in 2019.Air supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn. California wildfires are often made worse by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds, which can carry a spark for miles.Heat sources help spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite. Lightning, burning campfires or cigarettes, and even the sun can all provide sufficient heat to spark a wildfire.Violent infernos are most common in the western states, where heat, drought, and frequent thunderstorms create ripe conditions. Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and California experience some of the worst conflagrations. Wildfires also occur around the world and in most of the 50 states.Firefighters battle blazes by depriving them of one or more of the fire triangle fundamentals. One traditional method is to douse existing fires with water and spray fire retardants. Firefighters also sometimes work in teams, often called hotshots, to clear vegetation from the land around a fire to contain and eventually starve it of fuel. The resulting tracts of land are called firebreaks.Firefighters may also employ controlled burning, creating backfires, to stop a wildfire. This method involves fighting fire with fire. These prescribed—and controlled—fires remove undergrowth, brush, and litter from a forest, depriving an otherwise raging wildfire of fuel.Although they can be dangerous to humans, naturally occurring wildfires play an integral role in nature. By burning dead or decaying matter, they can return otherwise trapped nutrients to the soil. They also act as a disinfectant, removing disease-ridden plants and harmful insects from an ecosystem.High winds and hot temperatures fanned a 1996 wildfire in the foothills around Boise, Idaho, into an inferno that burned for seven days. When it was finally extinguished, the outbreak—dubbed the Eighth Street Fire—had scorched some 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) and stripped bare two of the region's major watersheds.Wildfires thin forest canopies and undergrowth, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and a new generation of seedlings to grow. In fact, some species of trees, like sequoias, rely on fire for their seeds to even open.Wildfires devastate anything in their path. In 2018, the most destructive California wildfire of all time caused 85 deaths and was the world’s costliest single natural disaster that year with losses exceeding $16 billion. While they are difficult to stop, there are many steps people can take before, during, and after wildfires to limit their damage.",
"In early June, a firefighter lights a backfire to stop the Quail Fire from spreading near Winters, California. Backfiring is a "fight fire with fire" strategy emergency responders use to stop a large fire from reaching more fuel and growing.In 2019 the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection—known simply as Cal Fire—responded to over 1,500 fires. In 2020, they’ve already seen more than 2,700.“Right now, whatever amount of moisture is left in the vegetation is drying out rapidly,” says Cal Fire Battalion Chief Amy Head. “Those fuel moisture levels are already low for June, so if we don’t have some sort of summer heavy rain … it will be a big problem.”And with resignation she acknowledges that heavy rain “probably won’t happen.”NOAA's Climate Prediction Center forecasts drought conditions for California through at least September, and the National Interagency Fire Center predicts this year’s fire season, lasting from June through September, will see an above average number of fires in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest. This summer is also promising to be the hottest on record, and a large wildfire in Arizona has already scorched nearly 200,000 acres. Firefighters and emergency responders are now bracing for this danger amid concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic could drain their workforce and present an additional health risk to first responders and evacuees.“None of us have had to do this before,” says Head. “None of us have had to deal with a major pandemic during wildfire season.”Even before wildfire season began, efforts to mitigate it had already been derailed. In April, citing concerns about social distancing and the respiratory danger of wildfire smoke, the U.S. Forest Service suspended a wildfire prevention method called controlled burns in several states. California, which had set aside billions to prepare for wildfires, had many projects put on hold after COVID-19’s economic fallout forced the state to make significant budget cuts.In Missoula County, Montana, a program run through the Montana Conservation Corps to make homes more fire resistant was paused this year.“When you’re looking at preventing wildland-urban disasters, doing the work around their home is arguably the most important thing to do when you’re talking about preventing disaster,” says Max Rebholz, the wildfire preparation coordinator for Missoula County.Rebholz points to the places where suburbs butt up against forests, and it’s often where homes are most at risk of catching fire. Typically, fire officials and volunteers help homeowners address risks like flammable roofs and yards with dry brush. This year some of that was done remotely, with video calls between homeowners and fire experts, but Rebholz says, “you can’t replace that in-person assessment.”(Read more about what happens when natural disaster strikes during a pandemic.)This spring, several wildland fire training academies cancelled or postponed courses, and some opted to train firefighters via Zoom.“There’s a number of questions we don’t have a good answer to,” says Jim Whittington, an independent consultant in wildland fire response. “How well are we going to be able to tap into the national resource ordering system and get people from all over the country? Is travel going to be limited? If they’re coming from a [COVID-19] hot spot, will that be a factor?”Those fighting the most remote wildfires are the forest service’s Hotshot crews. Stanton Florea, a fire communications specialist at the service, says the crews, typically cordoned into groups of 20, are observing CDC guidelines, maintaining distance from other crews and wearing masks when they occasionally enter public spaces.The CDC has even issued guidelines specific to wildfire fighters, though many echo recommendations made to the general public.The worst wildfires, however, necessitate thousands of firefighters to be stationed at a base camp. This year, Head says those camps will be more spread out and have additional sleeping trailers and hand-washing stations. In previous years, firefighters would gather for communal meals at large tables, and a 7:00 a.m. briefing, but to reduce crowding, Cal Fire plans to disseminate information and meals in shifts.In Arizona, where several large wildfires have already broken out, crews are already observing new social distancing rules.Paul Lemmon, an engine captain assigned to Arizona’s Mangum Fire, says what would normally be a consolidated large base camp has been broken into smaller “spike camps.” Meals are packaged and delivered to each camp, and updates are given remotely.“With COVID-19, everything is being briefed over radio. We don’t get that [in-person] connectivity. Everything is more virtual,” says Lemmon. Wellness checks, he says, are administered daily.One of the biggest challenges, notes Lemmon, is remaining distant from other crews that might normally be greeted with a handshake or hug: “We’re a tight-knit community; it’s hard not to say hi.”“We’re making sure our members are taking precautions, social distancing when possible,” says Ken Overton, public information officer at the Phoenix Fire Department. Despite Arizona’s growing number of COVID-19 infections, Overton says crews have remained largely healthy and firefighting tactics have not changed.Since COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that easily spreads from breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing, it makes sheltering evacuees from wildfires a logistical challenge.FEMA has issued updated guidelines to mitigate that spread. At disaster response centers, temperature checks, increased cleaning schedules, and wearing personal protective equipment are all recommended.The Red Cross, which provides disaster relief to those impacted by wildfires, has also revamped its strategy for providing emergency care. Mental health counseling and financial assistance will be provided remotely for the first time. Hotels used as shelters will keep evacuees physically distant, and when those aren’t available, cots in shared spaces can be spread farther apart, and evacuees’ health will be regularly monitored.An emailed statement to National Geographic included: “The Red Cross had a limited supply of varying types of PPE when the pandemic began, but we have since procured additional supplies including face coverings, disinfectant, thermometers, and other critical supplies to keep our workforce and the people we serve safe.”Ensuring victims have access to enough healthcare supplies can be challenging during natural disasters.“It very much complicates things, and there are a lot of teams right now at state and city levels working to figure out how they’re going to adjust,” says Nicolette Louissant, the executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit that specializes in helping people access health care after natural disasters.She encourages those who live in a region prone to wildfires to pack a “go bag” with supplies and clothes in case of an evacuation.It’s unclear to what extent wildfire smoke could make someone more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 or experiencing its worst respiratory impacts, though it’s a concern Whittington says many first responders have, since the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often targets the lungs.A study published earlier this month in the journal Environment International suggested an especially active wildfire season in the summer was associated with more cases of influenza the subsequent winter. Wildfire smoke carries dangerous particles called particulate matter 2.5, or PM 2.5, which can harm a person’s lungs and immune system.Erin Landguth, one of the study’s authors and an air pollution researcher at the University of Montana, cautions that more work needs to be done to establish a clear link between inhaling wildfire smoke and a greater vulnerability to influenza and coronaviruses.What is clear, she says, is that PM 2.5 “wreaks havoc on our lungs.”“We have evidence that it suppresses immune response, and it causes inflammation in the cells of our lungs,” Landguth says.Many states are already fighting an active fire season, but in September and October, Northern California, Oregon, and Washington could experience the worst. In Southern California, autumn will bring the hot, dry Santa Ana winds that make small fires more likely to grow disastrous.In past years, the U.S. has received firefighting assistance from international firefighting crews and volunteers. This year, it’s unclear whether they will be able to come to the rescue.Florea says the federal forest service has fully staffed its crews, and Head says Cal Fire has done the same.“It’s still early in the season. As the season progresses, we may see some suppression decisions made by lack of resources,” says Whittington, meaning that the aircraft, fire engines, and boots on the ground will be directed to the most dire fires.In Arizona, Lemmon says firefighters are adjusting, just like they always have when presented with a new challenge. “This is just another situation where we have to adapt and overcome. We’re still going to fight fire the same way—we’re just going to fight it from six feet apart.”Maya Wei-Haas contributed to this article.Reporting for this story was made possible in part by a workshop hosted by the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources.",
"Randy Shoemaker embraces his son Conner after the family survived a deadly tornado in Chatsworth, Georgia on Monday, April 13, 2020. As the roof was lifted off their mobile home, Shoemaker and his family covered themselves with mattresses for protection.Early in the morning of March 22, Ranko Glumac jolted from bed as the world around him shook. The room filled with the mechanical roar of a fallen hair drier. As Glumac lurched to the appliance to quiet the noise, he spotted a dark crack slicing through his bedroom wall, and he realized his home city of Zagreb, Croatia, had just been hit by an earthquake.He and his family rushed outside into the frosty spring air, and across the city others did the same. But another risk lurked in the throng of people: the novel coronavirus, which had already started ramping up in the region.A 5.3-magnitude earthquake shook the Croatian capital of Zagreb on March 22, 2020, damaging buildings and cutting electricity in a number of neighborhoods.The quake in Croatia was one of the earliest wake-up calls for people around the world that natural hazards still loom large during the COVID-19 pandemic, including floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and even volcanic eruptions.The risk is particularly acute in the United States, which now leads the global case count with roughly 640,000 confirmed ill. Models suggest that the country’s outbreak may soon be nearing its peak, overburdening health care systems, budgets, and supply chains. Already this week, tornadoes tore through the southeastern United States, killing at least 34 people and leaving more than half a million without electricity.“Disasters don’t stop for a virus,” says Craig Fugate, former administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).Still, experts stress that people living in disaster-prone regions are not helpless. Personal preparation is more important than ever—from fine-tuning disaster kits to cleaning out gutters and yards of anything that might act as tinder.“We can always shape a better future,” says disaster researcher Mika McKinnon.As spring sets in, many parts of the country face possible natural hazards. A recent NOAA forecast warns that 1.2 million people throughout the Midwest face risks of major flooding this spring. An early analysis from Colorado State University also suggests that Atlantic hurricanes, which generally form between June 1 and November 30, are more likely than average to make landfall this year.Devastation from extreme weather events has spiked sharply in recent years as climate change drives growth in the intensity and frequency of storms. Greenhouse gas emissions also contribute to extended droughts and more frequent and erratic wildfires along much of the U.S. West Coast.“We’ve had basically no snowpack down in the low country here in our area, so we know we’re going to have a bad fire season,” says Carlene Anders, mayor of Pateros, Washington, and executive director of the Disaster Leadership Team.In the United States, the response to disasters is a local endeavor at its core. Volunteers, first responders, and small nonprofits form the vanguard in any calamity. Next are regional and state response teams. The federal government only steps in if the catastrophe crosses borders or overloads local capacity to respond. But people at every level of the response system are facing fallout from the pandemic.“There’s really nothing about how we respond to a disaster that is not in some way impacted by COVID-19,” says Samantha Montano, an assistant professor in the University of Nebraska Omaha’s emergency management and disaster science program.The state of Tennessee serves as a potent example of the steep challenges communities face. The night of March 2, before the virus became widespread in the state, a series of twisters killed at least 25 people and injured hundreds more. The next morning, the community response was swift and sweeping.“We had literally a mile of cars that were either people coming to volunteer or people coming to drop stuff off,” says Tina Doniger, the executive director for the Community Resource Center (CRC) of Tennessee, a Nashville-based nonprofit that collects and distributes goods during emergencies. Other volunteers fanned out to clean up debris and cut up fallen trees.But the situation would soon change. On March 23, as the COVID-19 case count climbed, Nashville’s Metro Public Health Department directed residents to stay home unless engaged in essential activities, and efforts to rebuild ground to a halt.At the CRC, volunteer crews, which usually number in the hundreds, dwindled to 10, per official recommendations. Businesses shut their doors, many fundraising events were cancelled, and financial donations for emergency response slowed or were put on hold, says Amy Fair, vice president of donor services for the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee.Rescue teams search for missing people the day after a series of tornadoes cut through the Tennessee, toppling buildings and knocking out power lines. All that’s left standing of this building in the Buena Vista neighborhood is a lone door.In some ways, Nashville is uniquely prepared. Crews started storing supplies before COVID-19 descended on their region and shoppers drained stores of necessities like toilet paper, gloves, and cleaning products. “We’re going to be the only ones ready if a storm were to hit,” Doniger said last Thursday.Three days later, tornadoes struck the neighboring city of Chattanooga, and CRC was ready to help with emergency supplies. “Our volunteers are packing boxes as we write this message,” the organization posted to Facebook on Monday.As the situation in Tennessee shows, one of the fundamental challenges is that effective disaster response requires close contact—the opposite of social distancing.“Everybody physically comes together, physically converges on a community,” Montano says. Teams search for victims in the wreckage of buildings, distribution centers organize lines of volunteers, and survivors gather in tightly packed shelters. But the novel coronavirus adds extra risk to these life-saving activities.Under normal circumstances, more than half of the nation’s hospital beds are already filled. But feverish and coughing patients are now pouring in, even as doctors and nurses increasingly fall ill with COVID-19 themselves. First responders are also enduring illness among their ranks. As of this writing, nearly 10,600 firefighters and emergency medical service responders have reported exposure to COVID-19 in the United States alone—almost 5,000 of whom are in quarantine.Meanwhile, response groups are struggling to train the latest batches of emergency volunteers.Trained volunteers make up 70 percent of the U.S. firefighting force, and learning the ropes often requires in-person physical repetition. Yet training sessions for volunteer firefighters in Patreos, Washington, have shifted online, which limits the precinct’s ability to prepare novices to battle blazes, Anders says.Agencies are also struggling with dwindling funds under COVID-19, as emergency management is frequently understaffed and underfunded even without a pandemic. Erica Arteseros, captain in the San Francisco fire department, says she’s working to shift her volunteer training program for emergency response online, but she lacks the resources to address the issue. “I’m a staff of one and our budget is not growing,” she says.These challenges will only amplify as the scale of the potential disaster increases. Major catastrophes usually draw in teams and supplies from afar to augment local response. But the pandemic has been consuming resources, and travel restrictions hamstring movement. “That means when your local capacity is overwhelmed, you can’t reach out for more help,” McKinnon says.The most effective way to reduce risk is for individuals to take on a greater role, McKinnon says. Reporting potential dangers, such as overflowing riverbanks or tendrils of smoke in the distance, can buy crucial minutes for evacuation and response teams. Emergency kits are also vital for anyone living in disaster-prone regions, and they contain many of the same supplies that people bought to hunker down during the pandemic.At the same time, emergency response groups are coming up with creative ways to mitigate disaster.Some agencies are staying nimble to fill in potential gaps in disaster response. Evacuteer, a program dedicated to helping New Orleans residents evacuate during a hurricane, has shifted operations to raise money for shelf-stable food and supplies, since most agencies responsible for this facet of hurricane response are working to feed people who lost jobs due to the virus.Groups are also working to build community bonds, a major part of local resilience. San Francisco fire captain Arteseros and her team are encouraging community members to stay connected through the social media hub Nextdoor, particularly with at-risk individuals. “Having a neighbor that will check in on someone that is elderly when official channels are overwhelmed is priceless,” she says.The Red Cross is redesigning shelters to prevent the spread of disease, says Trevor Riggen, senior vice president of disaster cycle services.Shelters are often a collection of cots in an open space, like a gymnasium or community center—a setup where viruses can easily spread. So, the Red Cross is implementing new strategies, such as placing beds farther apart and checking people for symptoms before they enter and throughout their stay. Wherever possible, hotels will be used to keep people separated. Yet shelters still face challenges as health care workers are concerned about asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19.“That’s one thing we know we have to get right,” Riggen says. “The last thing we want to have happen is have someone not evacuate because they’re questioning where to go and whether shelters would be safe.”",
"Soldiers staff a nursing station in the intensive care section of a military field hospital at the CenturyLink Field Event Center in Seattle. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said on Wednesday that the field hospital will be returned to the government so it can be deployed to another state facing more of a crisis from the outbreak of the coronavirus.Earlier this week, soldiers from the 627th Army Hospital in Fort Carson, Colorado, were setting up folding panels to create cubicles for a new 250-bed field hospital in a major Seattle, Washington, sports stadium. By Wednesday afternoon, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee had announced that the hospital would be dismantled, and the life-saving health-care resources would be sent to other states that need them more.In the battle against the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that was the second time in just a few days that Washington’s governor said he had more help than required. On Sunday he announced he’d also be returning more than 400 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile so they could be sent elsewhere.As the rest of the nation grapples with a rising death toll and the surging spread of coronavirus, early actions appear to be working in the state where the virus first surfaced in the United States.Both of Inslee’s decisions come on the heels of a projection by modelers at the University of Washington that the state may well have hit peak demand for hospital resources, such as intensive care unit beds, on April 2. That was two weeks after the state shut down public schools and restaurants, and 10 days after the governor ordered residents to stay at home.“Thanks to the mitigation efforts the governor has put in place and the cooperation of Washingtonians, we have seen fewer infections in our communities than anticipated,” retired Admiral Raquel Bono, who is advising the governor on his response to the coronavirus pandemic, said in a statement. “Our current status allows us to help others who have a more immediate need.”It’s encouraging news, says Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer for population health at UW’s modeling group, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). “It’s telling us that this pandemic can come down faster than we expected, and we can control it by staying home,” he says.But this week’s actions raise a question: Does the region where coronavirus first took root in the United States already have its scariest days behind it? That will depend on how Washington residents respond. (Get the latest facts and figures about the coronavirus.)“We do not believe Washington State has turned a corner—we’re really emphatic on that point,” says Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk.The state is nowhere close to loosening stay-at-home restrictions put in place on March 23. Schools have been canceled for the rest of the academic year. The number of cases in the state continues to grow, topping 9,000 this week. The governor was able to break down the hospital and send back ventilators in part because the state was already prepared for surging demand. It purchased an extra 900 ventilators and 1,000 hospital beds for increased hospitalizations.But it does appear that the rate of increase in cases is finally slowing. And current estimates suggest the state eventually could see fewer fatalities than first thought.That puts state leaders in a tough spot. They want to buoy people who have been trapped inside for weeks with news that their sacrifices are paying off. But they also need to make clear that residents cannot yet change their behavior. During a press conference Thursday, Inslee himself made clear that as sunshine finally arrives in a state known for rain and clouds, acting as if things are better quite literally could get people killed.“The sun is out, the daffodils are beautiful, it’s warming up,” Inslee said. “But I just wanted people to fundamentally understand that this virus is just as deadly and dangerous to the wellbeing of Washingtonians as it was on March 23.”“Here’s the deal,” Inslee added. “Any backsliding that we experience, any reduction in commitment to this social distancing—any refusal to respect this stay-home, stay-healthy initiative—means more people are going to lose their lives in the state of Washington. That’s important to say because given some of our early success, given the fact that sun is out, it would be really human for us to take our foot off the pedal here. But that is just too dangerous.”The concern, of course, is that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is so contagious that a small increase in human interaction could lead to a resurgence in cases.“The message that Washington’s demand for resources is going to start leveling and declining is well supported by surveillance,” says Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard University’s School of Public Health. “But it’s natural that as the narrative starts coming out that we’re gaining control of this thing, people may be less strict in their own social-distancing practices.”In fact, the mayor of Seattle is so worried about it that she announced an emergency closure of the city’s 15 biggest parks between Friday night and Monday morning. “Seattle’s frontline medical workers, vulnerable residents, and displaced workers need you to stay home,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said.Hilary Godwin, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Washington, says the governor’s decisions this week do suggest a level of confidence that things may continue to improve.But experts stress that just because the state has reached a milestone, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t still a long road ahead.“The way I describe it to people is ‘hitting the peak’ means that we’re about halfway through the first phase,” Godwin said. “It’s not like we climbed a mountain and we just have to tumble down and it’s all going to be fine. The second half is going to be just as hard as the first half.”The experts point out that most of the modeling, both at UW and at other institutions, is premised on social distancing continuing for quite some time.“If we just waited until May and then let kids go back to school and all of the restaurants reopen, what you see from these studies is a predicted resurgence of cases,” Godwin says. “My sense is that the governor is being very responsible in his messaging to people—that they’ve done an amazing job following the guidance, but there’s still a long haul ahead of us.”In addition, models themselves are imperfect. They don’t always perfectly capture subtle nuances that could lead to complications later. And the University of Washington’s version is only one of many.“[The] IHME modeling is great but you have to take it with a grain of salt—it’s not a crystal ball,” says Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University. “Really what I think we’re seeing is a scaling down in terms of using intensive federal resources, which is good news because it means we’re not at the dire position we were earlier. It’s a good sign—but we still have much to do.”",
"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season has been extremely active, and deadly. Between Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, plus Jose, thousands of structures have been destroyed and many people have been killed, injured, or displaced. Hurricane Harvey's deadly cocktail of wind and moisture hit America's fourth-largest city with a ferocity that Texas has never seen.And while scientists maintain that no single weather event can be attributed to climate change, two centuries of human fossil-fuel burning has altered temperatures just enough to almost certainly make this particular storm worse."In general, the way to think about it is: climate change has changed the environment that everything is happening in," says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. "When you add in the climate's natural variability and then the right conditions come along, you can get a storm which is stronger than you might otherwise have expected."In the case of Harvey, which dumped rivers of rain in and around Houston and threatened millions of people with catastrophic flooding (see photos), at least three troubling factors converged. The storm intensified rapidly, it stalled out over one area, and it is dumped record rains for days and days.Here's how scientists explained what brought those ingredients together.Hurricanes tend to weaken as they approach land because they are losing access to the hot, wet ocean air that gives the storms their energy. Harvey's wind speeds, on the other hand, intensified by about 45 miles per hour in the last 24 hours before landfall, according to National Hurricane Center data.While that's not unheard of, the potential for wind speeds to rise rapidly increases under warmer conditions, says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric sciences professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who published groundbreaking research earlier this year on the potential for changes in hurricane wind speeds."Hurricanes are powered by the evaporation of sea water," Emanuel says. "Water evaporates faster from a hot surface than a cold surface."Emanuel analyzed the evolution of 6,000 simulated storms, comparing how they evolved under historical conditions of the 20th century, with how they could evolve at the end of the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising. The result: A storm that increases its intensity by 60 knots in the 24 hours before landfall may have been likely to occur once a century in the 1900s. By late in this century, they could come every five to 10 years.Scientists have known for decades that the peak intensity of severe storms will likely increase as temperatures rise. But it also is shortening the time it takes to reach those speeds. And late summer temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico now average more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they did 30 years ago, says Andreas Prein, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research."If you want your car to accelerate fast, you put your pedal to the metal," Emanuel says. "If you keep it there, it will go up to the top speed it can go. If you switch from a Volkswagen to a Ferrari, you'll have much faster acceleration and a higher top speed."Other researchers, such as Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, agrees. While he points out that many Category 4 and 5 storms experience a late surge of windspeed before landfall, he said he considered it "more likely than not" that climate change contributed to Harvey's last-minute intensification, and "I consider this a conservative attribution statement."The most damaging aspect of Harvey was the incredible amounts of rain it dropped. Some regions saw 40 inches or more of rain in less than a week, making it a potential record for the country. That wetness came from the sea surface and the atmosphere."Think about an ocean as an infinite supply of moisture," Prein says. "Harvey is sucking it toward land and dumping it on Texas."As the globe warms, rainfall is increasing all across mid-latitude regions. Just as with a hurricane's intensity, the heat built up in the sea surface from climate change allows the storm to take up more water vapor. And since the atmosphere, too, is warmer, its capacity to hold more moisture also increases.Every scientist contacted by National Geographic was in agreement that the volume of rain from Harvey was almost certainly driven up by temperature increases from human carbon-dioxide emissions.Wehner says the "lower bound" of the increase in rain as a result of climate's impact on temperature is at least 10 to 15 percent."The big story is the precipitation—it's a no-brainer," he says. "Pretty much everything we've done so far has suggested that in this situation, precipitation will be increased. Lots of simulations are being done. In every single one of them, it rains more."Trenberth says that climate change alone can increase rainfall 5 to 10 percent. But if a storm comes at a time when the ocean is also experiencing unusual but natural high temperatures, that could double the increase in rainfall. In fact, it's possible that this combination of climate change and natural variability may drive precipitation up far more than that."Some experiments suggest that these things can feed back on themselves and increase rainfall even more," he says.In fact, the dry air over land normally helps kill these storms. Harvey, on the other hand, actually pulled in moisture that it dumped on land that was once again evaporating into the atmosphere. The storm was, in a sense, helping feed itself.Of course, the volume of rain wouldn't matter quite so much if the storm just continued moving. But in the case of Harvey, Texans aren't so lucky. The storm pulled to a stop and parked itself over that region."The critical thing with Harvey is that it's stationary—it's not moving a lot," Prein says. "It's just dumping all this moisture over the same spot."So far, climate scientists say, it doesn't appear that climate change was a significant factor in that stall. It was just bad luck.The winds pushing Harvey around were weak. In addition, two high-pressure systems sitting over the Southwest and North were trying to drive Harvey in opposite directions, essentially keeping the storm from moving northward.Stalled weather systems are often associated with extreme events, Prein says, which can lead to human disasters. It was a factor in the deadly Chicago heat wave in 1995, in which a high-pressure system sat in the same location for days. And it played a role in the Colorado Front Range floods of 2013 and California’s recent drought.It's possible, and even expected by some scientists, that climate change ultimately could drive steering currents to be even weaker. That could potentially compound the effect, allowing storms to stick around even longer. But so far there just isn't any evidence of that.Put another way, Wehner says, "if there is a climate signal, it's one that's so weak we haven't been able to detect it." What he meant was: The circulation patterns that steer storms like Harvey have been weak in recent years, but that change has come on very quickly. That leads scientists to doubt it is connected to climate change.In a Facebook post, climate scientist Michael Mann of Penn State University expanded on that possibility. He agreed that the weak prevailing winds that failed to steer the storm back out to sea allowed it to "spin around and wobble back and forth like a top with no direction." He said that currently a climate connection would be "tenuous," but models predict similar behavior with climate change.To support victims of Harvey, consider giving to United Way of Greater Houston.This story was first published on August 28 and was updated on September 20.",
"The 19 firefighters who lost their lives battling a raging wildfire in central Arizona on Sunday were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, an elite crew of U.S. wildfire firefighters based in Prescott, Arizona.Hotshot crews—there are roughly 107 in the U.S.—consist of 20 firefighters who have been specifically trained to respond to fires in remote regions with little or no logistical support."In the world of wildland firefighting today, the hotshot crews are similar to the Special Forces in the military," said Dick Smith, a retired firefighter who spent 38 years fighting wildfires with the U.S. Forest Service. "They're highly trained and can meet the highest physical requirements."Candidates for the Granite Mountain Hotshots had to show that they could pass the arduous Pack Test and complete a series of physical activities, ranging from 40 sit-ups in 60 seconds to 7 pull-ups to a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) run in just under 11 minutes."We believe in rigorous physical and mental training, which allows us to perform at the optimum level in any location and under any circumstances," said the Hotshots' website."We are routinely exposed to extreme environmental conditions, long work hours, long travel hours and the most demanding of fire line tasks."Becoming a HotshotThe 2,000 or so firefighters who make up the nation's elite hotshot crews work in groups of 20, in crews scattered across the United States. During peak wildfire season, the crews are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (Related: Why is the West Ablaze?)"When the call comes, they don't know whether they're going to be at a fire 10 miles [16 kilometers] away or 500 miles [804 kilometers] away," said Smith. "That's what these crews are designed to be able to do. They are organized so that they're fully trained, fully ready and fully equipped."The training is grueling: Crews must be ready for field assignments in any type of situation, including those with extreme weather, environmental hazards and primitive living conditions. To prepare, they go on long hikes and practice dropping into remote locations."You run for miles and you put on all of your gear—it's about 40 pounds [18 kilograms]—and you walk straight up the side of a mountain until you get to the top and then you come back down and do it again," explained Frank Carroll, a retired U.S. Forest Service public-information officer and former hotshot squad boss. "You do push-ups and pull-ups and you run some more."Because they are often dropped onto steep terrain, the crews learn how to fight fires using only equipment they can carry with their hands. (See National Geographic's wildfire pictures.)"They don't have big equipment like bulldozers," said Carroll. "They use chainsaws and teamwork to get the job done."Fighting FireA job consists of flying into remote regions with fast-moving fires. The crews figure out how to get in, set up camp, and then construct fire lines to contain the fire. For 12 to 16 hours a day, they dig trenches—down to the mineral soil, where nothing will burn. (Read: What It’s Like Taking Pictures Inside an Inferno)"They act like a machine," said Carroll. "They can cut chain after chain of line—and I should say, a chain is a type of measurement and there's 66 feet [20 meters] to a chain—and together, they can do several chains per hour."Working in tandem, the teams work to construct lines and clear brush away from encroaching fires. It's a demanding and physically exhausting job, one that leaves hotspotters with many muscle aches in the evening."At night, you're basically eating and sleeping," said Smith, remembering the summers he spent fighting fires in Wyoming and Idaho."You're putting in a long, difficult day and you know that tomorrow, you're going to be facing the same thing again. So at the end of the day, you want to eat dinner, have a shower if you can, and go to sleep. You're not thinking about any fears."A Devastating BlowBut there are fears to be had: This is a dangerous job with many serious consequences. From 1990 to 2006, 310 people lost their lives during wildland fire operations in the U.S."I just know that these people—they just keep moving through the summer," said Vicki Minor, executive director of the Wildland Firefighter Foundation, which works with families of the fallen. "They can't stop. If they stopped every time there was a fatality ...""This is devastating," she said. "Our community is nomadic. Our firefighters go everywhere in the United States. They travel from where they sign up to any fires that need them."The firefighting community is a small one—but it's strong and tough, she said. They banded together in 1994 after 14 firefighters lost their lives in the South Canyon Fire on Storm King Mountain, Colorado. They'll come together again this time, for their colleagues in Arizona, she said.But never before has nearly an entire crew been lost, noted the U.S. Forest Service's Carroll."That would be like a platoon of soldiers all getting killed at once," he said. "It's just unheard of."But today, and tomorrow, and the next day, the hotshot crews will be back on the front lines of fire."There are worsening fires happening all across the West," he said. (Read about weather gone wild in National Geographic magazine.)"No matter how many fast airplanes you get, no matter how many troops you get, you need a firefighter with a shovel or a chain saw on the ground, to see if a fire's out, and if it’s not, to put it out,” he says."There’s no amount of equipment that can replace what the hotshots do. Someone has to put the fires out. God does it with rain, or we do it with our hands and our tools."",
"Lightning forks and rejoins itself over Table Mountain and Lion's Head  in Cape Town, South Africa.  Central Africa is the area of the world  where lightning strikes most frequently.Lightning is an electrical discharge caused by imbalances between storm clouds and the ground, or within the clouds themselves. Most lightning occurs within the clouds."Sheet lightning" describes a distant bolt that lights up an entire cloud base. Other visible bolts may appear as bead, ribbon, or rocket lightning.During a storm, colliding particles of rain, ice, or snow inside storm clouds increase the imbalance between storm clouds and the ground, and often negatively charge the lower reaches of storm clouds. Objects on the ground, like steeples, trees, and the Earth itself, become positively charged—creating an imbalance that nature seeks to remedy by passing current between the two charges.Lightning is extremely hot—a flash can heat the air around it to temperatures five times hotter than the sun’s surface. This heat causes surrounding air to rapidly expand and vibrate, which creates the pealing thunder we hear a short time after seeing a lightning flash.Cloud-to-ground lightning bolts are a common phenomenon—about 100 strike Earth’s surface every single second—yet their power is extraordinary. Each bolt can contain up to one billion volts of electricity.A typical cloud-to-ground lightning bolt begins when a step-like series of negative charges, called a stepped leader, races downward from the bottom of a storm cloud toward the Earth along a channel at about 200,000 mph (300,000 kph). Each of these segments is about 150 feet (46 meters) long.When the lowermost step comes within 150 feet (46 meters) of a positively charged object, it is met by a climbing surge of positive electricity, called a streamer, which can rise up through a building, a tree, or even a person.When the two connect, an electrical current flows as negative charges fly down the channel towards earth and a visible flash of lightning streaks upward at some 200,000,000 mph (300,000,000 kph), transferring electricity as lightning in the process.Some types of lightning, including the most common types, never leave the clouds but travel between differently charged areas within or between clouds. Other rare forms can be sparked by extreme forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and snowstorms. Ball lightning, a small, charged sphere that floats, glows, and bounces along oblivious to the laws of gravity or physics, still puzzles scientists.About one to 20 cloud-to-ground lightning bolts is "positive lightning," a type that originates in the positively charged tops of stormclouds. These strikes reverse the charge flow of typical lightning bolts and are far stronger and more destructive. Positive lightning can stretch across the sky and strike "out of the blue" more than 10 miles from the storm cloud where it was born.Lightning is not only spectacular, it’s dangerous. About 2,000 people are killed worldwide by lightning each year. Hundreds more survive strikes but suffer from a variety of lasting symptoms, including memory loss, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and other life-altering ailments. Strikes can cause cardiac arrest and severe burns, but 9 of every 10 people survive. The average American has about a 1 in 5,000 chance of being struck by lightning during a lifetime.Lightning's extreme heat will vaporize the water inside a tree, creating steam that may blow the tree apart. Cars are havens from lightning—but not for the reason that most believe. Tires conduct current, as do metal frames that carry a charge harmlessly to the ground.Many houses are grounded by rods and other protection that conduct a lightning bolt's electricity harmlessly to the ground. Homes may also be inadvertently grounded by plumbing, gutters, or other materials. Grounded buildings offer protection, but occupants who touch running water or use a landline phone may be shocked by conducted electricity.A supercell thunderstorm strikes in South Dakota. Among the most severe storms, supercells can bring strong winds, hail, and even tornadoes. (See more extreme weather pictures.)",
"Celebrity mansions shoot flames from their rooftops like architectural fire pits. Farm animals tied to lifeguard booths crowd beaches lit orange-red by the conflagration. Fleeing motorists drive blindly through walls of flame and black smoke, only to find themselves blocked by abandoned cars on a strip of melting asphalt; on either side, houses ignite, embers pop, flames leap, and burning trees come crashing down. Coroners’ teams sift through the wreckage, enlisting anthropologists to identify shards of bone.California wildfires are setting records again. The Camp Fire in the Northern California foothills and the Woolsey and Hill fires northwest of Los Angeles, all started on Thursday, November 8, as humidity plummeted, and hot, dry winds whipped over vegetation parched by years of drought.Firefighters battle the Woolsey Fire in Malibu, California, on November 12, 2018. That blaze burned nearly 97,000 acres in Southern California, killing three people and damaging an estimated $6 billion in property.As of late Monday, November 12, they had burned a combined 215,000 acres and counting and killed at least 44 people.Paradise, a mountain town of 27,000 in Northern California, has been leveled. The Woolsey Fire in Southern California has burned more than 93,600 acres—146 square miles—in western Los Angeles County and southeastern Ventura County since Thursday, including parts of upscale, beachside Malibu. Residents of Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass-shooting at a country music bar just days before, were among the more than 250,000 forced to evacuate their homes.And still, the fires grow and multiply. If firefighters, climatologists, and California’s governor are correct, these infernos are only a taste of the destruction California will face in the coming years.At about 6:30 a.m. on November 8, firefighters were dispatched to the North Fork of the Feather River in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Burning vegetation had been reported beneath PG&E’s high-tension power lines near the Poe dam. When the first firefighters arrived at the site at 6:43 a.m., they knew they were seeing the beginning of a potential conflagration.California’s Mediterranean climate makes for two seasons: a long dry summer and a mild, wet winter. It’s good for agriculture, but dry summers make for prime wildfire conditions.In the past, autumn rains would have ended Northern California’s fire season more than a month before the Camp Fire started, said meteorologist Craig Shoemaker of the National Weather Service in Sacramento. October 1 is the official beginning of the wet season. But this year was quite different.Hardly any rain had come, and the vegetation was as dry as it normally would be at the height of summer. Shoemaker said that he’s never seen November so dry. “It’s unprecedented. It’s like a matchbox.”At the site of the fire early that morning, firefighters reported 35 mph winds. The winds would peak at 60-70 mph that day, whisking the swelling flames down the Feather River canyon toward the small towns at its base.Winds like that are not abnormal for fall and winter in California, Shoemaker said, when the Great Basin desert is cooler than the California coast. Cooler, high pressure air over Nevada and Utah flows toward the warmer, lower pressure air on the coast, and that creates the wind. Winds forced through narrow gaps in California’s north-south running mountains and down steep canyons move even faster, like water in a narrowing riverbed. As it flows downhill, the air gets hotter and dryer.In Paradise, some residents awoke to the sound of embers raining down on their rooftops. They drove through fire and smoke too thick to see through, colliding with other cars and driving off embankments. Survivors describe the scene of horror in biblical terms. It was as if “the gates of hell had opened up.” “Black and red was all you could see.”Scott McLean arrived in Paradise around 8 a.m. as the fire was already engulfing the southern side of town. McLean is a 21-year veteran of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection—and Cal Fire’s chief spokesperson since 2014—but he was still stunned by what he saw. “Hell,” was the only word he had for it on Sunday.Wrecked and abandoned cars blocked the roadway, said McLean. Everywhere, there were flames, smoke, and wreckage. He thinks it was around 9 o’clock, though he can’t remember for sure, that smoke filled the sky and turned the morning dark as night. As he drove around in search of safe exit routes, he came upon an elderly woman in a wheelchair alone on an empty section of road, pushing herself through the maelstrom.For hours, firefighters could only try to save lives. There was nothing they could do to contain the erratic, wind-whipped blaze.Southern California’s Santa Ana fire season starts in late September. By then, Northern California has usually had enough rain and snow to prevent fires, and their firefighters are available to help out down south. Not this time.At 2 p.m. Thursday, as the Camp Fire continued to rage uncontrolled in and around Paradise, two brush fires broke out 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Stoked by the same hot, dry winds—called Santa Anas in Southern California—they spread.The Hill Fire started in the Santa Rosa Valley, a few miles northwest of Thousand Oaks. Fourteen miles to the east, the Woolsey fire began on a hillside next to the old Santa Susana Field Lab, a hazardous site in Ventura County contaminated by decades of rocket and nuclear reactor testing and a partial meltdown in 1959.At first, the Hill fire was the more worrisome, quickly burning through 140 square miles. But as it entered the 24,000-acre footprint of a major 2013 fire, it had far less fuel to burn. The Woolsey fire took center stage, raging south through the endless suburban sprawl, and jumping the 101 Freeway in several places.It was zero percent contained as it roared through Malibu.At a town hall Sunday evening in Woodland Hills, which straddles the 101 northeast of Malibu, some 350 evacuees packed a high school multipurpose room, many expressing frustration that firefighters couldn’t control the flames.The multi-agency firefighting force in Southern California has been called the most robust in the world. But still, their resources have been strained. Monday, Cal Fire announced that firefighters were being deployed from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and Montana to help fight California’s fires.Last December, the Thomas Fire burned through 281,893 acres (440 square miles) in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. It became the largest wildfire in California's recorded history. Firefighters said they’d never seen anything like it before.That fire was eclipsed just eight months later by the Mendocino Complex fire, which ravaged the wine country in the middle of the state and whipped up a deadly fire tornado, baffling firefighters as well as civilian onlookers. This week, firefighters in Northern California told reporters they’d never seen a fire move so fast as the Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise.As fire officials express awe at the state’s ever more catastrophic blazes, they don’t hesitate to name the reason.“If you live in California it’s evident that we’re in climate change right now,” said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby at a press conference Sunday morning. “Six out of the last seven years we’ve been in a drought. We’ve just experienced the hottest summer on record.”The trend of warmer, dryer autumns precipitating faster, bigger, more dangerous fires is projected to continue indefinitely as greenhouse gases heat the planet.In an op-ed last summer, climate scientist Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote that California’s governor Jerry Brown mischaracterized the recent siege of wildfires when he said they were California’s “new normal.” “It would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau,” Swain said. He urged California's cities and officials to plan for a future of ever-worsening mega-fires.On Sunday Brown revised his catchphrase: “This is not the new normal,” he said. “This is the new abnormal.”",
"A coal train rumbling across Montana is a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) long yet carries barely a day's fuel for a large power plant. The U.S. burns more than a billion tons of coal a year.On a scorching August day in southwestern Indiana, the giant Gibson generating station is running flat out. Its five 180-foot-high (54.9-meter-high) boilers are gulping 25 tons (22.7 metric tons) of coal each minute, sending thousand-degree steam blasting through turbines that churn out more than 3,000 megawatts of electric power, 50 percent more than Hoover Dam. The plant's cooling system is struggling to keep up, and in the control room warnings chirp as the exhaust temperature rises.But there's no backing off on a day like this, with air conditioners humming across the Midwest and electricity demand close to record levels. Gibson, one of the biggest power plants in the country, is a mainstay of the region's electricity supply, pumping enough power into the grid for three million people. Stepping from the sweltering plant into the air-conditioned offices, Angeline Protogere of Cinergy, the Cincinnati-based utility that owns Gibson, says gratefully, "This is why we're making all that power."Next time you turn up the AC or pop in a DVD, spare a thought for places like Gibson and for the grimy fuel it devours at the rate of three 100-car trainloads a day. Coal-burning power plants like this one supply the United States with half its electricity. They also emit a stew of damaging substances, including sulfur dioxide—a major cause of acid rain—and mercury. And they gush as much climate-warming carbon dioxide as America's cars, trucks, buses, and planes combined.Here and there, in small demonstration projects, engineers are exploring technologies that could turn coal into power without these environmental costs. Yet unless utilities start building such plants soon—and lots of them—the future is likely to hold many more traditional stations like Gibson.Last summer's voracious electricity use was just a preview. Americans' taste for bigger houses, along with population growth in the West and air-conditioning-dependent Southeast, will help push up the U.S. appetite for power by a third over the next 20 years, according to the Department of Energy. And in the developing world, especially China, electricity needs will rise even faster as factories burgeon and hundreds of millions of people buy their first refrigerators and TVs. Much of that demand is likely to be met with coal.For the past 15 years U.S. utilities needing to add power have mainly built plants that burn natural gas, a relatively clean fuel. But a near tripling of natural gas prices in the past seven years has idled many gas-fired plants and put a damper on new construction. Neither nuclear energy nor alternative sources such as wind and solar seem likely to meet the demand for electricity.Meanwhile, more than a quarter trillion tons of coal lie underfoot, from the Appalachians through the Illinois Basin to the Rocky Mountains—enough to last 250 years at today's consumption rate. You hear it again and again: The U.S. is the Saudi Arabia of coal. About 40 coal-burning power plants are now being designed or built in the U.S. China, also rich in coal, could build several hundred by 2025.Mining enough coal to satisfy this growing appetite will take a toll on lands and communities. Of all fossil fuels, coal puts out the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy, so burning it poses a further threat to global climate, already warming alarmingly. With much government prodding, coal-burning utilities have cut pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by installing equipment like the building-size scrubbers and catalytic units crowded behind the Gibson plant. But the carbon dioxide that drives global warming simply goes up the stacks—nearly two billion tons of it each year from U.S. coal plants. Within the next two decades that amount could rise by a third.There's no easy way to capture all the carbon dioxide from a traditional coal-burning station. "Right now, if you took a plant and slapped a carbon-capture device on it, you'd lose 25 percent of the energy," says Julio Friedmann, who studies carbon dioxide management at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. But a new kind of power station could change that.A hundred miles (161 kilometers) up the Wabash River from the Gibson plant is a small power station that looks nothing like Gibson's mammoth boilers and steam turbines. This one resembles an oil refinery, all tanks and silvery tubes. Instead of burning coal, the Wabash River plant chemically transforms it in a process called coal gasification.The Wabash plant mixes coal or petroleum coke, a coal-like residue from oil refineries, with water and pure oxygen and pumps it into a tall tank, where a fiery reaction turns the mixture into a flammable gas. Other equipment removes sulfur and other contaminants from the syngas, as it's called, before it's burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity.Cleaning the unburned syngas is cheaper and more effective than trying to sieve pollutants from power plant exhaust, as the scrubbers at a plant like Gibson do. "This has been called the cleanest coal-fired power plant in the world," says Steven Vick, general manager of the Wabash facility. "We're pretty proud of that distinction."The syngas can even be processed to strip out the carbon dioxide. The Wabash plant doesn't take this step, but future plants could. Coal gasification, Vick says, "is a technology that's set up for total CO2 removal." The carbon dioxide could be pumped deep underground into depleted oil fields, old coal seams, or fluid-filled rock, sealed away from the atmosphere. And as a bonus, taking carbon dioxide out of the syngas can leave pure hydrogen, which could fuel a new generation of nonpolluting cars as well as generate electric power.The Wabash plant and a similar one near Tampa, Florida, were built or refurbished with government money in the mid-1990s to demonstrate that gasification is a viable electricity source. Projects in North Dakota, Canada, the North Sea, and elsewhere have tested the other parts of the equation: capturing carbon dioxide and sequestering it underground. Researchers say they need to know more about how buried carbon dioxide behaves to be sure it won't leak back out—a potential threat to climate or even people. But Friedmann says, "For a first cut, we have enough information to say, 'It's a no-brainer. We know how to do this.'"Yet that's no guarantee utilities will embrace the gasification technology. "The fact that it's proved in Indiana and Florida doesn't mean executives are going to make a billion-dollar bet on it," says William Rosenberg of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. The two gasification power plants in the U.S. are half the size of most commercial generating stations and have proved less reliable than traditional plants. The technology also costs as much as 20 percent more. Most important, there's little incentive for a company to take on the extra risk and expense of cleaner technology: For now U.S. utilities are free to emit as much carbon dioxide as they like.Cinergy CEO James Rogers, the man in charge of Gibson and eight other carbon-spewing plants, says he expects that to change. "I do believe we'll have regulation of carbon in this country," he says, and he wants his company to be ready. "The sooner we get to work, the better. I believe it's very important that we develop the ability to do carbon sequestration." Rogers says he intends to build a commercial-scale gasification power plant, able to capture its carbon dioxide, and several other companies have announced similar plans.The energy bill passed last July by the U.S. Congress offers help in the form of loan guarantees and tax credits for gasification projects. "This should jump-start things," says Rosenberg, who advocated these measures in testimony to Congress. The experience of building and running the first few plants should lower costs and improve reliability. And sooner or later, says Rogers, new environmental laws that put a price on carbon dioxide emissions will make clean technology look far more attractive. "If the cost of carbon is 30 bucks a ton, it's amazing the kinds of technologies that will evolve to allow you to produce more electricity with less emissions."If he's right, we may one day be able to cool our houses without turning up the thermostat on the entire planet.",
"Recent drought off Washington State's Pacific coast has been linked to rising sea temperatures.A new scientific analysis of millions of possible climate futures found only a narrow window to keeping global warming to levels the international community has deemed safe.Out of 5.2 million possible climate futures, carbon emissions must reach zero by 2030 in every country in the world if we are to stay at less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100 of warming, the target set by the United Nations to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, from rising seas to deadly heat waves.And unlike last fall’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C” from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—which held out the possibility of a 2.7 degree Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) climate future—the new paper published March 11 in the journal Nature Climate Change employed three practical constraints: spending to cut carbon emissions would be no more than three percent of global GDP per year; no use of geoengineering or technologies to remove carbon; and the climate’s response to doubling carbon in the atmosphere would be at the median level or higher. The latter is called climate sensitivity—how much warming happens when carbon is added to the atmosphere.“We show that our generation has an important responsibility to ensure that coming generations have a tolerable future,” the paper concluded.For comparison, under the 2015 Paris climate agreement if countries meet their pledges, emissions will continue to grow and peak by 2030, putting the world on a path to global warming of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit to 6.3 Fahrenheit (3.0 C to 3.5 C).Global emissions are currently over 40 billion tons a year and increased the last two years. Meanwhile the International Energy Agency announced on March 11 that oil consumption will continue to grow over the next five years, driven by increased demand for jet fuel and petrochemicals.Cutting emissions to zero by 2030 to meet the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) target will be exceptionally difficult, said lead author Jonathan Lamontagne of Tufts University. And there is no path to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit given the constraints used in the paper, he said.That finding echoes the IPCC Special Report, which found the only way to keep global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit was the use of large-scale carbon removal, either from engineered technologies like direct air capture or biomass energy with carbon capture and sequestration, or from natural climate solutions such as afforestation, said Glen Peters, research director at Norway’s Center for International Climate Research. That was also the case for nearly all 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit scenarios, Peters said via email.Lamontagne and colleagues warn that relying on “the massive deployment of new, unproven (carbon removal) technologies may well represent an irresponsible and inappropriate gamble, when the consequences of being wrong are potentially catastrophic.”Large-scale carbon removal, also known as negative emissions, may be unfeasible, but is reducing global emissions to zero by 2030 any more feasible, asked Peters. “We need to explore all options, then society can decide if one or another pathway is more attractive than another,” he said.A new pathway may have opened up: solar geoengineering. High-flying airplanes spraying sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, thereby mimicking gas from volcanoes and reflecting the sun’s heat, could be done safely according to another study in the same issue of Nature Climate Change.While the idea of putting particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight and reduce global warming isn’t new, this is the first study looking at how this might impact rainfall, temperatures, and storms. The paper’s conclusion: solar geoengineering could potentially halve global temperature increases without making climate change worse.Still, big uncertainties remain about solar geoengineering and much more research is needed to understand its risks, costs, and limitations before deployment, acknowledges co-author David Keith of Harvard University. He also warns we still need to rapidly cut carbon emissions.“I’m very nervous about the unintended consequences of this,” says Michael Mann, a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State. Highly idealized experiments on solar geoengineering may not accurately reflect what might actually be used nor the real-world impacts, Mann said in an email.",
"The Swedish city of Kristianstad uses biogas to generate electricity and heat and to fuel cars and municipal garbage trucks and buses. Its two refineries produce enough biofuel to replace 1.1 million gallons of gasoline each year.Biofuels have been around longer than cars have, but cheap gasoline and diesel have long kept them on the fringe. Spikes in oil prices, and now global efforts to stave off the worst effects of climate change, have lent new urgency to the search for clean, renewable fuels.Our road travel, flights, and shipping account for nearly a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, and transportation today remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The idea behind biofuel is to replace traditional fuels with those made from plant material or other feedstocks that are renewable.But the concept of using farmland to produce fuel instead of food comes with its own challenges, and solutions that rely on waste or other feedstocks haven't yet been able to compete on price and scale with conventional fuels. Global biofuel output needs to triple by 2030 in order to meet the International Energy Agency's targets for sustainable growth.There are various ways of making biofuels, but they generally use chemical reactions, fermentation, and heat to break down the starches, sugars, and other molecules in plants. The resulting products are then refined to produce a fuel that cars or other vehicles can use.Much of the gasoline in the United States contains one of the most common biofuels: ethanol. Made by fermenting the sugars from plants such as corn or sugarcane, ethanol contains oxygen that helps a car's engine burn fuel more efficiently, reducing air pollution. In the U.S., where most ethanol is derived from corn, fuel is typically 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol. In Brazil—the second-largest ethanol producer behind the U.S.—fuel contains up to 27 percent ethanol, with sugarcane as the main feedstock.Alternatives to diesel fuel include biodiesel and renewable diesel. Biodiesel, derived from fats such as vegetable oil, animal fat, and recycled cooking grease, can be blended with petroleum-based diesel. Some buses, trucks, and military vehicles in the U.S. run on fuel blends with up to 20 percent biodiesel, but pure biodiesel can be compromised by cold weather and may cause problems in older vehicles. Renewable diesel, a chemically different product that can be derived from fats or plant-based waste, is considered a "drop-in" fuel that does not need to be blended with conventional diesel.Other types of plant-based fuel have been created for aviation and shipping. More than 150,000 flights have used biofuel, but the amount of aviation biofuel produced in 2018 accounted for less than 0.1 percent of total consumption. In shipping, too, adoption of biofuel is at levels far below the 2030 targets set by the International Energy Agency.Renewable natural gas, or biomethane, is another fuel that potentially could be used not only for transportation but also heat and electricity generation. Gas can be captured from landfills, livestock operations, wastewater, or other sources. This captured biogas then must be refined further to remove water, carbon dioxide, and other elements so that it meets the standard needed to fuel natural-gas-powered vehicles.A variety of materials, or feedstocks, can be used to make biofuels. Though corn and sugarcane are well-established ethanol feedstocks, the process of growing the crops, making fertilizers and pesticides, and processing the plants into fuel consumes a lot of energy—so much energy that there is debate about whether ethanol from corn actually provides enough of an environmental benefit to be worth the investment.So scientists and startups are exploring other materials that have the potential to serve as fuel without the accompanying concerns about food supply and environmental impact. Cellulosic ethanol, for example, uses corn stover, wood waste, or other plant material that would not be used otherwise. Other potential biofuel feedstocks include grasses, algae, animal waste, cooking grease, and wastewater sludge, but research continues to find the most efficient and cost-effective ways to transform them into usable fuel.",
"Decomposing plants and other organisms, buried beneath layers of sediment and rock, have taken millennia to become the carbon-rich deposits we now call fossil fuels. These non-renewable fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, supply about 80 percent of the world’s energy. They provide electricity, heat, and transportation, while also feeding the processes that make a huge range of products, from steel to plastics.When fossil fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which in turn trap heat in our atmosphere, making them the primary contributors to global warming and climate change.There are several main groups of fossil fuels, including:Coal: Black or brown chunks of sedimentary rock that range from crumbly to relatively hard, coal began to form during the Carboniferous period about 300 to 360 million years ago, when algae and debris from vegetation in swamp forests settled deeper and deeper under layers of mud. Mined via surface or underground methods, coal supplies a third of all energy worldwide, with the top coal consumers and producers in 2018 being China, India, and the United States. Coal is classified into four categories—anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite–depending on its carbon content.An iceberg melts in the waters off Antarctica. Climate change has accelerated the rate of ice loss across the continent.Carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal account for 44 percent of the world total, and it's the biggest single source of the global temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. The health and environmental consequences of coal use, along with competition from cheap natural gas, have contributed to its decline in the U.S. and elsewhere. But in other places, such as India, demand is expected to rise through 2023.Oil: Crude oil, a liquid composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, is often black, but exists in a variety of colors and viscosities depending on its chemical composition. Much of it formed during the Mesozoic period, between 252 and 66 million years ago, as plankton, algae, and other matter sank to the bottom of ancient seas and was eventually buried.Extracted from onshore and offshore wells, crude oil is refined into a variety of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, and heating oil. The top oil-producing countries are the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Russia, which together account for nearly 40 percent of the world's supply.Petroleum use accounts for nearly half the carbon emissions in the U.S. and about a third of the global total. In addition to the air pollution released when oil is burned, drilling and transport have led to several major accidents, such as the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, the devastating Lac Megantic oil train derailment in 2013, and thousands of pipeline incidents. Nonetheless, oil demand continues to rise, driven not only by our thirst for mobility, but for the many products—including plastics—made using petrochemicals, which are generally derived from oil and gas.Natural gas: An odorless gas composed primarily of methane, natural gas often lies in deposits that, like those for coal and oil, formed millions of years ago from decaying plant matter and organisms. Both natural gas and oil production have surged in the U.S. over the past two decades because of advances in the drilling technique most people know as fracking.By combining fracking—or hydraulic fracturing—with horizontal drilling and other innovations, the fossil-fuel industry has managed to extract resources that were previously too costly to reach. As a result, natural gas has surpassed coal to become the top fuel for U.S. electricity production, and the U.S. leads the world in natural gas production, followed by Russia and Iran.Natural gas is cleaner than coal and oil in terms of emissions, but nonetheless accounts for a fifth of the world's total, not counting the so-called fugitive emissions that escape from the industry, which can be significant. Not all of the world’s natural gas sources are being actively mined. Undersea methane hydrates, for example, where gas is trapped in frozen water, are being eyed as a potential gas resource.Governments around the world are now engaged in efforts to ramp down greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels to prevent the worst effects of climate change. At the international level, countries have committed to emissions reduction targets as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, while other entities—including cities, states, and businesses—have made their own commitments. These efforts generally focus on replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and electrifying sectors such as transportation and buildings.However, many sources of carbon emissions, such as existing power plants that run on natural gas and coal, are already locked in. Considering the world's continuing dependence on fossil fuels, many argue that in addition to efforts aimed at replacing them, we also need to suck carbon from the air with technologies such as carbon capture, in which emissions are diverted to underground storage or recycled before they reach the atmosphere. A handful of commercial-scale projects around the world already capture carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of fossil fuel-fired plants, and while its high costs have prevented wider adoption, advocates hope advances in the technology will eventually make it more affordable.",
"Characteristic of the Carboniferous period (from about 360 million to 300 million years ago) were its dense and swampy forests, which gave rise to large deposits of peat. Over the eons the peat transformed into rich coal stores in Western Europe and North America. The name "Carboniferous" refers to this coal.The Carboniferous period, part of the late Paleozoic era, takes its name from large underground coal deposits that date to it. Formed from prehistoric vegetation, the majority of these deposits are found in parts of Europe, North America, and Asia that were lush, tropically located regions during the Carboniferous.In the U.S., scientists divide the Carboniferous into two parts: the earlier Mississipian (359.2 million to 318.1 million years ago) and the later Pennsylvanian (318.1 million to 299 million years ago).During the Mississipian, Euramerica, or Laurussia, which included North America, northern Europe, and Greenland, remained separate from the larger, cooler supercontinent of Gondwana to the south. To the east, parts of Asia, including China, were surrounded by warm oceans. While Gondwana became progressively colder as it began another poleward migration, the tropical landmasses remained wet and humid.Carboniferous coal was produced by bark-bearing trees that grew in vast lowland swamp forests. Vegetation included giant club mosses, tree ferns, great horsetails, and towering trees with strap-shaped leaves. Over millions of years, the organic deposits of this plant debris formed the world's first extensive coal deposits—coal that humans are still burning today.The growth of these forests removed huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, leading to a surplus of oxygen. Atmospheric oxygen levels peaked around 35 percent, compared with 21 percent today. It also may explain the giant creepy-crawlies that now emerged—the size reached by insects and similar creatures is thought to be limited by the amount of air they are able to breathe.Deadly poisonous centipedes some six feet (two meters) in length crawled in the company of mammoth cockroaches and scorpions as much as three feet (one meter) long. Most impressive of all were dragonflies that grew to the size of seagulls. One exquisitely detailed fossil of a dragonfly that died 320 million years ago shows it had a wingspan of 2.5 feet (0.75 meters).How insects first became airborne remains a mystery. Theories suggest their wings may have developed from structures used to regulate temperature (such as by catching the sun's rays to heat up), or perhaps they evolved from brightly colored signals used to attract mates and ward off rivals. Another idea is that insect wings developed from appendages used to glide between trees in the Carboniferous forests.Amphibians were also growing in size and diversity. There were predatory species that resembled modern-day crocodiles. Armed with vicious teeth, they reached lengths of almost 20 feet (6 meters). Some amphibians developed a thicker, scaly skin, solving the problem of them drying out if away from water too long. They also reduced their reliance on wetland habitats through a crucial evolutionary adaptation known as the amniote egg. This protected the embryo inside with a fluid-retaining membrane while still allowing in air. In time, the earliest reptiles appeared. Identified from remains found inside fossilized Carboniferous tree stumps, they were small, agile, lizard-like animals.Africa collided with eastern North America in the late Pennsylvanian, an event that formed the Appalachian Mountains. Vast coal swamps stretched across the lowlands to the west of the rising mountains.By the end of the Carboniferous, the Earth's landmasses were moving toward a single, global supercontinent called Pangaea.",
"On December 22, ten years to the day after a dike ruptured at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant near Kingston, Tennessee, pouring more than a billion gallons of toxic coal ash into the Emory River, TVA took out a full-page ad in the local paper to congratulate itself and its contractors on a cleanup job well done. That same day, about 150 of the workers who actually cleaned up the spill gathered at the site, which is now a park with hiking trails, boat ramp, and ball fields. Standing in blue jeans and work boots near a homemade wooden cross, they commemorated a different aspect of the cleanup: their 36 coworkers who’ve died from brain cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and other diseases.Some of the survivors walked with canes. Most bore blisters from the arsenic buried in their skin. Nearly all carried inhalers in their pockets. TVA's ad did not mention them.More than 900 workers cleaned up the coal ash spill at the Kingston plant, which is operated by the Tennesee Valley Authority; more than 200 have sued Jacobs Engineering, the cleanup contractor. Doug Bledsoe is one: He was recently diagnosed with brain and lung cancer, shortly after his wife battled breast cancer.Frankie Norris displays the burning sores he still has and began getting soon after he started working on the cleanup a decade ago. He and other workers say they were refused protective equipment, even simple dust masks.Angie Shelton sits at home in Decatur, Tennessee, on December 22, 2018, the 10th anniversary of the coal ash spill. Shelton's husband worked on the cleanup and later died of cancer.More than 200 cleanup workers and family members are now suing TVA's main contractor, Jacobs Engineering, for refusing to provide them with protective equipment and for causing their debilitating and in some cases deadly diseases. Last November they won the first phase of the trial: A federal jury agreed that Jacobs had failed to protect them and that exposure to coal ash could have caused their illnesses.While the world focuses on coal's carbon-dioxide emissions, which are a leading driver of climate change, the Kingston spill and its aftermath highlight a far more immediate problem: What to do with the millions of tons of coal ash piled up in 1,400 unlined landfills and ponds around the U.S. Most of those dumps lie near lakes or rivers or above freshwater aquifers that supply drinking water to nearby communities.The 5.4 million cubic yards of sludge that broke through a 57-foot earthen dike at Kingston was the largest industrial spill in the nation's history—nearly ten times the size of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill two years later in the Gulf of Mexico. The wave of wet ash smothered some 300 acres around the plant and dozens of houses in the small community of Swan Pond, before turning several miles of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers, as well as parts of the Watts Bar Reservoir into a lumpy gray chowder.TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant, built in 1955, was the largest coal-burning power plant in the world for more than a decade, and it still burns 14,000 tons of pulverized coal, or 140 rail-car loads, each day. About 10 percent of the coal, the non-combustible part, becomes coal ash—powdery fly ash that collects in smokestack filters, and coarser bottom ash and boiler slag that gets flushed out of the plant's furnaces. The ash is a mix of clays, quartz, and other minerals, forged into tiny glass-like beads by the heat of the fire.But it also concentrates dozens of naturally occurring heavy metals, including known carcinogens and toxins such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, vanadium, chromium, as well as radioactive uranium and radon. These metals pose the greatest health threat from coal ash. Even without a catastrophic spill, they can leach into and contaminate groundwater. Attached to fine particles of ash they can drift through the air, blowing onto skin and into nostrils.Some coal ash particles are so fine—less than 2.5 microns in diameter, a 30th the width of a human hair—that they can be sucked deep into the lungs and become a health hazard even without toxic hitchhikers. PM 2.5, as such particles are called, are also in smog, smoke, and auto exhaust, and they’re a known cause of numerous respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and a significant cause of global mortality."TVA has given my husband a death sentence," says Janie Clark, whose husband Ansol Clark built the cross for the memorial this past December. "They gave him an incurable blood disease and destroyed his heart. Coal ash is a dirty dark secret that has gone on in this state and this country way too long. It needs to be brought to light."A wooden cross at the site of the Kingston spill honors cleanup workers who got sick and died.Survivors who gathered at the site on the tenth anniversary of the spill laid flowers on the cross.The survivors gathered to commemorate their 36 coworkers who've died from cancer and other diseses. Cleanup workers were chronically exposed to fine, airborne particles of coal ash laced with toxic heavy metals.Utilities have long maintained that coal ash is as safe as sand (which is mostly silicon dioxide, and far coarser than ash) and that its trace concentrations of toxins are not much higher than background levels in the soil."In your backyard you may have 20 to 50 parts per million (ppm) of arsenic depending on where you live," says John Kammeyer, TVA's vice-president for civil projects, who was in charge of engineering for the cleanup. "You don't eat the dirt in your backyard because there's arsenic in it. Drinking water standards are about ten ppm. In the coal ash at Kingston it's 70 ppm, but there's no evidence that any of this got into drinking water. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, EPA, and Vanderbilt all tested the birds and fish to see if there was any impact. They concluded we didn't do any harm."Sixty-three years after it opened, ten years after the disastrous spill, the Kingston Fossil Plant is still burning 14,000 tons of coal a day—and producing about 1,400 tons of coal ash.The Kingston cleanup workers, however, were heavily exposed to airborne ash. More than 900 people worked on the site between 2008 and 2015, operating the giant dredges, track-hoes, bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment to remove the ash from the river, dry it in windrows, and ship it in rail cars to a lined landfill near Uniontown, Alabama.Ansol Clark was one of the first to arrive at the site on December 22, 2008. A 57-year-old professional truck driver, he’d just gotten a clean bill of health on his Department of Transportation physical. For the next five years he worked as a fuel-truck driver at the site, putting in 15-hour days, often seven days a week, keeping the big earth-moving machines running.After two years he started having breathing problems, runny nose, and coughing. Then he started getting dizzy spells. One day he got up to go to work and collapsed on the bedroom floor.The doctors told him he had arrhythmia, that his heart wasn't getting enough oxygen. They gave him medicine, and he went back to work. Then he started having black-out spells. Eventually he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. A few months after he was forced to quit, he suffered a massive stroke. He recovered, but has since been diagnosed with polycythemia vera, a rare blood cancer. His doctors say it was likely caused by radiation from the ash."After Jacobs took over [the cleanup] at three months, they started telling us everything was safe," says Clark, who is now 67. "And we worked in a blue haze for months. When we started piling it up and the dust started blowing, they said it was pollen. Take an allergy pill and you'll be fine in a week. They'd tell us you can eat a pound of it every day and it won't hurt you."Ansol Clark was one of the first to arrive at the site on December 22, 2008. He suffers from congestive heart failure and a rare blood cancer that could have been caused by radiation from the ash, which contains uranium and radon.Several of Clark's coworkers had similar experiences. Frankie Norris of Albany, Kentucky, was 47 when he began driving bulldozers, track-hoes, and fuel trucks at the site. After six months he began having trouble using the bathroom. His blood pressure spiked, and he got burning sores on his skin. After four years he was laid off for his illnesses. In 2016 his colon ruptured, sending him into the ICU for 19 days, where he almost died."Was it dusty? Lord yes," says Norris. "Every time those air brakes went off it'd blow dust in your face. I was in dust constantly for 10 to 12 hours a day. I went up with some other guys and we asked for dust masks. They told us there wouldn't be no dust masks. Safety guy told us we'd get fired for even asking for one."Norris says he thought about quitting, but he had a wife and three kids to support. It was the depths of the recession, and the cleanup jobs paid more than $20 an hour. There were men standing in line for them."I needed the work," Norris said. "I wanted to get my kids through school. But I didn't expect TVA to kill us."Tommy Johnson, seen here with his wife Betty at their home in Knoxville, was another first responder. He suffers from chronic cough and shortness of breath.TVA, which is a federal agency, is not currently involved in the workers’ lawsuit against Jacobs Engineering, although it may be on the hook for its contractor's legal fees, according to its own 2018 annual report. During the trial, several epidemiologists testified to the health impacts of the constituents of coal ash. According to Barry Levy of Tufts University, a leading expert in environmental health, just six of the toxins in Kingston's coal ash-—fine particulates, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, vanadium and naturally occurring radioactive materials—could cause many of the worker's illnesses."These hazardous substances are well established as causing a wide variety of adverse health effects in humans," Levy wrote in his report, "including cancer, respiratory disorders, neurologic disorders and various other diseases."Arsenic alone, for example, has been shown to cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, and skin cancer, among many other diseases experienced by the cleanup workers. The combination of toxins may also be more dangerous than any single one alone, according to Levy. There are more than 20 toxins in Kingston's coal ash.Court documents show TVA and Jacobs asking EPA to lower worker-safety standards; hidden video taken by the workers show company representatives tampering with personal air monitors and testing equipment. All that evidence suggests there was a concerted effort by TVA and Jacobs to downplay the dangers of coal ash, says Jamie Satterfield, an investigative reporter for the Knoxville News-Sentinel who has covered the story extensively over the years. The motive, she says, was to reassure the public that coal ash wasn’t a threat."It was a PR thing," says Satterfield. "The public was mad as hell. There were lots of public meetings, with parents asking, 'Are my kids in danger?' TVA sent a clear command to Jacobs: First, no coal ash on any trucks or equipment leaving the site; so they built a million-dollar car wash. Second, no one in respirators or Tyvek suits. The manager for Jacobs told people not even to wear dust masks.Downtown Kingston on December 22, 2018.In his home in Powell, Tennessee, Doug Bledsoe, who suffers from both brain and lung cancer, holds a bag of his medications."These are hard-working, blue-collar, decent people," says Satterfield, who has interviewed hundreds of cleanup workers. "They knew nothing about the dangers. After the spill everybody came in, senators, the environmental groups, all worried about the impact on the community, walking right by these workers in T-shirts and no protective gear who were working in the coal ash day in, day out. No one was paying attention to them."Neither TVA officials nor Jacobs Engineering would comment on the ongoing litigation, although in court Jacobs denied any wrongdoing. TVA's Kammeyer also denied any concerted effort to downplay the danger of coal ash. "I know of no [PR] campaign," he says. "My engineers put cameras up to monitor it and make sure we were meeting our standards for air quality, keeping the dust down. So I know we were doing all the right things."TVA has refused to release any video footage of the worksite, although local environmental activists captured video of at least one major dust storm at the cleanup in 2009. TVA's own independent inspector general, Richard Moore, slammed the agency for avoiding transparency and accountability as part of its legal strategy after the spill. Moreover, in a 111-page report on the cause of the spill released in 2009, Moore blasted the agency for "irresponsible coal ash practices" that led to numerous seeps and breeches in its ash ponds dating back to 1980.App Brian Thacker looks out of his home in Clinton, Tennessee. Thacker developed a multitude of medical issues after working on the Kingston cleanup. He says he was fired for asking for a dust mask.TVA isn't the only utility with an ash problem. In February 2014, a storm drain at a 50-year-old ash pond owned by Duke Energy collapsed near Eden, North Carolina, disgorging 39,000 tons of ash and 27,000 gallons of polluted water into the Dan River. Only a fraction of the ash was recovered, and contaminants were detected 70 miles downstream. Last year Hurricane Florence flooded two other Duke ash ponds in eastern North Carolina, resulting in smaller releases.Such disasters are thankfully rare, but researchers say the greater issue is the sheer ubiquity of coal ash around the nation. Though its share of the fuel mix is declining, coal still generates nearly 30 percent of the electricity in the United States, creating more than 100 million tons of ash each year—the largest industrial solid waste stream in the country. There are more than 1,000 active coal ash landfills and ponds in the United States, and hundreds of retired ash dumps. Most are unlined holes in the ground.Roughly 60 percent of coal ash is recycled, according the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA), generating about $23 billion in revenue each year for utilities. Most goes into concrete and cement, but ash has also been used in roadbeds, as fill under housing developments and golf courses, even for snow control or as fertilizer on agricultural land.Jeff Brewer stands outside of the Kingston plant on the tenth anniversary of the spill. Like many cleanup workers he has serious medical conditions that began when he was working with coal ash every day. "They told us it wouldn't hurt us," he says.After the Kingston spill, environmental groups advocated regulating coal ash as hazardous waste. But the utilities and ACAA lobbied hard against the move, arguing that it would dry up the market for recycling and just create more coal ash. EPA instead passed its first regulation on coal ash storage, requiring that all new coal ash landfills be lined (although existing unlined landfills can still be used), and that companies test groundwater around the ash ponds.The industry-generated data were released last March: They revealed groundwater contamination at 95 percent of the tested sites. The utilities are required to retest, then clean up the contamination and even close the site if it continues. The Trump Administration is now attempting to roll back those regulations as too burdensome, allowing states to end groundwater monitoring and other requirements."It's not just one toxin," says Avner Vengosh, a geochemist at Duke University who studied both the Kingston and Dan River spills. "It's a cocktail of arsenic, copper, lead, selenium, thallium, antimony, and other metals at higher levels than in their natural state. People think coal ash is not going to be a problem because utilities are switching to natural gas and it's cleaner. But the legacy of coal ash production and disposal is going to be with us for ages. These contaminants don't biodegrade."For Jeff Brewer, 44, of New Market, Tennessee, he and his coal-ash coworkers were little more than expendable guinea pigs. He started working on the Kingston cleanup as a healthy man in his mid-30s, and after four years in the pit he was on two blood-pressure pills, a fluid pill, and a steroid inhaler; he was getting a testosterone shot every two weeks. He's been diagnosed with liver dysfunction and obstructive lung disease. Every few minutes he's racked by a harsh barking cough."It was like sucking the life out of you," Brewer says. "If I knew what I know today, I'd have picked up cans on the side of the road. But I had a wife and three girls and I needed to provide for them. And they told us it wouldn't hurt us. You could eat a pound of it every day."While the Kingston workers' exposure was extreme, they were the canaries in the coal-ash mine. Until all the ash ponds and landfills are cleaned up—and we stop burning coal—the risk to U.S. drinking water supplies remains. The next phase of the Kingston trial, in which individual workers will attempt to prove their illnesses were caused by coal ash exposure, will begin later this year.",
"An oil skimming operation works in a heavy slick near Latouche Island in the southwest end of Prince William Sound, Alaska, on April 1, 1989, a week after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground.“My eyes were watering from the oil fumes even at 1,000 feet,” recalled Rick Steiner, who flew over the Exxon Valdez oil tanker on March 24, 1989, only hours after it had plowed into a cold-water reef. “Oil was all over the deck, and it was everywhere in the water,” said Steiner, who was the University of Alaska's marine advisor in the Prince William Sound region at the time.The Exxon Valdez was the worst oil spill in U.S. waters until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Within days oil from the Exxon Valdez spread some 1,300 miles along the coast of what was pristine wilderness. In the first days of the spill there was no oil recovery or clean-up equipment in the water, said Steiner, who is now a marine conservation consultant at the “Oasis Earth” project.Eventually, massive clean-up efforts involving thousands of people were undertaken. The final death toll included 250,000 seabirds, almost 3,000 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, 22 killer whales, and billions of salmon eggs. Populations of pacific herring, a cornerstone of the local fishing industry, collapsed. Fishermen went bankrupt.It’s impossible to fully clean up an oil spill in the ocean, said Steiner, who’s been involved in many spills since 1989. And the impacts of these disasters can linger for decades. Thirty years later, local populations of killer whales and some seabirds in Prince William Sound have still not recovered, he said.Some of the oil is still there, too. Recent sampling along the coast revealed pockets of oil buried four to eight inches under sand and gravel, often topped by stones. It’s likely to remain there for decades to come, according to a 2017 study by Jacqueline Michel, a geochemist specializing in oil spills, and president of Research Planning Inc.A powerful storm or earthquake could potentially put that oil residue back into Prince William Sound, Michel said. However, digging up those residues to remove them would likely do more harm than good, she added.In the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster, the U.S. Congress passed a law, in 1990, that required oil tankers in U.S. waters to have double hulls (unlike that fateful ship) and increased penalties for spills. Today, all of the world’s fleet of 12,000 to 14,000 tankers for oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and chemicals are double hulled.Combined with tougher regulations and better navigation equipment, oil spills releasing more than seven tons from tankers plummeted from a high of 79 spills per year in the 1970s to six per year over the past decade, according to ITOPF, an association of shipowners that responds to oil spills.The decline in large spills greater than 700 tons was even more dramatic, falling from 24.5 per year to just two per year.Perhaps surprisingly, given its notoriety and impact on the shipping industry, the Exxon Valdez spill was only the 36th worst tanker oil spill yet recorded. The biggest between 1970 and 2018 happened in 1979, off the coast of Tobago in the West Indies when the Atlantic Empress lost 287,000 tons of crude in a collision with another tanker. For comparison, the Valdez lost 37,000 tons. (There is roughly 305 gallons in a metric ton of oil.)The worst tanker accident in the past 25 years occurred in January 2018, when two tankers collided off the coast of China. An Iranian oil tanker, the Sanchi, lost 117,000 tons of highly toxic natural gas condensate. None of Sanchi's 32 crew members survived.By far the biggest accidental spill into the ocean was from the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. At 35,000 feet, it was the deepest well ever drilled until the blow out that killed 11 workers. Over nearly 90 days the broken well pumped 680,000 tons (approximately 5 million barrels) of oil into the Gulf. The spill cost oil company BP an estimated $61.6 billion, and they still couldn’t contain or recover all the oil that was spilled, said Michel, who worked on the project to assess some of the impacts.Marine oil spill containment and recovery technology improved tremendously after the Valdez, but not much has changed for at least the last decade, the experts say. Spills can be located faster and their movements modelled more accurately, but full containment and cleanup remains, impossible Michel said.It can also be difficult to prevent an undersea oil well from leaking. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan destroyed an oil platform in the Gulf operated by Taylor Energy. It’s still leaking 15 years later. Taylor is reported to have spent over $400 million working alongside the U.S. Coast Guard to contain and clean up the spill, but it’s been an ongoing challenge.More and more oil drilling is being done offshore in deepwater off the U.S. and around the world. Last year, the Trump administration proposed opening up far more offshore areas to drilling.“Oil platform drilling in deeper water is the new paradigm of risk for oil spills in the marine environment,” said Michel.",
"The use of hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from the earth dates back to the 1940s, but only in the past few years has "fracking" become an energy buzzword, alluding primarily to the shale gas boom in the United States and all of the controversy that has accompanied it. Fracking-the high-pressure injection of water, chemicals and sand into shale deposits to release the gas and oil trapped within the rock-in recent years has been combined with horizontal drilling and other improvements in technology to harvest stores of gas and oil that previously were thought commercially unfeasible to access. (See interactive: "Breaking Fuel from the Rock")The implications of this sea change are debatable, but the impact is undeniable. In the United States, oil production last year reached its highest level in 14 years, thanks in part to output from North Dakota's Bakken Shale, and is expected to keep rising. Natural gas production, already at new highs thanks to shale gas, is expected to grow 44 percent in the U.S. between 2011 and 2040. (See "Natural Gas Nation: EIA Sees U.S. Future Shaped by Fracking.")Now countries around the world, including China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, are eyeing shale development as the potential key to unlock a similar windfall of homegrown energy. Debate rages on about whether these worldwide reserves can be tapped safely, and whether environmental damage from fracking natural gas will outweigh the gains from using a fuel that is cleaner than oil or coal, but remains a fossil fuel nonetheless. A few viewpoints on both sides of the issue follow."The United States is in the midst of the 'unconventional revolution in oil and gas' that, it becomes increasingly apparent, goes beyond energy itself. Today, the industry supports 1.7m jobs - a considerable accomplishment given the relative newness of the technology. That number could rise to 3 million by 2020. In 2012, this revolution added $62 billion to federal and state government revenues, a number that we project could rise to about $113 billion by 2020.2 It is helping to stimulate a manufacturing renaissance in the United States, improving the competitive position of the United States in the global economy, and beginning to affect global geopolitics." —Daniel Yergin, vice chair of global consulting firm IHS, in February testimony before Congress"Natural gas is not a permanent solution to ending our addiction imported oil. It is a bridge fuel to slash our oil dependence while buying us time to develop new technologies that will ultimately replace fossil transportation fuels. Natural gas is the critical puzzle piece RIGHT NOW. It will help us to keep more of the $350 to $450 billion we spend on imported oil every year at home, where it can power our economy and pay for our investments in a smart grid, wind and solar energy, and increased energy efficiency. By investing in alternative energies while utilizing natural gas for transportation and energy generation, America can decrease its dependence on OPEC oil, develop the cutting-edge know-how to make wind and solar technology viable, and keep more money at home to pay for the whole thing." —Pickens Plan, a site outlining BP Capital founder T. Boone Pickens' proposed energy strategy"My town was dying. This is a full-scale mining operation, and I'm all for it. Now we can get back to work." —Brent Sanford, mayor of Watford City, a town at the center of the North Dakota oil boom, in "The New Oil Landscape" (NGM March 2013 issue)"According to a number of studies and publications GAO reviewed, shale oil and gas development poses risks to air quality, generally as the result of (1) engine exhaust from increased truck traffic, (2) emissions from diesel-powered pumps used to power equipment, (3) gas that is flared (burned) or vented (released directly into the atmosphere) for operational reasons, and (4) unintentional emissions of pollutants from faulty equipment or impoundment-temporary storage areas. Similarly, a number of studies and publications GAO reviewed indicate that shale oil and gas development poses risks to water quality from contamination of surface water and groundwater as a result of erosion from ground disturbances, spills and releases of chemicals and other fluids, or underground migration of gases and chemicals."—General Accounting Office report on shale development, September 2012"The gas 'revolution' has important implications for the direction and intensity of national efforts to develop and deploy low-emission technologies, like [carbon capture and storage] for coal and gas. With nothing more than regulatory policies of the type and stringency simulated here there is no market for these technologies, and the shale gas reduces interest even further. Under more stringent GHG targets these technologies are needed, but the shale gas delays their market role by up to two decades. Thus in the shale boom there is the risk of stunting these programs altogether. While taking advantage of this gift in the short run, treating gas a 'bridge' to a low-carbon future, it is crucial not to allow the greater ease of the near-term task to erode efforts to prepare a landing at the other end of the bridge."—from a study on shale gas and U.S. energy policy by researchers at MIT (also see: "Shale Gas: A Boon That Could Stunt Alternatives, Study Says")"Oil is a rental business. ...When the industry goes south, and it will go south, they just walk away." —Dan Kalil, charman of the Williams County Board of Commissioners in North Dakota, in "The New Oil Landscape" (NGM March 2013 issue)",
"In any discussion about climate change, renewable energy usually tops the list of changes the world can implement to stave off the worst effects of rising temperatures. That's because renewable energy sources such as solar and wind don't emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.Clean energy has far more to recommend it than just being "green." The growing sector creates jobs, makes electric grids more resilient, expands energy access in developing countries, and helps lower energy bills. All of those factors have contributed to a renewable energy renaissance in recent years, with wind and solar setting new records for electricity generation.For the past 150 years or so, humans have relied heavily on coal, oil, and other fossil fuels to power everything from light bulbs to cars to factories. Fossil fuels are embedded in nearly everything we do, and as a result, the greenhouse gases released from the burning of those fuels have reached historically high levels.As greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere that would otherwise escape into space, average temperatures on the surface are rising. Global warming is one symptom of climate change, the term scientists now prefer to describe the complex shifts affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts.Of course, renewables—like any source of energy—have their own trade-offs and associated debates. One of them centers on the definition of renewable energy. Strictly speaking, renewable energy is just what you might think: perpetually available, or as the U.S. Energy Information Administration puts it, "virtually inexhaustible." But "renewable" doesn't necessarily mean sustainable, as opponents of corn-based ethanol or large hydropower dams often argue. It also doesn't encompass other low- or zero-emissions resources that have their own advocates, including energy efficiency and nuclear power.Hydropower: For centuries, people have harnessed the energy of river currents, using dams to control water flow. Hydropower is the world's biggest source of renewable energy by far, with China, Brazil, Canada, the U.S., and Russia the leading hydropower producers. While hydropower is theoretically a clean energy source replenished by rain and snow, it also has several drawbacks.Large dams can disrupt river ecosystems and surrounding communities, harming wildlife and displacing residents. Hydropower generation is vulnerable to silt buildup, which can compromise capacity and harm equipment. Drought can also cause problems. In the western U.S., carbon dioxide emissions over a 15-year period were 100 megatons higher than they normally would have been, according to a 2018 study, as utilities turned to coal and gas to replace hydropower lost to drought. Even hydropower at full capacity bears its own emissions problems, as decaying organic material in reservoirs releases methane.Dams aren't the only way to use water for power: Tidal and wave energy projects around the world aim to capture the ocean's natural rhythms. Marine energy projects currently generate an estimated 500 megawatts of power—less than one percent of all renewables—but the potential is far greater. Programs like Scotland’s Saltire Prize have encouraged innovation in this area.Wind: Harnessing the wind as a source of energy started more than 7,000 years ago. Now, electricity-generating wind turbines are proliferating around the globe, and China, the U.S., and Germany are the leading wind energy producers. From 2001 to 2017, cumulative wind capacity around the world increased to more than 539,000 megawatts from 23,900 mw—more than 22 fold.Some people may object to how wind turbines look on the horizon and to how they sound, but wind energy, whose prices are declining, is proving too valuable a resource to deny. While most wind power comes from onshore turbines, offshore projects are appearing too, with the most in the U.K. and Germany. The first U.S. offshore wind farm opened in 2016 in Rhode Island, and other offshore projects are gaining momentum. Another problem with wind turbines is that they’re a danger for birds and bats, killing hundreds of thousands annually, not as many as from glass collisions and other threats like habitat loss and invasive species, but enough that engineers are working on solutions to make them safer for flying wildlife.Solar: From home rooftops to utility-scale farms, solar power is reshaping energy markets around the world. In the decade from 2007 and 2017 the world's total installed energy capacity from photovoltaic panels increased a whopping 4,300 percent.In addition to solar panels, which convert the sun's light to electricity, concentrating solar power (CSP) plants use mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat, deriving thermal energy instead. China, Japan, and the U.S. are leading the solar transformation, but solar still has a long way to go, accounting for around two percent of the total electricity generated in the U.S. in 2017. Solar thermal energy is also being used worldwide for hot water, heating, and cooling.Biomass: Biomass energy includes biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, wood and wood waste, biogas from landfills, and municipal solid waste. Like solar power, biomass is a flexible energy source, able to fuel vehicles, heat buildings, and produce electricity. But biomass can raise thorny issues.Critics of corn-based ethanol, for example, say it competes with the food market for corn and supports the same harmful agricultural practices that have led to toxic algae blooms and other environmental hazards. Similarly, debates have erupted over whether it's a good idea to ship wood pellets from U.S. forests over to Europe so that it can be burned for electricity. Meanwhile, scientists and companies are working on ways to more efficiently convert corn stover, wastewater sludge, and other biomass sources into energy, aiming to extract value from material that would otherwise go to waste.Geothermal: Used for thousands of years in some countries for cooking and heating, geothermal energy is derived from the Earth’s internal heat. On a large scale, underground reservoirs of steam and hot water can be tapped through wells that can go a mile deep or more to generate electricity. On a smaller scale, some buildings have geothermal heat pumps that use temperature differences several feet below ground for heating and cooling. Unlike solar and wind energy, geothermal energy is always available, but it has side effects that need to be managed, such as the rotten egg smell that can accompany released hydrogen sulfide.Cities, states, and federal governments around the world are instituting policies aimed at increasing renewable energy. At least 29 U.S. states have set renewable portfolio standards—policies that mandate a certain percentage of energy from renewable sources, More than 100 cities worldwide now boast at least 70 percent renewable energy, and still others are making commitments to reach 100 percent. Other policies that could encourage renewable energy growth include carbon pricing, fuel economy standards, and building efficiency standards. Corporations are making a difference too, purchasing record amounts of renewable power in 2018.Wonder whether your state could ever be powered by 100 percent renewables? No matter where you live, scientist Mark Jacobson believes it's possible. That vision is laid out here, and while his analysis is not without critics, it punctuates a reality with which the world must now reckon. Even without climate change, fossil fuels are a finite resource, and if we want our lease on the planet to be renewed, our energy will have to be renewable.",
"A chef picks "farm fresh" produce from an unusual source—a rooftop apple orchard planted among the high-rises of downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. The Fairmont Waterfront hotel project showcases two large sectors of the growing green-jobs movement: food production and green building.Green roof gardens can deliver locally sourced foods that help protect the environment by minimizing the use of pesticides, fossil fuels, and other resources to grow and transport food to market from larger commercial farms. Green roofs can also improve the urban environment by insulating buildings against energy loss, managing storm water, improving air quality, and providing places of recreation.—Brian Handwerk(See more Rio+20 and Sustainable Earth content)",
"Jackson Lake Dam in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park was built in 1906 to provide water to farmers and ranchers. Many older dams are now being rethought.Humans have been harnessing the energy of river currents for centuries, using water wheels spun by rivers initially to process grains and cloth. Today, hydropower provides about 16 percent of the world's electricity, generating power in all but two U.S. states.Hydropower became an electricity source in the late 19th century, a few decades after British-American engineer James Francis developed the first modern water turbine. In 1882, the world’s first hydroelectric power plant began operating in the United States along the Fox River in Appleton, Wisconsin.A typical hydroelectric plant is a system with three parts: a power plant where the electricity is produced, a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow, and a reservoir where water is stored. The water behind the dam flows through an intake and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to turn. The turbine spins a generator to produce electricity.The amount of electricity that can be generated depends on how far the water drops and how much water moves through the system. The electricity can be transported through long-distance electric lines to homes, factories, and businesses. Other types of hydropower plants make use of the flow through a waterway without a dam.China, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and Russia are the five largest producers of hydropower. The world's largest hydroelectric plant in terms of installed capacity is Three Gorges (Sanxia) on China's Yangtze River, which is 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) wide and 607 feet (185 meters) high. The facility that actually generates the most electricity annually is the Itaipu plant situated on the ‎Paraná River between Brazil and Paraguay.The biggest hydropower plant in the United States is at the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington, a state that gets about two-thirds of its electricity from hydropower.Hydropower has several advantages. Once a dam has been built and the equipment installed, the energy source—flowing water—is free. It's a clean fuel source renewed by snow and rainfall. Hydropower plants can supply large amounts of electricity, and they are relatively easy to adjust for demand by controlling the flow of water through the turbines.The Gila River snakes through New Mexico's Gila National Forest. This free-flowing river is drying up due to overuse and climate change altering snowpack. It faces a potentially massive project that would divert water away from the upper New Mexico portion of the river.But big dam projects can disrupt river ecosystems and surrounding communities, harming wildlife and forcing out residents. The Three Gorges Dam, for example, displaced an estimated 1.2 million people and flooded hundreds of villages.Dams also prevent fish such as salmon from swimming upstream to spawn. While equipment such as fish ladders are designed to help salmon go up and over dams and enter upstream spawning areas, such measures aren't always effective. In some cases, fish are collected and trucked around the obstacles. Still, the presence of hydroelectric dams can often change migration patterns and hurt fish populations. In the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest, for example, salmon and steelhead have lost access to about 40 percent of their historic habitat because of dams.Hydropower plants can also cause low dissolved oxygen levels in the water, which is harmful to river habitats. Other wildlife can be affected as well: In Indonesia, a hydroelectric project threatens rare Tapanuli orangutans because it stands to fragment their habitat.Climate change and the increased risk of drought are also having an impact on the world's hydropower plants. In the western U.S., carbon dioxide emissions over a 15-year period were 100 megatons higher than they normally would have been, according to a 2018 study, as utilities turned to coal and gas to replace hydropower lost to drought.Even the promise of carbon-free electricity from hydropower has been undermined by revelations that decaying organic material in reservoirs releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.However, some argue that the environmental impacts of hydroelectric power can be mitigated and remain low compared with burning fossil fuels. In some places, small hydro projects can take advantage of existing water flows or infrastructure. Special water intakes and turbines can help make sure water released from a dam is better aerated to address the problem of low dissolved oxygen. Dams can be planned more strategically to allow fish passages, for example, while water flows at existing dams can be calibrated to give ecosystems more recovery time from flooding cycles. And research continues on ways to make hydropower projects more friendly to the ecosystems around them.A growing movement is also working to tear down dams that are no longer functioning or needed around the world, with the aim at restoring more natural rivers and the many benefits they provide to wildlife and people, including recreation.",
"Using enough explosives to level 400 ten-story buildings, China demolished the last barrier holding back the mighty Yangtze River from the Three Gorges Dam on Tuesday, according to government- controlled media.At 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) long, Three Gorges is one of the world's largest dams, and one of the most controversial public works in modern times.Demolition experts used some 200 tons (181 metric tons) of explosives to destroy the final Three Gorges cofferdam—a temporary construction that had allowed builders to finish the dam's massive main wall.The blast created some 243,278 cubic yards (186,000 cubic meters) of concrete rubble.The main dam's construction was completed last month amid much fanfare."This is the grandest project the Chinese people have undertaken in thousands of years," Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Corporation, told the London Times on May 20.At its peak the construction team numbered some 26,000 Chinese and foreign employees.(Get China maps, facts, photos, music, and more.)Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, first suggested a dam on the Yangtze River in central China's Hubei Province. He believed the structure could protect river communities from deadly floods.Communist leader Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) also supported the concept, but construction didn't begin until 1993, 17 years after Mao's death.The project will flood the three gorges that give the dam its name: the Qutang, Wu Xia, and Xiling. They stretch for some 124 miles (200 kilometers) along the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and are renowned for their scenic beauty.The dam is some 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) long and 607 feet (185 meters) tall—five times larger than the U.S.'s Hoover Dam.Construction workers used some 21 million cubic yards (16 million cubic meters) of concrete in the structure—a world record.Upstream of the dam, the reservoir's water level is presently 456 feet (139 meters) above sea level, and it's expected to rise quickly. The 410-mile-long (660-km-long) reservoir will eventually be flooded to 574 feet (175 meters) above sea level. [Learn how ships are lifted up the face of the dam].Chinese state media reports that over a hundred workers died during the lengthy construction project.Economic costs also ran high. Official reports place the price tag in the 24-billion-U.S.-dollar range. Critics say that actual costs could be several times the stated amount.The dam's 410-mile-long (660-kilometer-long) reservoir will flood about 244 square miles (632 square kilometers) of land—including well over a thousand towns and villages.Some 1.3 million people (another disputed number) have been or will be relocated.The Three Gorges plan includes compensation for the dispossessed, such as payments and new homes and jobs. But these efforts have been plagued by widespread local corruption and complaints that funds aren't reaching the intended recipients.Dozens of architectural and cultural sites will also disappear under the reservoir. Among the most notable are relics of the ancient Ba people, who lived in the region some 4,000 years ago.Chinese authorities estimate that some 300,000 people were killed in the 20th century's largest Yangtze River floods.Officials believe that the dam will protect some 15 million people from such deadly waters, as well as 1.5 million acres (607,000 hectares) of farmland.The wall is built to weather floods of a once-in-a-century severity. But some scientists have expressed concern about earthquake activity in the area, and the unlikely event of a breach could have catastrophic consequences.Environmentalists have warned that the dam will reduce downstream nutrient and sediment flow and seriously impact neigboring river and seacoast ecosystems.A study published in the April 2006 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters suggests that such changes may already be underway.Researchers reported that ratios of silicon to nitrogen in brackish coastal waters fell from 1.5 in 1998 to 0.4 in 2004. Sediment loading was found in places to be half of pre-dam levels.Such changes could harm plentiful coastal fishing grounds and subject tidal wetlands to increased erosion.Twenty-six turbines (scheduled for operation in 2008) are designed to produce more than 18,000 megawatts of electricity—twenty times the power of Hoover Dam.In 1993 that figure was thought sufficient to provide an amazing 10 percent of China's total energy needs. During years of construction, however, the nation's growing appetite for power has reduced that number to perhaps 3 percent of the current demand.Last year some 44 million tons (40 million metric tons) of cargo were transported via the Three Gorges Dam. That's up from 14.75 million tons (13.4 million metric tons) in 2003, when the reservoir first began storing water.Dam proponents stress that the dam will be a boost for Yangtze River trade, which accounts for some 80 percent of China's inland shipping.Higher water levels will allow larger vessels to ply the river, travel faster, and motor from Shanghai, at the river's estuary, all the way to Chongqing, on the Yangtze's upper reaches.The dam has so far blocked an estimated ten million tons of plastic bags, bottles, animal corpses, trees, and other detritus that otherwise would have flowed out to sea.Engineers have created an interesting solution to prevent the trash from damaging power generators—a giant garbage-lapping "tongue."The Shanghai Daily reports that a rolling track, like a moving sidewalk, will feast on the refuse from its platform atop a garbage boat. Engineers say that the device can consume some 392 cubic yards (300 cubic meters) of garbage an hour.But the tongue may be useless against another form of pollution—contaminated water.The reservoir flooded factories, mines, dumps, and other potentially toxic sites. Volumes of human waste and industrial refuse flow into the now dammed river from communities like Chongqing, and some environmentalists warn of serious water contamination issues.So far, the Chinese government's Yangtze River Water Resources Committee says, water qualities upstream of the dam have remained unchanged since natural water flow was stopped in 2003. Authorities tout new treatment facilities targeted at reducing the level of pollutants entering the water.The controversies surrounding Three Gorges Dam are sure to be played out again, because the Chinese dambuilding business is booming.Three Gorges may itself necessitate the building of several new dams."Ultimately the life of this dam is very limited, unless they build other dams to prevent it from silting up," said Jennifer Turner, coordinator of the China Environment Forum at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.In other words, Three Gorges could become clogged along its upstream wall with sediment that would normally be washed downriver and out to sea."There are a dozen more dams planned further upstream, and they want to end up at Tiger Leaping Gorge. That's significant in terms of the future destruction of parts of the river that are free flowing," Turner said."Tiger Leaping Gorge is an area that's symbolic of China. It's like the Grand Canyon."China already boasts the world's largest number of dams—86,000 and counting. The debate over where and how others are built could have huge consequences for China's rivers and beyond."In general, the central government has tried to push for more public participation but [the federal government is] not a monolith," Turner said, noting the often primary importance of regional and local officials."It's hard, but who knows? The dam issue could lead to more openness in environmental policy and decision-making in China."",
"Technically it’s ancient technology. But now the two-millennia-old principle of the Greek mathematician Archimedes has been deployed at gargantuan scale. The Three Gorges Dam, China’s marvel on the Yangtze River, is one of the world’s largest engineering projects—the product of 37 million cubic yards of concrete. Its final feature, inaugurated in late 2016, is a new ship lift, a hydraulic seesaw that raises and lowers vessels as many as 371 feet to traverse the dam.Archimedes’ notion was simple: The weight of a buoyant object is equal to the weight of water it displaces. Take two identical chambers filled with equal amounts of water. They will balance on a scale. Add an object—e.g., a ship—to one of them, and let water of an equal weight out. The two chambers will remain balanced. Remove water from one chamber, and that chamber will slowly rise.A system designed to accommodate ships up to 3,000 metric tons is a little more complex. The dam first opened with a series of locks, similar to the Panama Canal’s. The new ship lift raises and lowers boats using cables, a basin, motors—and simple gravity. Concrete counterweights in addition to water keep the system balanced, as do high-tech safety stops.The China Three Gorges Corporation, which designed the lift with German engineers, expects several benefits: lower power needs, a rise in shipping capacity, increased passenger traffic, and lower carbon emissions—plus, the universal currency of time. A crossing that once spanned three to four hours via locks now takes just 40 minutes.",
"The Gila River snakes through New Mexico's Gila National Forest. This free-flowing river is drying up due to overuse and climate change altering snowpack. It faces a potentially massive project that would divert water away from the upper New Mexico portion of the river.These ten U.S. rivers are particularly endangered, according to a new report from the conservation group American Rivers.For the past 34 years, the organization has advocated to protect major rivers from threats like dam construction, pollution, and climate change. This year, New Mexico's Gila River (pronounced hee-la) was chosen as the most endangered. The river is negatively impacted by diminishing snow pack and advocates say plans to divert significant portions of the river would exacerbate climate change impacts.“It will be significantly damaged in the near future unless action is taken,” says Chris Williams, the senior vice president of communication at American Rivers.The Gila is one of New Mexico's most treasured rivers. It's ancient, having been a source of freshwater for indigenous people for more than a thousand years. It's the namesake of the Gila minnow and the Gila monster (a venom-packing lizard), and the river itself supports a number of endangered species.It's hailed as one of the nation's last “wild” rivers—allowed to flow undeterred by human-made structures. To the New Mexicans ardently trying to protect it, the Gila River is both a scenic natural sanctuary and a historic water source.“The community has a cultural and spiritual connection to the river,” says lawyer Don Pongrace, from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Pongrace has represented the federally recognized Gila Indian River Community on water issues since 1997.The diversion planned for New Mexico, Pongrace says, would significantly impact water availability for native Gila communities downstream in Arizona.On April 12, New Mexico's Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed funding for the river diversion, but Williams says American Rivers maintains their stance on listing the Gila River as America's most endangered because special interests are still advocating to divert river water away from upstream channels.More than $66 million dollars from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is motivating the fight for control over the river's future. In 2004, Congress passed the Arizona Water Settlement Act, which officially authorized the New Mexico Unit of the Central Arizona Project (CAP) to divert water from the upper Gila River. To receive their funding in full, New Mexico CAP must get approval from the Interior Department by this year.The timeliness of the 2019 deadline is partially why American Rivers included the Gila on their list.“[The list] is really aimed at rivers that the public can do something about,” says Williams.Climate change, he notes, is something they also want the public to be aware of. Along with the Gila, they credit changing climate conditions for endangering the Hudson River in New York and the Upper Mississippi, which flows through Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri.As an example of how the public can be successful, the organization is designating Ohio's Cuyahoga River as the “River of the Year.”Fifty years ago, the river was so polluted it caught fire. Today it's heralded as an environmental success story.",
"Sumatra's Tapanuli orangutan is a new species of great ape that was identified in 2017. Just 800 of these extremely wary tree-dwelling apes remain in the wild, and a hydroelectric power plant and dam are being built in their remaining habitat.The world’s rarest great ape, discovered only in 2017, will not survive the building of a $1.6 billion hydroelectric power plant and dam in the middle of its remaining habitat in Sumatra, Indonesia, wildlife experts warn.Only 800 of the newly identified Tapanuli orangutans remain in the wild, all in northern Sumatra’s Batang Toru Forest. It’s one of the most biodiverse spots in Indonesia, home to such rare species as Sumatran tigers and the critically endangered Sunda pangolin.In this same area, forest clearing has already begun for the hydro project, which is being financed and built by state-controlled Chinese companies under China’s Belt and Road project. This multi-trillion-dollar initiative involves more than 7,000 infrastructure projects around the world.Indonesia's largest environmental group, the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, filed suit to stop the dam, providing evidence that the environmental impact behind the project was deeply flawed. There have also been reports of other irregularities in the process; one scientist involved in the assessment said that his signature was forged to obtain a key permit. But on March 4, the three-judge panel ruled against the motion, arguing that the environmental organization’s complaints were irrelevant.The group plans to appeal. "We will take all available legal channels," Dana Prima Tarigan, the group's executive director for North Sumatra, told the Associated Press.It was just over a year ago when the world learned that a new great ape species had been discovered. Although researchers have studied it since 2005, it took them that long to definitely identify the Tapanuli orangutan as genetically and physically distinct from the Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii), the other two species. (See: New species of orangutan Is rarest great ape on Earth)There is no way this project should be built where these tree-dwelling apes live, says Bill Laurance of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science at Australia’s James Cook University. The dam and power plant—and all the associated roads, electrical lines, an eight-mile-long tunnel, and other infrastructure—will permanently fragment the animal’s habitat, Laurance says."They’re a critically endangered species and could rapidly go extinct with any further fragmentation of the primary forest," says Laurance, a world expert on the impacts of habitat fragmentation. "The science is solid on this. It’s lunacy to go ahead with this project."A road is the same as an impassible wall to an exclusively arboreal, or tree-dwelling, species, Laurance says. Over the course of more than 3,000 hours of observations, scientists have never observed the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) touching a foot to ground—likely because of the presence of the endangered Sumatran tiger.It took years to habituate a few Tapanuli orangutans to observers’ presence in the forest, says Gabriella Fredriksson, a wildlife biologist with the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme. Normally this takes a few weeks, but the orangutans are extremely wary, she says, likely because local people have hunted them. It also took a long time to find a full skeleton to measure. That revealed significant differences compared to the other two species, such as a smaller skull.The estimated 800 apes are already split into three populations over a 420-square-mile area. Only one of these, with 500 individuals, is considered large enough to remain viable.One problem for maintaining a population is that orangutans are extremely slow breeders. Females have their first offspring at around 15 years of age, giving birth to one or, more rarely, two individuals every eight to nine years. That’s one reason, Fredriksson says, why researchers have been trying for years to reconnect the three populations.And now a hydropower dam is being built in the orangutans’ most critical habitat, an area with the highest densities of individuals. The state-owned area has no conservation or other protections. The dam will bring roads and other infrastructure permanently fragmenting the habitat of the one viable population of 500, and pushing the species towards extinction, Fredriksson says.North Sumatera Hydro Energy, the Indonesian company behind the project, has told Indonesian media that the hydro power plant won’t be in primary forest and that much of the 650 hectares of land disrupted will be returned to a near-original state. “These claims are ridiculous, and the company should be castigated for trying to confuse the public about the rock-solid scientific conclusions,” says Laurance. Both the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank refused to support the same project, largely on environmental grounds, he says.The Batang Toru dam is scheduled to be operational in 2022, generating 510 megawatts of electricity. It involves blasting a tunnel eight miles long and more than 30 feet wide through a rugged region of primary forest. The dam is also unusual in that it will store water for 18 hours and then release this deluge for six-hour spans during peak periods to generate electricity. These sudden pulses of water will have big impacts on the Batang Toru river and downstream communities, such as flooding and halting migration of the highly valued Jurung fish, Fredriksson says.Experts question the need for such a project. Not only does Sumatra currently have excess electricity production, there is a geothermal electricity project nearby that could be expanded without impacting orangutans, she says. Moreover, the dam is being built in a region prone to dangerous earthquakes, such as the 2016 Aceh temblor that killed 100 people.Scientists have appealed directly in a hand-delivered letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo to halt the hydropower project and protect the Tapanuli orangutan habitat. Avaaz, a global activist organization, has more than 1.3 million signatures on an online petition asking President Widodo to cancel the project in order to protect the orangutans.“The fate of this entire species rests in your hands,” the message reads in part. Avaaz plans to do more to alert the world to what is happening in Sumatra, an organizer from the group says.“I think the government is starting to wake up to the issue,” Fredriksson says.",
"Orangutans, those lovable orange apes of Southeast Asia, are in trouble. In July, the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared both Sumatran and Bornean orangutans critically endangered—the last stop before they become extinct in the wild.According to the World Wildlife Fund, Bornean orangutans in the wild number around 54,000, while Sumatran orangutans only number around 7,300.To celebrate these animals’ beauty and improve conservation efforts, a group of nonprofits founded International Orangutan Day on August 19. The great apes’ primary threat is the rapid deforestation of their habitats. With the global demand for palm oil growing exponentially, forests are being slashed and burned to make way for plantations. Without their home, orangutans have a hard time bouncing back, as they only reproduce every six to eight years.The word “orangutan” comes from the Malay language, meaning “man of the forest.” Keep clicking for 13 photos of orangutans in the wild, in rehab centers, and in zoos. From snacking to snuggling, it’s easy to see what we have in common with them. (Related: “Orangutans Are More Like Us Than You Think.”)",
"In 1963, the floodgates closed on the newly constructed Glen Canyon Dam near the Arizona-Utah border, locking the waters of the Colorado River behind its concrete face. The water pooled behind the dam, slowly filling in the vast canyon—and the maze of slot canyons and grottoes feathering around its edges. Only a few years later, Glen Canyon was transformed from the sandstone cradle of the tumbling Colorado River into the deep, still, ~250-square mile Lake Powell.Environmentalists and native communities mourned the loss of the gorgeous and culturally significant places drowned under the new lake. Over the years, Glen Canyon’s lost splendor took on a nearly mythical status, and river acolytes held out hope that they would one day see the waters recede.In the 2000s, as the West sank into a drought, the water levels behind the Glen Canyon Dam started dropping. Bathtub rings showing the high-water marks hovered stories above the heads of boaters and water skiers. And as the water level dropped, some of the old majesty of the side canyons and tributaries started being exposed once again.In 2017, water levels in the lake were predicted to drop to their lowest point ever. For Taylor Graham, a filmmaker and kayaker who grew up hearing stories about the beauty of the drowned side canyons, the opportunity was clear: This was his moment to see the fabled lost beauty of Glen Canyon. So he rounded up a bevy of friends and colleagues, packed up a fleet of kayaks, and set out on a 42-day-long paddle down the Colorado River, ending at the Glen Canyon Dam itself.Graham’s short film about the experience, “Glen Canyon Rediscovered,” was released today. National Geographic called him on the phone to ask him about the trip, making the film, and what Glen Canyon means for the American West.Growing up in the Southwest, I spent a lot of time with my family and friends on rivers, kayaking and rafting. You always hear the story of this place, how it's this lost world that we can no longer venture to because it's covered by the waters of Lake Powell.And then recently, because of climate change and the fact that we've overallocated the Colorado River and used it to such a degree, the lake has started retreating. The level has dropped enough that all these side canyons I'd heard all these stories about are starting to re-emerge.So there's this question: what is happening to these canyons that I thought I'd never see in my lifetime? What do they look like now that the lake is retreating from them? This trip was really an opportunity to go and explore some of these stories and these places and see what they're like, as they are resurrected from the reservoir.  Why is Glen Canyon important?Because it was so beautiful, and also because so few folks had the opportunity to experience it before it was submerged. It's also the place that really jump-started the modern environmental movement as we know it. People like David Brower [ed: the first director of the Sierra Club] and Katie Lee [ed: an activist who focused her attention on Glen Canyon]—these big environmental names in the West—fought to protect this canyon from being dammed. When they lost that battle and the Glen Canyon Dam was built, it really launched this modern consciousness of protecting our wild places in the West.  The last time the reservoir was full was in the 1990s, after a couple of big snow years. Since then, it has been on a downward trajectory, since the Colorado River is used completely and because now we're seeing the impacts of climate change dwindling the flow of all the rivers in the West.There's been a growing discussion about whether there is an opportunity to remove the dam and see this place come back to its original splendor. That idea began as a bit of a hope and dream for environmentalists and people like me who wanted to see the river alive again, but as the realities of climate change have become more pressing, there's a lot of talk about this actually being something good for the Colorado River and good for our water management in the West.  Why did you want to take this particular trip? Why now?It felt like a really important time to return to this place, because the lake levels were dropping and these canyons reemerging.For the expedition, we thought we could get to know those canyons in the best way possible by spending time in sea kayaks, moving along through the canyons at a much slower pace than people usually do when they’re going along in speedboats on Lake Powell.And also, we decided to start up in Moab, higher up on the Colorado River, and then paddle down through Cataract Canyon, one of the wildest and most rapid-filled stretches of the Colorado, to where the river meets Lake Powell. We were looking forward to the opportunity to see this massive river, this undammed stretch of the Colorado, turn into the reservoir, and to see what that transition looked like.  Were there any places along your route that you were particularly interested in seeing?   [One place] I was most keen on exploring is called Cathedral in the Desert. It was written about by Katie Lee and Edward Abbey and explored by John Wesley Powell in his initial voyage down the Colorado in the late 1800s. It's this wonderful, beautiful place that is submerged by water now—but not completely. When the reservoir is at its lowest extent, the floor of this place comes out, and the plants start growing again. It epitomizes the transition that Lake Powell is going through now.  Was there anything you saw on this trip that surprised you in some way?  One of the biggest surprises for me was the fact that, contrary to a lot of the discussion around the building of Glen Canyon Dam, there were actually communities of people who lived and worked along the river in the area that was submerged. Floyd Dominy, who was the head of the Bureau of Reclamation at the time the dam was built, famously said it was a great place for a reservoir because we didn't have to move any towns and didn’t have to submerge any dwellings: other than a couple of beavers there was nothing there. But we spent time on the Navajo Nation and Southern Paiute lands and spoke with people whose orchards and family lands and summer dwellings had been submerged by the reservoir, often without any compensation—or even notification—by the government.  Tell me about some of the emotional moments of the trip.  One of the things we all noticed as we we were working our way down the reservoir was that there's this wonderful transition you go through as you leave the lake. First, you walk into the muddy, squelchy side canyon. Then, as you hike further up, it turns into this wonderful recovered canyon with a trickling stream. All the plants are growing again and the birds are singing: It's this wonderful experience.But then, after seeing that, you really realize how unnatural the reservoir is. It's hard to say that Lake Powell isn't beautiful, with its blue waters abutting the red sandstone. But when you spend time in the side canyons, as they are in their natural state, and then go back down to the reservoir, you realize how silent it is—how eerie and unnatural that setting really is. That feeling built as we went through the expedition.  What did it feel like when you finally saw the dam, on the last day of your trip?Actually seeing the dam, putting a face to it, made me realize its impermanence. Dams have a finite lifespan. So seeing it gave me hope that, at some point in the future, these canyons are all going to recover. Try as we might, humankind can't permanently alter the landscapes around us.  That's the reality that climate change is showing us: at some point, there’s just not enough water to keep all these dams full. So maybe someday, the Colorado will run free through Glen Canyon again.",
"The sun sets over Lower Lewis River Falls in Washington State’s Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The falls mark a wild and scenic stretch of the river, but other sections of the Lewis, which drains the state’s mighty Cascade Range, boast large dam and reservoir systems.Hydroelectric plants produce power, but they’ve changed the river’s natural character—to the special detriment of migratory fish like salmon. Utilities have agreed to begin trucking fish around the dams along the Lewis River, moving them from below these looming barriers to prime habitat upstream, above the dams.",
"Water levels dipped to historic lows in California's lakes and reservoirs in 2014. At the Folsom Dam in California, levels were down at about 40 percent of its total capacity.During the darkest days of the drought that has gripped the western U.S. since the early 2000s, fires raged and crops withered. Dust storms rolled across plains and valleys. And rivers shriveled from north to south.But the drought had less obvious effects on climate and the environment, too: Low river flows drastically hampered the amount of carbon-free electricity that could be produced by the thousands of hydroelectric power plants dotted along rivers and reservoirs across the West.(Learn more about how the West is drying out, slowly but surely.)Now, a group of researchers has done the carbon math to see how big that effect was. They figured out that an extra 100 megatons of carbon ended up in the atmosphere because utilities had to use carbon-emitting power sources instead of hydroelectric power during drought, added up over the 15 years they studied. That’s the equivalent of adding about 1.4 million cars to the road for every one of those years.“That’s a sizable slice of the pie,” says Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford and one of the authors of the study, which was published Friday in Environmental Research Letters.  In a normal year, a little more than 20 percent of the electricity produced across the western U.S. comes from hydroelectric plants. But that number fluctuates with the ebb and flow of water. And when water is scarce, the amount of energy produced by those plants plummets.  But people need lights and heat and air conditioning in a drought as much (and sometimes more) than they do in times of water plenty. If energy utilities can't get the power they need from hydroelectric sources, they have to fill that gap with something else. Most of the time, the researchers found, the utilities fell back on carbon-emitting sources like natural gas and coal to fill their power needs.It’s not ideal, but it makes sense, says Amir AghaKouchak, a civil and environmental engineer at the University of California, Irvine.“Under drought conditions, the priority is to use water for people and cities, and managers might prefer to burn gas for energy,” he says. “Because you have alternatives for getting energy from different sources—but you don't have alternatives for water.”States like California, Washington, and Oregon that rely heavily on hydroelectric power during water-rich years were the hardest hit. And the climate costs were large. In California, for instance, the extra carbon dioxide emitted because of the drought added up to more than seven percent of its total carbon emissions. In Oregon and Washington, the extra emissions made up about 10 percent of their total.That’s far from insignificant. Many of the western states have set out plans for how to aggressively reduce their emissions over the next few decades. California, for instance, is trying to get its emissions down to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. But drought bumps all the western states strongly in the wrong direction, making it harder for them to meet their emissions reduction goals.Over the past decade, the western U.S. experienced some of the worst periods of drought it’s seen in centuries. Now, some scientists think that the American Southwest is settling in to a “megadrought”—a drought that lingers on for at least 20 years. And forecasts for the future predict that dry places are likely to get even drier, stressing out the hydroelectric system even further.  “Droughts are going to get worse, and that could mean more natural gas and coal being burned,” says Peter Gleick, a water expert at the Pacific Institute, a research organization in Oakland. “And that's a positive feedback—which in climate change is a bad thing.”It’s easy to get caught in this positive feedback loop, he says—but the more aware of it managers are, the better able they’ll be to plan their way out of it.AghaKouchak points out that the carbon cost of this particular stretch of drought, in this particular place, is large—but at any given point, many different regions of the world are in their own water-stressed states. “And if you add up the cumulative impact of all these extreme events on CO2 emissions,” he says, before pausing. “Well. It's way beyond what you may think.”But Diffenbaugh points out that with this study and a slew of others from the past few years, we’ve learned more and more about when and why carbon-free energy sources struggle. Armed with this information, he says, and with ever improving forecasting of coming stresses on the system like drought, energy managers can figure out how to fill the gaps in energy demand with more renewables.",
"Solar energy is the technology used to harness the sun's energy and make it useable. As of 2011, the technology produced less than one tenth of one percent of global energy demand.Many are familiar with so-called photovoltaic cells, or solar panels, found on things like spacecraft, rooftops, and handheld calculators. The cells are made of semiconductor materials like those found in computer chips. When sunlight hits the cells, it knocks electrons loose from their atoms. As the electrons flow through the cell, they generate electricity.On a much larger scale, solar-thermal power plants employ various techniques to concentrate the sun's energy as a heat source. The heat is then used to boil water to drive a steam turbine that generates electricity in much the same fashion as coal and nuclear power plants, supplying electricity for thousands of people.The sun has produced energy for billions of years. Every hour the sun beams more energy onto Earth than it needs to satisfy global energy needs for an entire year.In one technique, long troughs of U-shaped mirrors focus sunlight on a pipe of oil that runs through the middle. The hot oil then boils water for electricity generation. Another technique uses moveable mirrors to focus the sun's rays on a collector tower, where a receiver sits. Molten salt flowing through the receiver is heated to run a generator.Other solar technologies are passive. For example, big windows placed on the sunny side of a building allow sunlight to heat-absorbent materials on the floor and walls. These surfaces then release the heat at night to keep the building warm. Similarly, absorbent plates on a roof can heat liquid in tubes that supply a house with hot water.Solar energy is lauded as an inexhaustible fuel source that is pollution- and often noise-free. The technology is also versatile. For example, solar cells generate energy for far-out places like satellites in Earth orbit and cabins deep in the Rocky Mountains as easily as they can power downtown buildings and futuristic cars.Solar energy doesn't work at night without a storage device such as a battery, and cloudy weather can make the technology unreliable during the day. Solar technologies are also very expensive and require a lot of land area to collect the sun's energy at rates useful to lots of people.Despite the drawbacks, solar energy use has surged at about 20 percent a year over the past 15 years, thanks to rapidly falling prices and gains in efficiency. Japan, Germany, and the United States are major markets for solar cells. With tax incentives, and efficient coordination with energy companies, solar electricity can often pay for itself in five to ten years.",
"Geothermal energy has been used for thousands of years in some countries for cooking and heating. It is simply power derived from the Earth’s internal heat.This thermal energy is contained in the rock and fluids beneath Earth’s crust. It can be found from shallow ground to several miles below the surface, and even farther down to the extremely hot molten rock called magma.These underground reservoirs of steam and hot water can be tapped to generate electricity or to heat and cool buildings directly.A geothermal heat pump system can take advantage of the constant temperature of the upper ten feet (three meters) of the Earth’s surface to heat a home in the winter, while extracting heat from the building and transferring it back to the relatively cooler ground in the summer.Geothermal water from deeper in the Earth can be used directly for heating homes and offices, or for growing plants in greenhouses. Some U.S. cities pipe geothermal hot water under roads and sidewalks to melt snow.To produce geothermal-generated electricity, wells, sometimes a mile (1.6 kilometers) deep or more, are drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that drive turbines linked to electricity generators. The first geothermally generated electricity was produced in Larderello, Italy, in 1904.There are three types of geothermal power plants: dry steam, flash, and binary. Dry steam, the oldest geothermal technology, takes steam out of fractures in the ground and uses it to directly drive a turbine. Flash plants pull deep, high-pressure hot water into cooler, low-pressure water. The steam that results from this process is used to drive the turbine. In binary plants, the hot water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water. This causes the secondary fluid to turn to vapor, which then drives a turbine. Most geothermal power plants in the future will be binary plants.Geothermal energy is generated in over 20 countries. The United States is the world’s largest producer, and the largest geothermal development in the world is The Geysers north of San Francisco in California. In Iceland, many of the buildings and even swimming pools are heated with geothermal hot water. Iceland has at least 25 active volcanoes and many hot springs and geysers.There are many advantages of geothermal energy. It can be extracted without burning a fossil fuel such as coal, gas, or oil. Geothermal fields produce only about one-sixth of the carbon dioxide that a relatively clean natural-gas-fueled power plant produces. Binary plants release essentially no emissions. Unlike solar and wind energy, geothermal energy is always available, 365 days a year. It’s also relatively inexpensive; savings from direct use can be as much as 80 percent over fossil fuels.But it has some environmental problems. The main concern is the release of hydrogen sulfide, a gas that smells like rotten egg at low concentrations. Another concern is the disposal of some geothermal fluids, which may contain low levels of toxic materials. Although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades, eventually specific locations may cool down.",

"An autonomous glider floats about two miles off Atlantic City, after being deployed by a team from Rutgers University. Researchers are using the glider to sample ocean pH to help them understand how increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is boosting levels of ocean acidity in the water.Atlantic City, NJGrace Saba steadies herself on the back of a gently rocking boat as she and her crew slide a six-foot long yellow torpedo into the sea. A cheer erupts as the device surfaces, turns on its electronic signal, and begins a three-week journey along the New Jersey coast.“It’s taken seven years to get this done,” said Saba, who has been working on this experiment since 2011. “I’m so happy, I think I might cry!”Saba is an assistant professor of marine ecology at Rutgers University, where she is studying how fish, clams, and other creatures are reacting to rising levels of ocean acidity. Acidification is a byproduct of climate change; a slow but exorable real-life experiment in which industrial emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are absorbed and then undergo chemical reactions in the sea. Rising ocean acidity has already bleached Florida’s coral reefs and killed valuable oysters in the Pacific Northwest.Now scientists like Saba want to know what might happen to animals that live in the Northeast, a region home to commercially important fishes, wild stocks of quahogs (clams), scallops, and surf clams that can't swim away from growing acidic waters."They are just stuck there,” Saba said.Saba’s torpedo-like instrument is actually an underwater drone, known as a Slocum glider, that is carrying an ocean acidity sensor. This is the first time that oceanographers have married the two technologies—glider and pH sensor—to get a big-picture view of changes underway in the commercially important fishing grounds of the Northeastern United States.The glider will travel 130 miles from Atlantic City to the edge of the underwater continental shelf and back. It will complete a series of dives to the ocean bottom, sampling water temperature, salinity, and pH as it swims. The glider will feed Saba and colleagues data on changing water chemistry more quickly than the testing conducted every four years by seagoing oceanographic vessels.Saba and Rutgers graduate student Liza Wright-Fairbanks are hoping to compare ocean pH measurements to coastal fish spawning grounds. Developing fish and shellfish larvae are most vulnerable to rising ocean acidity.“We don’t know much about pH throughout the entire water column, especially here along the East Coast and the commercial fisheries here,” said Wright-Fairbanks. “They bring in so much money to the country, but if the shellfish can’t survive than neither can the fishermen.”Scientists say the pH level of the world’s seas have already dropped—on average from 8.2 to 8.1 on the pH scale (lower numbers are more acidic). That’s a 26 percent drop in the past century (because the pH scale is logarithmic). But as the ocean absorbs more industrial emissions of carbon dioxide, its pH is expected to double to 7.7 pH units by the end of the century, according to Aleck Wang, professor of marine chemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.The result is that, by 2100, “you are going to start seeing calcium carbonate shells dissolve,” Wang said. “It’s not going to be that far away.” By killing such critical shelled organisms as corals, oysters, and many plankton, acidic waters may upend the ocean food chain.Fishermen in the Gulf of Maine are already seeing seasonal changes in ocean acidity that could one day threaten a seafood harvest worth more than $600 million to Maine’s economy. Further south in the Mid-Atlantic region, seafood harvesters worry about their future as well.“We are all trying to figure out the right path forward,” said A.J. Erskine, owner of a commercial oyster hatchery on the Potomac River in Virginia. “I don’t know if there is a solution, but the more data we have the more knowledge we have. If we don’t know the pH, how can we address it?”Erskine is part of a group of fishermen, scientists, and state fisheries managers called the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Acidification Network that is pushing for more research and attention on the issue. Scientists at the University of Delaware and NOAA just deployed the first permanent buoy to measure carbon dioxide levels in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the eastern United States. The moored buoy will help researchers figure out whether the bay can handle more CO2 from the atmosphere while also dealing with man-made pollution from surrounding farms and factories.In another attempt to study acidification, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched 23-foot long surface drones powered by sail across the Pacific and Arctic Oceans to gather wind, temperature, and acidity data. They hope to eventually use the mobile saildrones to replace aging surface buoys that are tethered to the seafloor.Grace Saba of Rutgers takes water samples to better understand the changing ocean.And just as some scientists are trying to develop corals that are more resistant to acidic waters, Erskine says that one solution may be to find oysters, clams, and other fish that are resilient as well.“The way we can do that is by manipulating the tanks in the hatchery,” Erskine said. Of course, that only works for farm- or hatchery-raised species. “It’s more difficult when you are talking about Chesapeake Bay or the Gulf of Maine.”Back on the boat, Saba, Wright-Fairbanks, and Rutgers research professor Travis Miles spend the morning at sea testing the Slocum glider. They want to make sure its instruments are working perfectly before putting it on auto-pilot and sending it on its environmental mission. Each in turn throws overboard a gray plastic water sampling bottle attached to a rope known as a CTD. Those old-school measurements of water quality are then compared to sensor readings on the glider.After the Rutgers team deploys the glider, the 46-foot crewboat returns to a marina near the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City. Wright-Fairbanks is just starting her PhD at Rutgers, and this ocean acidity experiment will comprise her thesis studies over the next few years.She recalls getting bit by the science bug as a high school student. During a science summer camp in the Bahamas, Wright-Fairbanks conducted an experiment in which fish were given the choice between swimming in a tank with acidic water or an adjacent one with a hungry shark.“Most chose the shark,” Wright-Fairbanks said.To these scientists, it’s clear that the world’s ocean is changing from both warming temperatures and rising acidity. Their work might help answer questions about which species will survive, which will migrate to other more-forgiving habitats, and which ones will end up a distant memory.",
"Atlantic mackerel, a fatty schooling fish, for years has been caught by fleets in parts of Europe and sold around the world—where it gets pickled, grilled, smoked, and fried. It is among the United Kingdom's key exports.But a decade ago, warming temperatures began driving this popular fish north, into seas controlled by Iceland. Almost overnight, this seafood gold began shredding relations between some of the world's most stable governments. It led to unsustainable fishing, trade embargoes, and boat blockades. It even helped convince Iceland to drop its bid to join the EU. And that was among friendly nations.Welcome to the climate-change food threat you may not have considered.In many parts of the world overfishing is already draining the ocean of important sea life. But a paper published today in the journal Science suggests potentially explosive ocean fish wars are likely to simmer across the world as warming temperatures drive commercial fish species poleward into territories controlled by other nations, setting up conflicts with sometimes hostile neighbors that are suddenly forced to share. That could lead to far fewer fish, economic declines and, in some areas, serious threats to food security."I've got a 3-year-old son, and sometimes it seems like he's better at sharing than countries are with fisheries," says lead author Malin Pinsky, an assistant professor of biology at Rutgers University in New Jersey.In parts of the world conflicts over ocean fishing are "already rampant. It's been brewing under the surface," says Jessica Spijkers, a sustainability researcher with the Stockholm Resilience Center and co-author of the study. "People have died at sea because fishing boats are out where other boat operators didn't think they should be."Warming waters threaten to make that worse, the authors say.Dozens of countries, thanks to climate change, can expect to see entirely new fisheries develop by mid-century, the new study suggests, with that number jumping to 70 or more nations by century's end. By then, many countries could draw nearly a third or more of their national catch from fish stocks that didn't exist in their waters just a few decades earlier.In parts of the world where governments are volatile and protein from the sea is essential, this is likely to set up conflicts that could escalate into violence or actual wars that threaten national sovereignty. In parts of East Asia, where international relations already are fraught because of disputed maritime boundaries and illegal fishing, scientists predict some countries could see 10 major new fisheries for species or stocks once exclusively managed by other countries."Even right now, it's likely to already be a bigger problem than we realize," Pinsky says. "I just don't think we're prepared for this globally."Most countries control fishing or have agreements to share rights within a 200-mile exclusive economic zone around their coasts. But fish, of course, don't care about political boundaries, and when they cross borders tempers can run hot.In the 1990s, after agreements to share West Coast fish collapsed, the United States and Canada faced a standoff over salmon. Canada accused Americans of overfishing and seized boats fishing in Canadian waters. The governor of Alaska accused its neighbor of resorting to "gunboat diplomacy." Canada, in turn, threatened to overfish its own rivers to keep American boats from nabbing the harvest. New England saw similar battles between the two countries over lobster.An elder of the Banjo tribe hunts for fish off the coast of Sampela, Indonesia.But now climate change has hundreds of species around the world moving toward the poles in search of colder waters, sometimes by hundreds of miles. And fishing rules and regulations simply cannot keep up.Longline catches of blueline tilefish, a lean and meaty species common in the southeast U.S., had been managed for years by federal regulators with rules that stretched only as far north as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. But a few years ago, officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service were alarmed to discover the tilefish were being caught in mass as far north as Long Island—where there were no rules at all, says Jonathan Hare, with the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. Eventually, the government set emergency rules.In 2016, the congressional delegation of several northeastern states complained to the Obama administration about an even odder situation. Black sea bass and summer flounder, once common in the southeast, had moved into the waters off Massachusetts, where local fishing boats could take but a scant few. Instead, quotas were still held by North Carolina fleets, which traveled to New England and caught 10 times more than local boats.Still, these battles are internal. Once fish leave international waters all bets are off.Consider how quickly Europe's "mackerel wars" spun out of control. In the early 2000s, mackerel fishing was driven by the EU, Norway, and the Faroe Islands. But in a few short years, Iceland—not an EU member—went from seeing almost no mackerel to netting more than 150,000 tons. So the EU tried to make a deal with Iceland to share catches of the fish, infuriating Norway.Angry and fearful over Iceland's fishing, the Faroe Islands withdrew from sustainable fishing agreements it made with Norway and the EU and started setting its own harvest limits. Scottish officials called the move "selfish"—one accused Iceland and Faroe Island fishing captains of acting like "their Viking ancestors." The EU responded with a trade embargo. Protesting fishermen surrounded one boat at a Scottish dock, refusing to let it offload. For awhile, North Sea mackerel fishing skyrocketed beyond what scientists considered sustainable."Even in the countries with the best of governments, those disputes are difficult to manage," Spijkers says. Many countries won't be so lucky.With illegal fishing already common in parts of the world, it's clear existing rules don't always do a good enough job of managing fish that haven't moved. Once they have, Pinsky points out, international laws don't have mechanisms to encourage countries to work together—or even to do research so they can agree on where the fish are going."Even when there are enough fish to go around, what we've seen is that when countries can't cooperate, that often leads to competitive fishing—to a race to catch the fish when they're there," Pinsky says. "With climate change, there's potential for a future where disputes around fishing lead to less fish, less profit, less employment, and more concern about food supplies."In many countries, one fish stock may move out while another moves in. Around the tropics, however—where millions of people rely on reef fish for their protein—scientists expect to see a loss of diversity and far fewer fish overall. How countries respond to that potentially desperate scenario is worrying to Pinsky."Conflicts that start out as being about fisheries may not necessarily stay that way," he says.",
"Prayer flags cross Changri Shar Glacier in Sagarmatha National Park in the Himalaya in Nepal. The region is rapidly warming and ice is melting, which can be dangerous.The Himalaya, the breathtaking consequence of the battle between two tectonic plates, is home to spectacular mountains and a family of glaciers whose waters sustain 1.65 billion people across the region. The thawing of these glaciers leaves behind a myriad of lakes, some of which can suddenly burst their banks and flood downstream.Plenty of these lakes can also be found in the Tibetan Plateau, an elevated region containing Tibet and parts of western China, and a team of researchers wanted to know if any of them posed a threat to those that live nearby. Their satellite-based assessment of 1,291 glacial lakes in the Tibetan Plateau and along the main Himalaya range found that 16 percent of them potentially threaten human settlements.All these lakes form naturally, and localized topographical, geological, and hydrological conditions determine which lakes can or will eventually overflow. Anthropogenic climate change, however, is becoming an increasingly antagonizing presence.“Temperatures are rising, we’re seeing these lakes growing, and the smaller ponds are starting to coalesce,” says Ulyana Horodyskyj, a visiting assistant professor of environmental science at Colorado College and National Geographic Explorer not involved in the work. “This problem is only going to get worse.”Glacial lakes form when glaciers thaw, their waters hemmed in by rocky barriers left over by ancient glaciers that once carved out the landscape. Ice dams can also form a barrier. If something causes the water level to suddenly rise, such as an avalanche of ice or rock, or those barriers break—via an earthquake, say, or prolonged weathering—you can get a glacial lake outburst flood, or GLOF.These have happened all around the world, and since 1935, around 40 GLOF disasters have taken place across the Tibetan Plateau. Wanting to know what the contemporary danger to human populations were in the area, researchers mixed satellite work with Open Street Map, an open-access, street-level cartography database, to find out.The size of lake, the size of watershed, the slope of the dam, and the potential for ice avalanches to hit those lakes were all taken into account, as were the number of buildings in the way of the worst-case scenario floods.As reported in the journal Science Bulletin this week, 210 glacial lakes in the region potentially threaten human settlements. Simon Allen, a glaciologist at the University of Zurich and lead author of the new study, says that he was surprised that the number of potentially hazardous lakes was so high, despite the region being sparsely populated.Cirenmaco came out as the most dangerous lake. It had already been the source of three major documented GLOF events in the recent past, including one in July 1981 that killed 200 people. Presented the research earlier this month at the annual gathering of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna, Allen told reporters that his team identified a hotspot of high danger on the Chinese-Nepalese border, demonstrating that a single flood can devastate communities in multiple countries at once.The researchers are already calling for the same remote sensing work to be carried out across much of the wider region, where many more hazardous lakes lie in wait.Sergiu Jiduc, an environmental geoscientist and research consultant for the World Energy Council, emphasizes that ground-based research will always play a vital role in identifying glacial lake hazards. This certainly applies when local communities are involved: their long histories of residing in and living with their surroundings may, among other things, capture environmental changes that might not be detected through remote sensing, says Jiduc, who is also a National Geographic Explorer.Horodyskyj, who has worked extensively in the region, agrees, while adding that an advantage of remote sensing is that it can catalogue lake hazards over a huge area far more quickly. “This kind of satellite-based approach is basically tailormade for some of the region’s conflict zones,” says Allen.It’s not just about identifying hazards. This research is designed to help prioritize where mitigation resources are sent. That matters, because danger reduction plans are at present somewhat limited.Joseph Shea, an assistant professor of environmental geomatics at the University of Northern British Columbia, explains that the Nepalese armed forces, among others, sometimes artificially drain lakes—“not an easy undertaking in the slightest,” he adds.Early warning systems, similar to those that aim to warn populations of volcanic mudslides, can help too, explains Shea, but false alarms and making sure they can run continuously can prove challenging. At the same time, GLOFs can happen so quickly that people might not have much time to get out of harm’s way. You could even set up cheap webcams and add water gauges to the lakes to keep an eye on things, says Horodyskyj, so long as the valleys have a decent WiFi network.Jiduc, who was also recently funded by the National Geographic Society to head to Pakistan’s Karakoram mountain range to help communities adapt to GLOFs, explains that even if places have an autonomous, effective early warning system in place, it doesn’t solve the problem.“It’s just buying some time,” he says.A recent comprehensive report on the Hindu Kush Himalaya region found that our rapidly warming world is decimating its glaciers. “Irrespective of whether we manage to curb greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement, we will lose a third of these glaciers,” says Jiduc. “If not, we could lose up to two-thirds of them.”Sudeep Thakuri, an associate professor and glaciologist at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, says that thanks to this general pattern of glacial shrinkage, glacial lakes are growing rapidly in number and size. Accumulating evidence suggests the potential threats these lakes pose is increasing too.The calculus is relatively straightforward. Larger lakes lead to larger GLOFs, Allen explains, and the increasing population of lakes higher upslope means that ice avalanches can hit them more easily. As time goes on, GLOFs should increase in frequency and magnitude.Adam Emmer, an environmental scientist at the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, says that researchers are still trying to pin down the change in GLOF daner over time. It’s fair to say, though, that “the formation and evolution of lakes, as well as some of the GLOF causes, are tied with climate change-driven glacier retreat.”The clock, therefore, is ticking. If disasters are to be averted, everyone—from policymakers and researchers to charities and communities—has to work closely together. “Transboundary issues require transboundary partnerships,” says Jiduc.",
"The snowy peaks of the Himalaya—seen from 27,000 feet on Mount Everest's northern face—are part of a vital freshwater cache that courses down to a vast populace. But warming temperatures and fast-melting ice could cause disaster downstream.The gods must be furious.It's the only explanation that makes sense to Jia Son, a Tibetan farmer surveying the catastrophe unfolding above his village in China's mountainous Yunnan Province. "We've upset the natural order," the devout, 52-year-old Buddhist says. "And now the gods are punishing us."On a warm summer afternoon, Jia Son has hiked a mile and a half up the gorge that Ming­yong Glacier has carved into sacred Mount Kawagebo, looming 22,113 feet high in the clouds above. There's no sign of ice, just a river roiling with silt-laden melt. For more than a century, ever since its tongue lapped at the edge of Mingyong village, the glacier has retreated like a dying serpent recoiling into its lair. Its pace has accelerated over the past decade, to more than a football field every year—a distinctly unglacial rate for an ancient ice mass."This all used to be ice ten years ago," Jia Son says, as he scrambles across the scree and brush. He points out a yak trail etched into the slope some 200 feet above the valley bottom. "The glacier sometimes used to cover that trail, so we had to lead our animals over the ice to get to the upper meadows."Around a bend in the river, the glacier's snout finally comes into view: It's a deathly shade of black, permeated with pulverized rock and dirt. The water from this ice, once so pure it served in rituals as a symbol of Buddha himself, is now too loaded with sediment for the villagers to drink. For nearly a mile the glacier's once smooth surface is ragged and cratered like the skin of a leper. There are glimpses of blue-green ice within the fissures, but the cracks themselves signal trouble. "The beast is sick and wasting away," Jia Son says. "If our sacred glacier cannot survive, how can we?"It is a question that echoes around the globe, but nowhere more urgently than across the vast swath of Asia that draws its water from the "roof of the world." This geologic colossus—the highest and largest plateau on the planet, ringed by its tallest mountains—covers an area greater than western Europe, at an average altitude of more than two miles. With nearly 37,000 glaciers on the Chinese side alone, the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding arc of mountains contain the largest volume of ice outside the polar regions. This ice gives birth to Asia's largest and most legendary rivers, from the Yangtze and the Yellow to the Mekong and the Ganges—rivers that over the course of history have nurtured civilizations, inspired religions, and sustained ecosystems. Today they are lifelines for some of Asia's most densely settled areas, from the arid plains of Pakistan to the thirsty metropolises of northern China 3,000 miles away. All told, some two billion people in more than a dozen countries—nearly a third of the world's population—depend on rivers fed by the snow and ice of the plateau region.But a crisis is brewing on the roof of the world, and it rests on a curious paradox: For all its seeming might and immutability, this geologic expanse is more vulnerable to climate change than almost anywhere else on Earth. The Tibetan Plateau as a whole is heating up twice as fast as the global average of 1.3°F over the past century—and in some places even faster. These warming rates, unprecedented for at least two millennia, are merciless on the glaciers, whose rare confluence of high altitudes and low latitudes make them especially sensitive to shifts in climate.For thousands of years the glaciers have formed what Lonnie Thompson, a glaciologist at Ohio State University, calls "Asia's freshwater bank account"—an immense storehouse whose buildup of new ice and snow (deposits) has historically offset its annual runoff (withdrawals). Glacial melt plays its most vital role before and after the rainy season, when it supplies a greater portion of the flow in every river from the Yangtze (which irrigates more than half of China's rice) to the Ganges and the Indus (key to the agricultural heartlands of India and Pakistan).But over the past half century, the balance has been lost, perhaps irrevocably. Of the 680 glaciers Chinese scientists monitor closely on the Tibetan Plateau, 95 percent are shedding more ice than they're adding, with the heaviest losses on its southern and eastern edges. "These glaciers are not simply retreating," Thompson says. "They're losing mass from the surface down." The ice cover in this portion of the plateau has shrunk more than 6 percent since the 1970s—and the damage is still greater in Tajikistan and northern India, with 35 percent and 20 percent declines respectively over the past five decades.The rate of melting is not uniform, and a number of glaciers in the Karakoram Range on the western edge of the plateau are actually advancing. This anomaly may result from increases in snowfall in the higher latitude—and therefore colder—Karakorams, where snow and ice are less vulnerable to small temperature increases. The gaps in scientific knowledge are still great, and in the Tibetan Plateau they are deepened by the region's remoteness and political sensitivity—as well as by the inherent complexities of climate science.Though scientists argue about the rate and cause of glacial retreat, most don't deny that it's happening. And they believe the worst may be yet to come. The more dark areas that are exposed by melting, the more sunlight is absorbed than reflected, causing temperatures to rise faster. (Some climatologists believe this warming feedback loop could intensify the Asian monsoon, triggering more violent storms and flooding in places such as Bangladesh and Myanmar.) If current trends hold, Chinese scientists believe that 40 percent of the plateau's glaciers could disappear by 2050. "Full-scale glacier shrinkage is inevitable," says Yao Tandong, a glaciologist at China's Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research. "And it will lead to ecological catastrophe."The potential impacts extend far beyond the glaciers. On the Tibetan Plateau, especially its dry northern flank, people are already affected by a warmer climate. The grasslands and wetlands are deteriorating, and the permafrost that feeds them with spring and summer melt is retreating to higher elevations. Thousands of lakes have dried up. Desert now covers about one-sixth of the plateau, and in places sand dunes lap across the highlands like waves in a yellow sea. The herders who once thrived here are running out of options.Along the plateau's southern edge, by contrast, many communities are coping with too much water. In alpine villages like Mingyong, the glacial melt has swelled rivers, with welcome side effects: expanded croplands and longer growing seasons. But such benefits often hide deeper costs. In Mingyong, surging meltwater has carried away topsoil; elsewhere, excess runoff has been blamed for more frequent flooding and landslides. In the mountains from Pakistan to Bhutan, thousands of glacial lakes have formed, many potentially unstable. Among the more dangerous is Imja Tsho, at 16,400 feet on the trail to Nepal's Island Peak. Fifty years ago the lake didn't exist; today, swollen by melt, it is a mile long and 300 feet deep. If it ever burst through its loose wall of moraine, it would drown the Sherpa villages in the valley below.This situation—too much water, too little water—captures, in miniature, the trajectory of the overall crisis. Even if melting glaciers provide an abundance of water in the short run, they portend a frightening endgame: the eventual depletion of Asia's greatest rivers. Nobody can predict exactly when the glacier retreat will translate into a sharp drop in runoff. Whether it happens in 10, 30, or 50 years depends on local conditions, but the collateral damage across the region could be devastating. Along with acute water and electricity shortages, experts predict a plunge in food production, widespread migration in the face of ecological changes, even conflicts between Asian powers.The nomads' tent is a pinprick of white against a canvas of green and brown. There is no other sign of human existence on the 14,000-foot-high prairie that seems to extend to the end of the world. As a vehicle rattles toward the tent, two young men emerge, their long black hair horizontal in the wind. Ba O and his brother Tsering are part of an unbroken line of Tibetan nomads who for at least a thousand years have led their herds to summer grazing grounds near the headwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.Inside the tent, Ba O's wife tosses patties of dried yak dung onto the fire while her four-year-old son plays with a spool of sheep's wool. The family matriarch, Lu Ji, churns yak milk into cheese, rocking back and forth in a hypnotic rhythm. Behind her are two weathered Tibetan chests topped with a small Buddhist shrine: a red prayer wheel, a couple of smudged Tibetan texts, and several yak butter candles whose flames are never allowed to go out. "This is the way we've always done things," Ba O says. "And we don't want that to change."But it may be too late. The grasslands are dying out, as decades of warming temperatures—exacerbated by overgrazing—turn prairie into desert. Watering holes are drying up, and now, instead of traveling a short distance to find summer grazing for their herds, Ba O and his family must trek more than 30 miles across the high plateau. Even there the grass is meager. "It used to grow so high you could lose a sheep in it," Ba O says. "Now it doesn't reach above their hooves." The family's herd has dwindled from 500 animals to 120. The next step seems inevitable: selling their remaining livestock and moving into a government resettlement camp.Across Asia the response to climate-induced threats has mostly been slow and piecemeal, as if governments would prefer to leave it up to the industrialized countries that pumped the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in the first place. There are exceptions. In Ladakh, a bone-dry region in northern India and Pakistan that relies entirely on melting ice and snow, a retired civil engineer named Chewang Norphel has built "artificial glaciers"—simple stone embankments that trap and freeze glacial melt in the fall for use in the early spring growing season. Nepal is developing a remote monitoring system to gauge when glacial lakes are in danger of bursting, as well as the technology to drain them. Even in places facing destructive monsoonal flooding, such as Bangladesh, "floating schools" in the delta enable kids to continue their education—on boats.But nothing compares to the campaign in China, which has less water than Canada but 40 times more people. In the vast desert in the Xin­jiang region, just north of the Tibetan Plateau, China aims to build 59 reservoirs to capture and save glacial runoff. Across Tibet, artillery batteries have been installed to launch rain-inducing silver iodide into the clouds. In Qinghai the government is blocking off degraded grasslands in hopes they can be nurtured back to health. In areas where grasslands have already turned to scrub desert, bales of wire fencing are rolled out over the last remnants of plant life to prevent them from blowing away.Along the road near the town of Madoi are two rows of newly built houses. This is a resettlement village for Tibetan nomads, part of a massive and controversial program to relieve pressure on the grasslands near the sources of China's three major rivers—the Yangtze, Yellow, and Mekong—where nearly half of Qinghai Province's 530,000 nomads have traditionally lived. Tens of thousands of nomads here have had to give up their way of life, and many more—including, perhaps, Ba O—may follow.The subsidized housing is solid, and residents receive a small annual stipend. Even so, Jixi Lamu, a 33-year-old woman in a traditional embroidered dress, says her family is stuck in limbo, dependent on government handouts. "We've spent the $400 we had left from selling off our animals," she says. "There was no future with our herds, but there's no future here either." Her husband is away looking for menial work. Inside the one-room house, her mother sits on the bed, fingering her prayer beads. A Buddhist shrine stands on the other side of the room, but the candles have burned out.It is not yet noon in Delhi, just 180 miles south of the Himalayan glaciers. But in the narrow corridors of Nehru Camp, a slum in this city of 16 million, the blast furnace of the north Indian summer has already sent temperatures soaring past 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Chaya, the 25-year-old wife of a fortune-teller, has spent seven hours joining the mad scramble for water that, even today, defines life in this heaving metropolis—and offers a taste of what the depletion of Tibet's water and ice portends.Chaya's day began long before sunrise, when she and her five children fanned out in the darkness, armed with plastic jugs of every size. After daybreak, the rumor of a tap with running water sent her stumbling in a panic through the slum's narrow corridors. Now, with her containers still empty and the sun blazing overhead, she has returned home for a moment's rest. Asked if she's eaten anything today, she laughs: "We haven't even had any tea yet."Suddenly cries erupt—a water truck has been spotted. Chaya leaps up and joins the human torrent in the street. A dozen boys swarm onto a blue tanker, jamming hoses in and siphoning the water out. Below, shouting women jostle for position with their containers. In six minutes the tanker is empty. Chaya arrived too late and must move on to chase the next rumor of water.Delhi's water demand already exceeds supply by more than 300 million gallons a day, a shortfall worsened by inequitable distribution and a leaky infrastructure that loses an estimated 40 percent of the water. More than two-thirds of the city's water is pulled from the Yamuna and the Ganges, rivers fed by Himalayan ice. If that ice disappears, the future will almost certainly be worse. "We are facing an unsustainable situation," says Diwan Singh, a Delhi environmental activist. "Soon—not in thirty years but in five to ten—there will be an exodus because of the lack of water."The tension already seethes. In the clogged alleyway around one of Nehru Camp's last functioning taps, which run for one hour a day, a man punches a woman who cut in line, leaving a purple welt on her face. "We wake up every morning fighting over water," says Kamal Bhate, a local astrologer watching the melee. This one dissolves into shouting and finger-pointing, but the brawls can be deadly. In a nearby slum a teenage boy was recently beaten to death for cutting in line.As the rivers dwindle, the conflicts could spread. India, China, and Pakistan all face pressure to boost food production to keep up with their huge and growing populations. But climate change and diminishing water supplies could reduce cereal yields in South Asia by 5 percent within three decades. "We're going to see rising tensions over shared water resources, including political disputes between farmers, between farmers and cities, and between human and ecological demands for water," says Peter Gleick, a water expert and president of the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California. "And I believe more of these tensions will lead to violence."The real challenge will be to prevent water conflicts from spilling across borders. There is already a growing sense of alarm in Central Asia over the prospect that poor but glacier-heavy nations (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan) may one day restrict the flow of water to their parched but oil-rich neighbors (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan). In the future, peace between Pakistan and India may hinge as much on water as on nuclear weapons, for the two countries must share the glacier-dependent Indus.The biggest question mark hangs over China, which controls the sources of the region's major rivers. Its damming of the Mekong has sparked anger downstream in Indochina. If Beijing follows through on tentative plans to divert the Brahmaputra, it could provoke its rival, India, in the very region where the two countries fought a war in 1962.For the people in Nehru Camp, geopolitical concerns are lost in the frenzied pursuit of water. In the afternoon, a tap outside the slum is suddenly turned on, and Chaya, smiling triumphantly, hauls back a full, ten-gallon jug on top of her head. The water is dirty and bitter, and there are no means to boil it. But now, at last, she can give her children their first meal of the day: a piece of bread and a few spoonfuls of lentil stew. "They should be studying, but we keep shooing them away to find water," Chaya says. "We have no choice, because who knows if we'll find enough water tomorrow."Fatalism may be a natural response to forces that seem beyond our control. But Jia Son, the Tibetan farmer watching Mingyong Glacier shrink, believes that every action counts—good or bad, large or small. Pausing on the mountain trail, he makes a guilty confession. The melting ice, he says, may be his fault.When Jia Son first noticed the rising temperatures—an unfamiliar trickle of sweat down his back about a decade ago—he figured it was a gift from the gods. Winter soon lost some of its brutal sting. The glacier began releasing its water earlier in the summer, and for the first time in memory villagers had the luxury of two harvests a year.Then came the Chinese tourists, a flood of city dwellers willing to pay locals to take them up to see the glacier. The Han tourists don't always respect Buddhist traditions; in their gleeful hollers to provoke an icefall, they seem unaware of the calamity that has befallen the glacier. Still, they have turned a poor village into one of the region's wealthiest. "Life is much easier now," says Jia Son, whose simple farmhouse, like all in the village, has a television and government-subsidized satellite dish. "But maybe our greed has made Kawagebo angry."He is referring to the temperamental deity above his village. One of the holiest mountains in Tibetan Buddhism, Kawagebo has never been conquered, and locals believe its summit—and its glacier—should remain untouched. When a Sino-Japanese expedition tried to scale the peak in 1991, an avalanche near the top of the glacier killed all 17 climbers. Jia Son remains convinced the deaths were not an accident but an act of divine retribution. Could Mingyong's retreat be another sign of Kawagebo's displeasure?Jia Son is taking no chances.

"From left, Pandit Jawarharlal Nehru, vice president of India's interim government; Earl Mountbatten, viceroy of India; and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, president of the Muslim League, discuss Britain's plan for the future of its colony at the historic India Conference in New Delhi, June 2, 1947.Since 1947, India and Pakistan have been locked in conflict over Kashmir, a majority-Muslim region in the northernmost part of India. The mountainous, 86,000-square-mile territory was once a princely state. Now, it is claimed by both India and Pakistan.The roots of the conflict lie in the countries’ shared colonial past. From the 17th to the 20th century, Britain ruled most of the Indian subcontinent, first indirectly through the British East India Company, then from 1858 directly through the British crown. Over time, Britain’s power over its colony weakened, and a growing nationalist movement threatened the crown’s slipping rule.Though it feared civil war between India’s Hindu majority and Muslim minority, Britain faced increasing pressure to grant independence to its colony. After World War II, Parliament decided British rule in India should end by 1948.Britain had historically had separate electorates for Muslim citizens and reserved some political seats specifically for Muslims; that not only hemmed Muslims into a minority status, but fueled a growing Muslim separatist movement. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a politician who headed up India’s Muslim League, began demanding a separate nation for India’s Muslim population.“It is high time that the British Government applied their mind definitely to the division of India and the establishment of Pakistan and Hindustan, which means freedom for both,” Jinnah said in 1945.As religious riots broke out across British India, leaving tens of thousands dead, British and Indian leaders began to seriously consider a partition of the subcontinent based on religion. On August 14, 1947, the independent, Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan was formed. The Hindu-majority independent nation of India followed the next day.Under the hasty terms of partition, more than 550 princely states within colonial India that were not directly governed by Britain could decide to join either new nation or remain independent.The maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh, in June 1946.At the time, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which had a majority Muslim population, was governed by maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu. Unlike most of the princely states which aligned themselves with one nation or the other, Singh wanted independence for Kashmir. To avert pressure to join either new nation, the maharaja signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan that allowed citizens of Kashmir to continue trade and travel with the new country. India did not sign a similar standstill agreement with the princely state.As partition-related violence raged across the two new nations, the government of Pakistan pressured Kashmir to join it. Pro-Pakistani rebels, funded by Pakistan, took over much of western Kashmir, and in September 1947, Pashtun tribesmen streamed over the border from Pakistan into Kashmir. Singh asked for India’s help in staving off the invasion, but India responded that, in order to gain military assistance, Kashmir would have to accede to India, thus becoming part of the new country.Singh agreed and signed the Instrument of Accession, the document that aligned Kashmir with the Dominion of India, in October 1947. Kashmir was later given special status within the Indian constitution—a status which guaranteed that Kashmir would have independence over everything but communications, foreign affairs, and defense. This special status was revoked by the Indian government in August 2019.The maharaja's fateful decision to align Kashmir with India ushered in decades of conflict in the contested region, including two wars and a longstanding insurgency.",
"Snow and ice decorate the flanks of Mount Rainier, a volcano in Washington State.Supervolcanoes sound terrifying, but the risks they pose don’t usually match their fearsome reputations. Yellowstone in particular often makes its way into headlines, as every earthquake swarm or change in geyser activity spawns unfounded rumors of an apocalyptic eruption.However, ask a volcanologist where the real risk in the U.S. lurks, and there’s a good chance that they will turn their gaze to the Pacific Northwest.Nestled among the Cascade mountain range sits Mount Rainier, a postcard-perfect natural wonder—and a volcano that causes scientists genuine concern. It’s unclear when it will stir from its long slumber, and there’s no sign that anything is imminent. Nevertheless, a future eruption could cause one of the worst natural disasters in the U.S. (See pictures of the 10 most dangerous volcanoes in the U.S.)Unlike its infamous cousin, Mount St. Helens, Rainier is not known to be particularly explosive. And yet, Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University, is unequivocal in her assessment.“Rainier is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world,” she says. “It’s a huge concern.”To make the case, Krippner points to Colombia’s Nevado del Ruiz volcano, which experienced a notorious eruption in November 1985. In that event, neither lava nor pyroclastic flows of hot gas and ash were the killer elements. Instead, the paroxysm quickly melted the volcano’s summit glaciers, and fresh floodwaters rapidly entrained and mobilized the loose sediment on the volcano’s flanks.This activity set off a series of lahars: viscous, violent slurries that rushed down toward the town of Armero at about 30 miles an hour as its residents slept. The town and its inhabitants were smothered within mere moments. The eruption is now known as one of the worst volcanic disasters in human history, killing around 23,000 people.This volcanic hazard is the reason a future eruption at Rainier could prove to be so deadly. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has carefully mapped and studied the sleeping colossus, and it’s clear that the valleys on its slopes are perfect for lahar formation, with several suburbs of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolis sitting right in the path of disaster.“Lahars can lift houses. They can overtake a bridge. They can take the bridge with it,” Krippner says. In the past, lahars from eruptions filled up valleys to heights of almost 500 feet along Rainier’s viridian flanks.“Imagine if you’re in that valley today,” Krippner says. “Can you climb 150 meters [490 feet] particularly quickly?”“I do think it is one of the most hazardous volcanoes in North America,” says Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist and outreach coordinator at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory, and one of the world’s foremost experts on Rainier. In addition to the profound economic damage an eruption would cause to the region’s settlements and ports, she cites the large number of people who live in valleys that were inundated by past lahars.At least 80,000 people sit in zones that future lahars are certainly capable of reaching. If residents aren’t prepared, an eruption at Rainier could prove to be America’s very own Armero tragedy.An aerial view shows the Seattle harbor with Mount Rainier in the background.But are people prepared? The USGS has a comprehensive plan to communicate hazards and aid authorities, but it’s not yet enough. As Driedger points out, “people don’t associate mud with volcanoes.” This makes conveying the hazards of Rainier incredibly challenging, especially since many people erroneously see the volcano exuding a permanent state of calm.In recent years, the amount of people moving to the Pacific Northwest has risen significantly, and millions of Americans visit Mount Rainier National Park every year. Both groups, in general, have no experience with or knowledge of volcanic eruptions.Gates of the Arctic is one of several national parks in remote, roadless areas of Alaska. This northernmost national park in the U.S. is visited by only a few thousand people a year, making for great wildlife viewing.“When talking about Mount Rainier’s hazards, it often feels like we’re starting from scratch,” Driedger says.Even though Rainier is one of the most heavily monitored volcanoes on the planet, it remains an idiosyncratic monolith. The volcano last shook in 1894-95, when minor explosions reportedly rocked the summit, but it hasn’t really blown its top for at least a thousand years or so.The next eruption or lahar could occur with little to no advanced warning, and it’s not clear if it’s possible to evacuate so many thousands of people in a matter of minutes. Even if they are fortunate enough to get a warning, people might not heed it. (Also find out why Yellowstone’s supervolcano could rumble to life faster—but not sooner—than thought.)“There’s this massive misconception that in a disaster, people panic,” Krippner says. “Recent research shows that that’s a rare case. Most often, people don’t react; they freeze, or they shrug the warning off, assuming it’s not that serious.”It’s also not possible to say exactly how the next Rainier eruption will manifest itself.“When talking to community groups, I emphasize we could have nothing more than a small steam-based eruption at the summit, or it could be something much larger,” Driedger says. History nevertheless underscores that you only need a moderate blast to melt a large amount of snow and ice, triggering a lahar.Humanity isn’t exactly defenseless against Rainier’s wrath. Three of the four larger river valleys branching down from the volcano have dams, and as other volcano-prone countries such as Japan and Indonesia have demonstrated, those dams could drain their reservoirs and be used to trap incoming lahars—as long as they are constantly maintained.The Puyallup Valley, however, remains undammed, and creating one in this increasingly populated region any time soon seems unlikely. That, and the presence of weak and easily entrained rock in the valley, makes it the highest risk zone.A recent study Driedger coauthored explores the multiple ways to mitigate the risks of lahars. Of special note, however, is her team’s emphasis on one particular notion: Such efforts will mean little if volcanologists don’t work closely with local communities and authorities to communicate the nature of the hazards properly.“Twenty-three thousand lives could have been saved at Nevado Del Ruiz,” Krippner says. “Now, we have the chance to do that here.”Robin George Andrews is a volcanologist turned science journalist based in London.

"Pine Island Glacier, in West Antarctica, is retreating quickly. In 2014, this iceberg, 20 miles wide, broke off the tongue of the glacier and floated away. Other chunks of ice continue to shear off the glacier.The towering glaciers of West Antarctica hold the fate of the world’s coasts in their flanks. Their collapse could send sea levels up by at least a foot by 2100—and potentially much more.For years, scientists have watched and learned that those glaciers are crumbling and melting, the rate speeding up over the decades and imperiling the stability of the entire ice sheet. But while the science was clear that human influences on climate would affect the ice down the line, it has been hard to tell whether human-driven global warming has affected the melting already underway.Now, a team has unraveled evidence of that human influence. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a team of scientists showed that over the past century, human-driven global warming has changed the character of the winds that blow over the ocean near some of the most fragile glaciers in West Antarctica. Sometimes, those winds have weakened or reversed, which in turn causes changes in the ocean water that laps up against the ice in a way that caused the glaciers to melt.“We now have evidence to support that human activities have influenced the sea level rise we’ve seen from West Antarctica,” says lead author Paul Holland, a polar scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.The massive West Antarctic ice sheet holds something like 6 percent of the world’s fresh water frozen in its guts. If it all melted away, global sea levels would rise by about 10 feet or more. That’s not likely to happen anytime particularly soon, scientists think, but some parts of the ice sheet are particularly vulnerable, in danger of crossing a crucial “tipping point” if they retreat too far. (Read about the "tipping point" here).In the past decades, some glaciers in the region have been retreating shockingly quickly. Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glaciers, for example, are losing about 100 billion tons of ice each year, and more in bad years. (See what a 10 billion ton chunk of ice looks like in this video).The glaciers have been receding because their snouts spill over the edge of the continent into the surrounding ocean, which is warmer than the ice. The warm water melts away the ice.Just how warm the ocean is, though, matters a lot. Over decades, the temperature of the water has waxed and waned, driven in part by natural climate cycles that send different water masses close to the edge of the ice sheet at different times, cycling through from cold to a little less cold every five years or so.The main thing that controls whether warm water makes it to the edge of the ice sheet, it turns out, is the strength of the winds a little bit farther offshore, in the heart of the icy, bitter Amundsen Sea. Sometimes, those winds—cousins of the famous raging band of Southern Ocean winds known as the Roaring 40s—slacken or even reverse. When they do, more warm water ends up near the edge of the ice sheet, which means more ice melts away. (See what the world would look like if all the ice melted away).“In the 1920s, the winds were pretty much consistently blowing toward the west,” says Holland. “So in the old days, it was cold all the time—it flopped between cold and very cold.”But now, because of the slow warming of the planet, the whole baseline has moved up. Instead of the cycle flipping between cold and very cold, the flip is between warm and cold.Scientists knew that the strength of the winds in this region of the Amundsen Sea affected the water temperature. Records of wind strength and direction only went back until 1979. But the patterns in this region match up nearly perfectly with conditions far away, in the tropical Pacific Ocean, where much better, longer-term records exist—so the team could extrapolate how the polar-region winds have changed over the last century.They used a suite of climate models to look at how the wind patterns would have evolved over the last 100 years if human-caused global warming weren’t in play, and compared that with what the winds actually did. Today’s pattern—with about equal west-flowing and east-flowing winds—means the whole region ends up quite a bit warmer than it was 100 years ago, when the wind flowed toward the west most of the time.In the past, and even up to the early part of the record the scientists looked at in the 1920s, ice melted during warm phases and grew back during cold phases. But over the last century, that balance has come undone. The shifting winds and warm ocean phases have eaten away at the ice more quickly than it’s being replaced.Several particularly notable moments of wind-flipping, like in the 1970s, matched up closely with major retreats of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers.Those glaciers are particularly sensitive to melting at their snouts. The ground underneath them, it turns out, is concave, like a bowl. The glacier ice is attached the “rim” of the bowl, but if it melts back past that edge, warm ocean water can spill underneath it and melt it even more quickly from the bottom.In 1974, one of these strong moments of melting pushed the glaciers past one of these “rims,” and since then the glacier has melted much more quickly than it did before—at least 50 percent more melt after that un-groundig than before, said Eric Steig, an atmospheic and ice core scientist at the University of Washington and an author of the paper.The ultimate cause of the wind patterns, they found, is human-caused climate change. The extra greenhouse gases humans have pumped into the atmosphere over the past few hundred years have changed the way heat moves around the planet so thoroughly that they’ve changed the shape of the basic wind patterns at the poles.The Antarctic ice sheet sat more or less stable in shape and size for many thousands of years. But about a century ago, pieces of it started to retreat in measurable ways. That’s well within the time frame when carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases had started to accumulate thickly in the atmosphere, so it seemed logical to think that human influence was affecting the ice. But Antarctica is a complicated place that changes a lot because of natural variability, so it has been challenging to pinpoint the extent of human influence on the changes.“It was very hard to imagine that the ice sat around happily for millennia and then decided to retreat naturally just as humans started perturbing the system, but the evidence for forcing by natural variability was strong,” writes Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, in an email.But a warming planet has very clearly changed the way winds move around Antarctica—and that change is likely to continue, unless something drastic happens to slow or reverse the warming process.“If we carry this pattern forward, we may move to a situation where we’re flipping between warm and very warm,” says Holland. And that could be devastating for the ice.But the future isn’t yet written, Steig stressed. Keeping future greenhouse gas emissions in check would go a long way toward keeping those crucial winds from weakening further, the water under the edge of the ice chilly, and the ice frozen.“[West Antarctic Ice Sheet] melting will affect everyone,” says Steig. “The effects will be global, because sea level will rise globally.”",
"How fast sea level rises in the next century will depend a lot on how fast the West Antarctic ice sheet crumbles.Scientists have discovered that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet underwent a major retreat between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, at a time when the world was actually cooler than it is today. The collapse happened at the close of the last Ice Age, and it left the ice sheet 135,000 square miles smaller than it is today – a difference nearly as large as the state of Montana.“That the ice sheet could retreat beyond where it is today, in a climate that was likely quite a bit colder than today, points to extraordinary sensitivity,” says Robert DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved in the research.Most researchers had believed that the West Antarctic ice sheet hadn’t been much smaller than it is now for at least 120,000 years. “We were really surprised,” says Reed Scherer, of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, who co-authored the new paper, published today in the journal Nature, with nine other scientists.West Antarctica is considered the most vulnerable of Earth’s three major ice sheets. It rests in a deep, broad bowl that dips thousands of feet below sea level – exposing it to warm ocean currents. It would raise sea level by 11 feet if it collapsed.(Read more here about the threat from melting Antarctic ice.)Scientists hope that by reconstructing the past advances and retreats of the West Antarctic ice sheet, they can predict its future fate amid global warming.Another paper published in the same issue of Nature confirmed the urgency: It found that Antarctica as whole lost more than 3 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2017. Most of that came from West Antarctica, where the rate of ice loss has tripled in the last quarter century.In 2013 scientists drilled through the West Antarctic ice sheet into a subglacial lake—and found evidence that the ice sheet had once been much smaller.The new evidence of West Antarctic fragility stems from two research expeditions that visited the region in the last several years. Scherer was part of the first one. It began in January 2013, as a convoy of tractors, towing a million pounds of equipment on massive sleds, arrived at a remote spot on the ice sheet, just 380 miles from the South Pole. The place seemed unremarkable – nothing but flat, wind-sculpted snow in every direction.The expedition’s true objective lay half a mile beneath the surface: a body of water, called Lake Whillans, sealed under the ice sheet. The lake’s outline had been mapped with ice-penetrating radar. No human had ever laid eyes on it. But that January, the equipment on those sleds was assembled into a monstrous drill that, with a jet of hot water, melted a hole, 20 inches wide and 2,600 feet deep – straight through the ice, and into the lake.Scherer and his colleagues plunged a hollow cylinder into the bottom of the lake, and hoisted up 18 inches of mud – gritty stuff, full of the fragments of Antarctic bedrock, pulverized by sliding ice. When Scherer viewed that mud through a microscope, he found it littered with delicate shards of curved, dimpled glass: the ancient shells of diatoms, tiny marine creatures that had lived in this place at a time when it was covered not by ice, but by ocean – perhaps with a bit of ice floating on top.Carbon-dating of the mud showed that some of those diatoms had been deposited in what is now Lake Whillans as recently as 10,000 years ago—which was startling enough. But Scherer and his colleagues tested mud from nine other holes inland from Lake Whillans, as far as 120 miles from the present ice edge. They found young material in every single one. “That was the real shocker,” says Scherer.It suggested that the West Antarctic ice sheet had pulled back at least 120 miles. But even that is “just a lower limit,” says glaciologist Slawek Tulaczyk of the University of California at Santa Cruz, who co-led the drilling expedition.Since glaciers constantly drag along the mud at their base as they flow toward the coastline, he explains, the young mud in the boreholes could have come from as far as 300 to 400 miles inland—meaning that 10,000 years ago the edge of the ice sheet may have been as far inland as that.Even as Scherer, Tulaczyk and their colleagues grappled with these surprises, another scientist, unbeknownst to them, was making his own discovery.Jonathan Kingslake, a young glaciologist now at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York, spent two months in late 2014 camping on the opposite side of West Antarctica, 800 miles from Lake Whillans. Driving snowmobiles roped together in a single line—lest one of them plunge into a crevasse—he and his guide towed a sled carrying an ice-penetrating radar. As they traveled, sometimes 15 hours a day, the radar traced internal layers and cracks hidden thousands of feet down in the ice.In his tent one night, reviewing the day’s data on his laptop, Kingslake saw something intriguing. The radar’s black and white traces showed a series of bright lines rising from the bottom of the ice.Those lines, he ultimately decided, were the scars of old cracks that had opened, long ago, at the bottom of the ice sheet—at a time when it wasn’t thick and sitting on bedrock, as it is now at that place, but thinner and floating on the ocean. The cracks had formed as the ice skidded and juddered over a subglacial mountain. Then they had filled with seawater and refrozen.On the far side of West Antarctica from where Scherer and Tulaczyk worked, Kingslake had found independent evidence that the ice sheet had once retreated far inland. Reviewing all the evidence, Torsten Albrecht of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany estimated that the retreat happened 10 to 12 thousand years ago. Compared with the present, Albrecht calculates, West Antarctica contributed roughly 30,000 cubic miles of ice to sea level rise— equal to 130 trillion tons.At that time, the ice sheet was already in the midst of shrinking from its Ice Age maximum, when it extended 600 miles further out to sea than it does today. And the ocean floor sat at least 1,300 feet lower than it does today—because the weight of the massive ice sheet had pressed down on the Earth’s crust.As the ice retreated, thinned, and floated, this allowed warm ocean currents to slither in along the deep ocean floor. That melted the ice ever more rapidly, sending the ice sheet into full-blown collapse. It roared right past its present-day boundaries, retreating at least 120 miles further inland than today.This runaway collapse was eventually halted by slow changes in the Earth’s crust. The removal of all that ice allowed the crust to rebound upward. Researchers calculate that the seafloor under the ice sheet rose as quickly as 7 inches per year, or more than 1,300 feet over the course of several thousand years. This sheltered the remaining ice from the deep ocean currents that were melting it, allowing it to stabilize, re-advance, and eventually reach its present-day size—perhaps as little as 2,000 years ago.As the planet warms today, will this sort of glacial rebound protect us from a wholesale collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and the catastrophic sea-level rise that would result? Since temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are already far higher than they were 10,000 years ago, and still rising, Tulaczyk warns, the glacial retreat and rebound observed back then can’t simply be extrapolated to the future.But in any case, glacial rebound is too slow a process to be a comfort to humans. It would not rescue coastal cities from sea level rise, Tulaczyk says, “unless we are willing to hold our breath for thousands of years underwater.”",
"A chunk of ice the size of lower Manhattan—four miles wide, a mile across, and half a mile thick—broke off of the Helheim Glacier in Greenland and tumbled into the sea a few weeks ago.When ice that was previously sitting on land, like this piece of the glacier, falls into the ocean and melts, the ocean gets a little fuller. In other words, sea levels rise. (See what the world would look like if all the ice melted.)  This particular chunk of glacier—about 10 billion tons of ice, enough to give every American more than 600 10-pound bags of ice—won't have a noticeable effect on the waves that lap at the beaches in Sydney, Cape Cod, or Honolulu. But when you add up this plus all the other pieces that slough off from both Greenland and West Antarctica each year, the effect adds up: about a millimeter a year, or a few inches over the past 25 years. And the ice sheets shed faster and faster each year.Ice sheets, like those in Greenland and Antarctica, lock up about two percent of all the water that exists on the world’s surface (most of the rest, unsurprisingly, is in the ocean). Greenland spits about 270 billion tons of ice into the ocean each year—more when it's warmer and a little less during cool years. Antarctica currently dumps about 100 billion tons each year, but that number is very likely to increase fast in coming decades.Most ice in both Greenland and Antarctica spills out into the ocean from just a few spots—so understanding the physics at work at these spots, like the towering ice wall at the bottom of Helheim Glacier, helps scientists understand how and why, exactly, the glaciers lose their ice. And they use that information to figure out how much more ice might be lost in the future.David Holland, an NYU oceanographer who was perched in a prime viewing spot when the glacier calved, explains that the physics that control both big calving events like this one, or even bigger ones (in 2010, another glacier in Greenland lost a piece about 100 square miles in area), are very similar. From events like these, they can “learn how big things break,” he says, which will tell them how the ice will behave in the future—when the climate is even warmer.This event in itself isn’t necessarily a harbinger of climate doom. “Calving happens,” says Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist from the University of Buffalo. “Ice isn't a good building material—you could never build a skyscraper out of it because it collapses under its own weight if it's more than 90 meters tall.” And at the very edge of the Helheim Glacier, the wall of ice is about 70 meters (about 230 feet) tall. So pieces break off as a natural part of the glacier mass balance cycle that would happen with or without climate change.Denise Holland, the field manager for NYU's Environmental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, captured the break-up via time-lapse photography on June 22. She and her colleagues had gone to Helheim Glacier, one of the “big 3” glaciers in Greenland where lots of ice flows from land to sea, to study just this kind of crack-up.Holland and her colleagues set up camp on the side of the rocky fjord that cups the glacier, right where the ice spills off land and meets the sea. They had arrived a few hours earlier, but Holland sets up her camera as soon as she arrives at any new camp, just in case something important happens.  And in the gloaming Greenlandic twilight, at 11:30PM, she heard some loud crackling. “It's a very strange thing to explain,” she says. “It sounded like explosions, that reverberate from one side of the fjord to the other—not like normal ice cracking,” but something bigger, louder, and more dramatic.  She ran to her camera and turned it on. And over the next 35 minutes, she and her colleagues watched in awe as giant ice blocks broke away.  And what they saw, says Holland, was a dramatic encapsulation of how complex the calving process can be. “You see these flat tabular icebergs come off, and pinnacle icebergs come off, some toe first coming up from the bottom, and others slump over and fall into the ocean,” she says.Understanding the details of how the ice sheets slough off their glaciers is key to understanding how quickly they'll shrink, explains David Holland, an oceanographer at NYU who was also perched in a prime viewing spot for the ice show.“When you're looking at sea-level rise, the place that matters is West Antarctica,” he says. But it's hard to get down to Antarctica—so the team set up camp in Greenland. “The way to learn about what will happen in West Antarctica is to look at what's happening with the glaciers in Greenland—where things are smaller and happening more rapidly. It's really a window into how sea-level change will happen in the future.”",
"The energy that drives wind originates with the sun, which heats the Earth unevenly, creating warm spots and cool spots. Two simple examples of this are sea breezes and land breezes.Sea breezes occur when inland areas heat up on sunny afternoons. That warms the air, causing it to rise. Cooler air rushes in from the ocean to take its place and presto, a wind is born. By late afternoon, a strong breeze can be blowing dozens of miles inland. A similar effect can occur near big lakes, where the wind is referred to as a lake breeze.Land breezes come at night, when inland temperatures drop enough that the ocean is now warmer than the land, reversing the effect.Similar forces produce global wind patterns that affect climate. The tropics, for example, are always hot. Air rises here and spreads north and south, high above the land. Lower down, air is pulled in from the north and south. The coriolis effect, an offshoot of the Earth's rotation, makes moving air masses curve, so that the winds converging on the Equator come from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. These winds are called the trade winds.Farther from the Equator, the surface winds try to blow toward the Poles, but the coriolis effect bends them the opposite direction, creating westerlies. This is why so many weather events in the United States come from the west.At latitudes higher than about 60°, cold surface winds try to blow toward the Equator, but, like the trade winds, they are bent by the coriolis effect, producing polar easterlies.Within the mid-latitudes, weather effects create high- and low-pressure zones, called highs and lows, respectively. Air moves from areas of high pressure to low pressure. As it moves, however, it spirals due to the coriolis effect, producing the shifting winds we experience from day to day, as highs and lows drift under the influence of the prevailing westerlies.Winds reaching the center of a low-pressure area have nowhere to go but up. This causes moisture to condense into clouds, producing storms. At the center of high-pressure areas, dry air descends from above, producing fair weather.On a smaller scale, colliding wind patterns can produce convergence, in which air also has nowhere to go but up. If one of the winds is a humid flow from a warm ocean such as the Gulf of Mexico, the result can be powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes.",
"This species of melomys is related to one that scientists say has gone extinct in the Great Barrier Reef.A small rodent that lived only on a single island off Australia is likely the world's first mammal to become a casualty of climate change, scientists reported in June 2016. The government of Australia has now officially recognized the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola) as extinct.The animal seems to have disappeared from its home in the eastern Torres Strait of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists say. The animal was last seen by a fisherman in 2009, but failed attempts to trap any in late 2014 prompted scientists to say it is likely extinct.Also called the mosaic-tailed rat, the rodent is named after its home on Bramble Cay, a small island that is at most 10 feet above sea level.The rats were first seen by Europeans on the island in 1845, and there were several hundred there as of 1978. But since 1998, the part of the island that sits above high tide has shrunk from 9.8 acres to 6.2 acres. That means the island's vegetation has been shrinking, and the rodents have lost about 97 percent of their habitat."The key factor responsible for the extirpation of this population was almost certainly ocean inundation of the low-lying cay, very likely on multiple occasions, during the last decade, causing dramatic habitat loss and perhaps also direct mortality of individuals," writes the team, led by Ian Gynther from Queensland’s Department of Environment and Heritage Protection.“For low-lying islands like Bramble Cay, the destructive effects of extreme water levels resulting from severe meteorological events are compounded by the impacts from anthropogenic climate change-driven sea-level rise,” the authors add.Around the world, sea level has risen by almost eight inches between 1901 and 2010, a rate unparalleled in the last 6,000 years. And around the Torres Strait, sea level has risen at almost twice the global average rate between 1993 and 2014. (Learn more about rising seas.)This small mammal is therefore only the first of many species that face significant risk due to a warming climate, the authors warn.The last living Rabb's fringe-limbed tree frog died in 2016 at Atlanta Zoo. The now-extinct Panamanian frog species was discovered in the wild in 2005, and just two years later no more of the frogs could be found."We knew something had to be first, but this is still stunning news," says Lee Hannah, a senior scientist for climate change biology with Conservation International.Hannah has published work suggesting that one in five species may be at risk from climate change. Those on small islands and mountains are most threatened, since they have few places to go when things change, he notes."Certainly some species will benefit from climate change, but most will see reduced ranges," adds Hannah.Still, people can work to mitigate the worst impacts, he says, by designing protected areas that can accomodate changing climate, by relocating wildlife as needed, and by reducing greenhouse gas emissions."This species could have been saved," he says.",

The now-extinct Panamanian frog species was discovered in the wild in 2005, and just two years later no more of the frogs could be found.The truth is, scientists don’t know how many species of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria exist on Earth. The most recent estimate put that number at 2 billion, and that will most likely change at some point.One thing we do know: The western black rhinoceros, the Tasmanian tiger, and the woolly mammoth are among the creatures whose populations at one point dwindled to zero, and it’s possible that species extinction is happening a thousand times more quickly because of humans.Extinction happens when environmental factors or evolutionary problems cause a species to die out. The disappearance of species from Earth is ongoing, and rates have varied over time. A quarter of mammals is at risk of extinction, according to IUCN Red List estimates.To some extent, extinction is natural. Changes to habitats and poor reproductive trends are among the factors that can make a species’ death rate higher than its birth rate for long enough that eventually, none are left.Humans also cause other species to become extinct by hunting, overharvesting, introducing invasive species to the wild, polluting, and changing wetlands and forests to croplands and urban areas. Even the rapid growth of the human population is causing extinction by ruining natural habitats.Among the most famous species driven to extinction by humans is the dodo, a bird that primarily lived in the island nation of Mauritius and was popularized by its appearance in Lewis Carroll’s book “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” Dodos were first mentioned by Dutch sailors in the late 16th century and last seen in 1662 after having been hunted to extinction. Passenger pigeons, billions of which frequently blanketed North American skies when Europeans arrived on the continent, went extinct when the last one died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.Fossils show that there have been five previous periods of history when an unusually high number of extinctions occurred in what are known as mass extinctions. Most of the Earth’s species went extinct roughly 266 million to 252 million years ago in the Permian extinction.Those losses, however, also paved the way for dinosaurs to evolve into existence, as mass extinctions create a chance for new species to emerge. Dinosaurs met their end about 65 million years ago in another mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. A large crater off of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula suggests that an asteroid most likely struck there. Scientists believe that volcanic eruptions in India caused global warming that also may have contributed to the mass extinction.Scientists are debating whether Earth is now in the midst of a sixth mass extinction. If so, it may be the fastest one ever with a rate of 1,000 to 10,000 times the baseline extinction rate of one to five species per year. Humans are largely responsible for the striking trend. Scientists believe that pollution, land clearing, and overfishing might drive half of the planet’s existing land and marine species to extinction by 2100.Slowly increasing surface temperatures caused by heightened levels of greenhouse gases likely will cause many species to move toward the Earth’s poles and higher up into the mountains to stay in habitats with the same climates. But not all species will be able to adapt quickly enough to stave off extinction and many are expected to perish.Using fewer fossil fuels by lowering the thermostat, driving less frequently, and recycling is one good way to slow the rate of extinctions. Eating less meat and avoiding products, like ivory, that are made from threatened species also can make a difference. At home, securing garbage in locked cans, reducing water usage, and refraining from using herbicides and pesticides can protect local wildlife.",
"More than 99 percent of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth are extinct. As new species evolve to fit ever changing ecological niches, older species fade away. But the rate of extinction is far from constant. At least a handful of times in the last 500 million years, 75 to more than 90 percent of all species on Earth have disappeared in a geological blink of an eye in catastrophes we call mass extinctions.Though mass extinctions are deadly events, they open up the planet for new forms of life to emerge. The most studied mass extinction, which marked the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods about 66 million years ago, killed off the nonavian dinosaurs and made room for mammals and birds to rapidly diversify and evolve.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.Though the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction is famous for being caused mainly by a huge asteroid, it’s the exception. The single biggest driver of mass extinctions appears to be major changes in Earth’s carbon cycle such as large igneous province eruptions, huge volcanoes that flooded hundreds of thousands of square miles with lava. These eruptions ejected massive amounts of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, enabling runaway global warming and related effects such as ocean acidification and anoxia, a loss of dissolved oxygen in water.The Ordovician period, from 485 to 444 million years ago, was a time of dramatic changes for life on Earth. Over a 30-million-year stretch, species diversity blossomed, but as the period ended, the first known mass extinction struck. At that time, massive glaciation locked up huge amounts of water in an ice cap that covered parts of a large south polar landmass. The icy onslaught may have been triggered by the rise of North America’s Appalachian Mountains. The large-scale weathering of these freshly uplifted rocks sucked carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and drastically cooled the planet.As a result, sea levels plummeted by hundreds of feet. Creatures living in shallow waters would have seen their habitats cool and shrink dramatically, dealing a major blow. Whatever life remained recovered haltingly in chemically hostile waters: Once sea levels started to rise again, marine oxygen levels fell, which in turn caused ocean waters to more readily hold onto dissolved toxic metals.The second worst mass extinction known to science, this event killed an estimated 85 percent of all species. The event took its hardest toll on marine organisms such as corals, shelled brachiopods, eel-like creatures called conodonts, and the trilobites.Starting 383 million years ago, this extinction event eliminated about 75 percent of all species on Earth over a span of roughly 20 million years.In several pulses across the Devonian, ocean oxygen levels dropped precipitously, which dealt serious blows to conodonts and ancient shelled relatives of squid and octopuses called goniatites. The worst of these pulses, called the Kellwasser event, came about 372 million years ago. Rocks from the period in what’s now Germany show that as oxygen levels plummeted, many reef-building creatures died out, including a major group of sea sponges called the stromatoporoids.It’s been hard to nail down the cause for the late Devonian extinction pulses, but volcanism is a possible trigger: Within a couple million years of the Kellwasser event, a large igneous province called the Viluy Traps erupted 240,000 cubic miles of lava in what is now Siberia. The eruption would have spewed greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide, which can cause acid rain. Asteroids may also have contributed. Sweden’s 32-mile-wide Siljan crater, one of Earth’s biggest surviving impact craters, formed about 377 million years ago.Though it may sound surprising, land plants may have been accessories to the crime. During the Devonian, plants hit on several winning adaptations, including the stem-strengthening compound lignin and a full-fledged vascular structure. These traits allowed plants to get bigger—and for their roots to get deeper—than ever before, which would have increased the rate of rock weathering.The faster rocks weathered, the more excess nutrients flowed from land into the oceans. The influx would have triggered algae growth, and when these algae died, their decay removed oxygen from the oceans to form what are known as dead zones. In addition, the spread of trees would have sucked CO2 out of the atmosphere, potentially ushering in global cooling.To add to the puzzle, not only did some creatures go extinct during the late Devonian, but species diversification slowed down during this time. The slowdown may have been caused by the global spread of invasive species, as high sea levels let creatures from previously isolated marine habitats mix and mingle, which let ecosystems around the world homogenize.Some 252 million years ago, life on Earth faced the “Great Dying”: the Permian-Triassic extinction. The cataclysm was the single worst event life on Earth has ever experienced. Over about 60,000 years, 96 percent of all marine species and about three of every four species on land died out. The world’s forests were wiped out and didn’t come back in force until about 10 million years later. Of the five mass extinctions, the Permian-Triassic is the only one that wiped out large numbers of insect species. Marine ecosystems took four to eight million years to recover. (Find out more about the devastation of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.)A sail-backed edaphosaurus forages amid a Permian landscape in this artist's depiction. These primitive predators, along with their close relatives the dimetrodons, though dinosaur-like in appearance, are actually considered the forerunners of mammals. Scientists think their large back fins were used to regulate body temperature.The extinction’s single biggest cause is the Siberian Traps, an immense volcanic complex that erupted more than 720,000 cubic miles of lava across what is now Siberia. The eruption triggered the release of at least 14.5 trillion tons of carbon, more than 2.5 times what’d be unleashed if every last ounce of fossil fuel on Earth were dug up and burned. Adding insult to injury, magma from the Siberian Traps infiltrated coal basins on its way toward the surface, probably releasing even more greenhouse gases such as methane.The resulting global warming was downright hellish. In the million years after the event, seawater and soil temperatures rose between 25 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit. By 250.5 million years ago, sea surface temperatures at the Equator got as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit, a hot tub's standard maximum temperature. At the time, almost no fish lived near the Equator.As temperatures rose, rocks on land weathered more rapidly, hastened by acid rain that formed from volcanic sulfur. Just as in the late Devonian, increased weathering would have brought on anoxia that suffocated the oceans. Climate models suggest that at the time, the oceans lost an estimated 76 percent of their oxygen inventory. These models also suggest that the warming and oxygen loss account for most of the extinction’s species losses.Life took a long time to recover from the Great Dying, but once it did, it diversified rapidly. Different reef-building creatures began to take hold, and lush vegetation covered the land, setting the stage for a group of reptiles called the archosaurs: the forerunners of birds, crocodilians, pterosaurs, and the nonavian dinosaurs. But about 201 million years ago, life endured another major blow: the sudden loss of up to 80 percent of all land and marine species.An artist's rendering shows hatchling nothosaurs heading for the safety of water as a hungry but terrestrial Ticinosuchus attacks near a lagoon in ancient Switzerland. Nothosaurs lived during the mid- and late Triassic period and were among the earliest reptiles to take to the sea. Because nothosaurs may have had to come ashore to lay eggs, the eggs and hatchlings would have been vulnerable to Ticinosuchus. Yet once the hatchlings reached deeper waters, they were safe—for the moment.At the end of the Triassic, Earth warmed an average of between 5 and 11 degrees Fahrenheit, driven by a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 levels. This was probably triggered by huge amounts of greenhouse gases from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, a large igneous province in central Pangaea, the supercontinent at the time. Remnants of those ancient lava flows are now split across eastern South America, eastern North America, and West Africa. The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province was enormous. Its lava volume could cover the continental U.S. in a quarter-mile of rock.The uptick in CO2 acidified the Triassic oceans, making it more difficult for marine creatures to build their shells from calcium carbonate. On land, the dominant vertebrates had been the crocodilians, which were bigger and far more diverse than they are today. Many of them died out. In their wake, the earliest dinosaurs—small, nimble creatures on the ecological periphery—rapidly diversified.The Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event is the most recent mass extinction and the only one definitively connected to a major asteroid impact. Some 76 percent of all species on the planet, including all nonavian dinosaurs, went extinct.One day about 66 million years ago, an asteroid roughly 7.5 miles across slammed into the waters off of what is now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula at 45,000 miles an hour. The massive impact—which left a crater more than 120 miles wide—flung huge volumes of dust, debris, and sulfur into the atmosphere, bringing on severe global cooling. Wildfires ignited any land within 900 miles of the impact, and a huge tsunami rippled outward from the impact. Overnight, the ecosystems that supported nonavian dinosaurs began to collapse. (Learn more about the last day of the dinosaurs’ reign.)Global warming fueled by volcanic eruptions at the Deccan Flats in India may have aggravated the event. Some scientists even argue that some of the Deccan Flats eruptions could have been triggered by the impact.Earth is currently experiencing a biodiversity crisis. Recent estimates suggest that extinction threatens up to a million species of plants and animals, in large part because of human activities such as deforestation, hunting, and overfishing. Other serious threats include the spread of invasive species and diseases from human trade, as well as pollution and human-caused climate change. (Explore National Geographic magazine's special issue on extinction.)Today, extinctions are occurring hundreds of times faster than they would naturally. If all species currently designated as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable go extinct in the next century, and if that rate of extinction continues without slowing down, we could approach the level of a mass extinction in as soon as 240 to 540 years.Climate change presents a long-term threat. Humans’ burning of fossil fuels has let us chemically imitate large igneous provinces, through the injection of billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other gases into Earth’s atmosphere each year. By total volume, these past volcanoes emitted far more than humans do today; the Siberian Traps released more than 1,400 times the CO2 than humans did in 2018 from burning fossil fuels for energy. However, humans are emitting greenhouse gases as fast as—or even faster than—the Siberian Traps, and Earth’s climate is rapidly changing as a result.As mass extinctions show us, sudden climate change can be profoundly disruptive. And while we haven’t yet crossed the 75-percent threshold of a mass extinction, that doesn’t mean things are fine. Well before hitting that grim marker, the damage would throw the ecosystems we call home into chaos, jeopardizing species around the world—including us.",

Even fewer of those have been discovered by people—but the ones we do have offer a wealth of information about what life was like on Earth from tens of thousands to billions of years ago.Fossils are the remains, impressions, or traces of ancient plants and animals—such as dinosaurs—that died under special conditions that preserved them in stone. What we most readily think of as fossils are the petrified skeletons of prehistoric creatures, in which the organic material has been replaced by minerals. But many fossils retain some of the original bone or other organic traces.More dinosaur fossils are currently being discovered than at any point in history, with somewhere in the region of one new species named by scientists around the world every week. From Abelisaurus to Zuul, there are now more than 1,200 genera of dinosaurs, and more than three quarters of them have been described since 1990.With exquisitely detailed fossils of feathered theropod dinosaurs continuing to come from China, ever-larger titanosaur sauropods being unearthed in Argentina, and remarkably complete horned dinosaurs emerging from the rocks of Canada and the United States, there are plenty of fantastic fossils to feast your eyes upon. Here, check out some of the most striking examples from the National Geographic archives.",
"Ghostly feathers of an early swift are preserved on a 48-million-year-old fossil found in Germany. Swifts and hummingbirds share an ancestor that may have evolved a few million years after the mass extinction.Nestled among white-sand beaches and brightly colored resorts, the mangrove swamps along Mexico’s Yucatán coast are a paradise for birds and the people who enjoy watching them. The densely wooded swamps, located along a major avian migration route, offer safe haven to the millions of birds that make fraught intercontinental flights between the Americas each year.My guide to this flyway rest stop, Luis Salinas-Peba, is a soft-spoken scientist at the local campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. A botanist by training, Salinas-Peba is also a master of bird identification who can name just about every species we see and hear packed among the mangroves. The mix of long-distance migrants and local species is dazzling: Blue-winged teals from Canada cross paths with endemic Yucatán wrens. Towering pink flamingos mingle with teacup-size hummingbirds.The air pulsates with the guttural alarm cries of cormorants, which get louder and more insistent as our tiny boat glides closer to their nests. Several of the sleek black birds suddenly launch into the sky, pulling my gaze upward and my thoughts toward the past, when a visitor from space 66 million years ago turned a primeval paradise into a burning apocalypse.In 1918 Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to protect birds from wanton killing. To celebrate the centennial, National Geographic is partnering with the National Audubon Society, BirdLife International, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to declare 2018 the Year of the Bird. Sign the pledge to find out this month's action and share your actions using #BirdYourWorld to increase your impact.A 3-D digital model of the “first bird,” Archaeopteryx, appears to pop out of its stony tomb thanks to x-ray scanning and photo­grammetry led by National Geographic Emerging Explorer and biologist Ryan Carney. The plumage on its wings is based on actual fossil feathers (like the one at left above) from the 150-million-year-old animal.One of the most remarkable fossils of the birdlike dinosaur Archaeopteryx, known as the Thermopolis specimen, has bones that are preserved in three dimensions rather than being flattened and distorted. By scanning this fossil, Carney and his team were able to create a digital model that is helping them understand how the animal may have moved in life.Poised like a quill pen, this fossil feather is one among many that are helping paleontologists flesh out the story of Archaeopteryx. The beautifully preserved plumage shows that the ancient animal had aerodynamic qualities, although it’s still unclear whether it was capable of powered flight.Roughly 30 miles to the east of this mangrove swamp sits Chicxulub Puerto, a calm seaside village at the center of an immense impact crater that stretches into the Gulf of Mexico. The ever shifting earth has softened the crater rim, which today is only visible using advanced satellite sensing. But its footprint on the planet tells an incredible tale. On one infamous day in the late Cretaceous period, an asteroid the size of a mountain slammed into what is now the Yucatán coast, gouging the earth and setting off a series of catastrophic events. Vaporized rock and noxious gases choked the atmosphere, forests were obliterated across the globe, and temperatures fluctuated dramatically. The impact and its aftermath ended the reign of the dinosaurs, wiping out a group of creatures that had ruled the planet for 135 million years.Well, almost.Ask just about any paleontologist, and he or she will tell you that life found a way and that some dinosaurs survived the mass extinction. That’s because today’s birds are the last remaining twig on an otherwise demolished dinosaur family tree, grown from fierce predators and sculpted by evolution into an array of flapping, feathery fowl.“There is no doubt that birds are dinosaurs,” says Luis Chiappe, director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. “The evidence is so overwhelming, I would put it next to whether you’re going to question if humans are primates.”In the hellscape left by the asteroid, what gave the ancestors of modern birds an edge over their Cretaceous cousins? It’s a tough nut to crack, given how rare birds are in the fossil record. But some exceptional discoveries over the past dozen years, coupled with advances in genetic analysis, are starting to reveal how the Chicxulub impact shaped the modern-bird origin story. That, in turn, is offering some of the first plausible clues to how birds made it through the cataclysm and exploded into the more than 10,000 species that exist today.The oldest known root on the bird family tree is the raven-size Archaeopteryx, a 150-million-year-old animal that bore a telling mix of attributes. While all of today’s birds are toothless, Archaeopteryx had jaws bristling with sharp teeth. It sported claws on its front limbs and a long, bony tail. These traits are lost in birds and instead reveal close ties to its more reptilian cousins, such as the Velociraptors of Jurassic Park fame. But Archaeopteryx had characteristics of modern birds too. Its fossils show prominent wings covered in aerodynamic feathers and a wishbone not unlike one plucked out of a chicken dinner.Not long after its discovery in the 1860s, the species was hailed as a clear transitional step between dinosaurs and birds. But few new fossils emerged to fill in the evolutionary gaps, and details about its ancestors and descendants remained murky for decades.That finally changed in 1996, when scientists unveiled the first known fossil of a feathered dinosaur unrelated to birds. Dating back nearly 130 million years, Sinosauropteryx prima was a game changer among the dozens of spectacular species being mined from early Cretaceous rock formations in China, mainly in Liaoning Province. There, primordial lakes and active volcanoes had created all the right conditions for exquisite fossil preservation. The result is a menagerie of non-avian dinosaurs and their primitive bird contemporaries, often accompanied by feathers, scales, and skin that are sometimes so detailed they even retain traces of pigment. Like Archaeopteryx, many of these animals are surreal mash-ups between the standard notion of a modern bird and classic images of a predatory dinosaur.Ostriches descend from a group of birds that arose in the late Cretaceous period and somehow lived through a mass extinction event 66 million years ago, according to the latest genetic data and fossil clues.Chickens and other land fowl also descend from a group of birds that seem to have survived the asteroid strike that killed three-quarters of life on Earth.Researchers say that modern ducks are probably in the same lineage as Vegavis iaai, which existed in the Cretaceous. Based on its fossils, Vegavis not only looked like a duck, it may have also quacked like a duck.With feathers dark as an oil slick, the non-avian dinosaur Microraptor gui probably glided between branches using stiff feathers on all four of its limbs. Nearby, the primitive bird Longipteryx chaoyangensis was flitting along waterways, snapping up fish with its reptilian, tooth-studded jaws. And Anchiornis huxleyi, a charcoal-hued dinosaur with a crown of rusty fluff, was stalking the forest floor like a goth pheasant, unable to truly fly because of its stubby, three-clawed wings.“If you didn’t see the fossils themselves, you wouldn’t think these things existed,” says Shannon Hackett, a bird curator at the Field Museum in Chicago.Despite this bounty of finds from Liaoning, paleontologists still faced gaps in the fossil record, which they sometimes tried to fill based on patchy data from mere fragments of bone. Some DNA work put the origin of modern birds deep in the Cretaceous, with many of the avian groups that exist today springing up very early in the time line. This implied a tale of mega survivorship, with a bunch of modern bird ancestors somehow making it through the mass extinction in one giant flock.Other experts argued that all birds living before the cataclysm were of the more primitive persuasion, like the ones whose fossils were found in China. Under that theory, a few ancient species survived the impact and gave rise to a “big bang” of modern bird evolution only after the rest of the dinosaurs died.For years the debate was as contentious as asking whether cheesecake is cake or pie. But in 2005 bones from Antarctica threw an exciting new ingredient into the mix: a bird that lived just before the Chicxulub event and looked stunningly similar to a modern duck.Julia Clarke at the University of Texas at Austin first described Vegavis iaai based on a fossil dated to around 67 million years ago, just before the asteroid strike. Traditional anatomical analysis and a digital reconstruction of the bones show that Vegavis seems to bear traits in its skeleton that exist only in today’s birds, signs it is indeed part of a modern line. Clarke and her team place it in the same group that includes present-day ducks and geese.In 2016 they examined a second, more complete skeleton of Vegavis and found that the animal not only looked like a duck, it may have also quacked like a duck. The fossil contains the oldest known example of a vocal organ called a syrinx, a squawk box akin to the ones found in today’s waterfowl.“Vegavis is easily one of the most important early fossils” for understanding the spread of birds, says Daniel Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Bath. This evidence of a modern bird group popping up just before the asteroid’s impact added to a growing need to rethink the polarizing positions on bird evolution that reigned in the 1990s.Closer looks at fragmentary bones, combined with more advanced methods of genetic backtracking, are fleshing out the story. In a study published in 2015, a team led by Yale University ornithology professor Richard Prum combed through the genes of 198 living bird species and calibrated their results against the latest fossil finds. Their detailed avian family tree suggests that only three modern groups got their start just before the asteroid strike.The picture emerging now shows animals that looked very much like modern birds, flying and diving and pecking in the shadow of the dinosaurs. A select few made it through the mass extinction, and that’s when birds as we know them really took off.Kemmerer, Wyoming, is built on bones. About a hundred miles northeast of Salt Lake City as the crow flies, the town sits among crumbling buttes packed with billions of fossils. Known for these riches since the 19th century, the land hosts about a dozen commercial quarries that supply trade shows and gift shops around the world. Whole family dynasties rise and fall and engage in understated rivalries over the discovery, preparation, and sale of animals that died some 52 million years ago.In the heart of Kemmerer, a couple of doors down from the first store opened by J.C. Penney, Lacey Adams perches on a metal stool at her prep table inside Tynsky’s fossil shop. As her safety glasses pin down parts of her spiky blond hair, Adams uses a compressed air chisel and needles to painstakingly remove the pale rock surrounding tea-brown bones.“I know offhand what species I’m looking at because of the ridges,” she says, turning a thin slice of stone under the light to reveal otherwise imperceptible bumps. “Like, that one’s obviously Knightia,” a member of the herring family commonly found in the region.This dry, rugged land is mostly known for its abundant fossil fish. After all, we’re standing in what used to be a massive lake, a subtropical everglade that would have made a South Floridian feel at home. As with the much older wetlands in China, this lake left an entire ecosystem frozen in time, including a valuable collection of ancient birds. Quarry workers and scientists here have unearthed partial bones, stray feathers, and well over a hundred complete bird skeletons. “They’re the best picture we have of how Earth’s biota was recovering after the great extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous,” says Lance Grande, a curator at the Field Museum and my host at the dig site.Evolutionary biologist Gavin Thomas holds a great hornbill specimen from London’s Natural History Museum. He and his team have studied 3-D scans of thousands of beaks and have added to the evidence that birds likely diversified rapidly after the rest of the dinosaurs died.Black-billed scythebill (Campylorhamphus falcularius)Grande has been coming to this paleontological wonderland, prosaically known as Fossil Lake, for more than 40 years. He usually spends a few weeks each summer mining privately held land leased by the Tynskys. The most scientifically valuable finds return with him to Chicago, and the Tynsky family keeps the rest for commercial sale.For a blistering week in late June I join him up on the butte, where a cadre of enthusiastic high school students and museum volunteers teach me how to lift large slabs out of the earth and check them for signs of past life. About midmorning on one achingly bright day, Grande asks me to pause my sweaty efforts and come see something amazing: A worker from a neighboring quarry has brought us a bird.Grande has built relationships with several other local families, and they often share their most interesting finds in case he wants to make a purchase on behalf of science; some they donate. During a tour of the town, I happened to see one long-time fossil hunter affably barter his most recent discovery—a stunningly detailed ancient shrimp—for a wad of cash and a copy of Grande’s latest book, simply titled Curators.This time, though, the potential prize came to us, lovingly displayed from the back of a dusty pickup truck. The animal is only partially uncovered from its limestone tomb, but I can clearly see delicate bones and the impression of a feathered wing. Grande wants a closer look, so we wrap it for transit and race down to the local hospital to get an x-ray. The radiology techs greet us with less surprise than I would have expected—this is clearly not their first fossilized patient. It takes a couple of tries, but by the end of our impromptu visit, Grande is convinced there’s a complete bird skeleton inside the hunk of rock. He’ll later negotiate with its discoverer to buy the fossil for further study.In this way, many of the birds from the hills around Kemmerer have come to roost in Chicago, held in the display cases and storage rooms of the Field Museum. During a visit to the storied institute a few weeks after our dig, I get a closer look at an early parrot, a perching songbird, and a type of mousebird that have all been recently described by scientists. These remains show that the postimpact ecosystem was an exceptionally diverse aviary. “Every time we find a new bird specimen, one out of two times, it’s something completely new,” Grande says. “It’s pretty exciting.”The past few years have been a boon to researchers trying to capture an image of bird life recovering after planetwide disaster. In New Mexico, paleontologists recently extracted parts of a different mousebird that lived 62 million years ago. Tsidiiyazhi abini, Navajo for “little morning bird,” is now one of the oldest known avians on this side of the extinction event. It joins a 61-million-year-old giant penguin found recently in New Zealand that looks different from other penguins that lived around the same time.All these fossils seem to fit with the latest genetic puzzle pieces. A number of papers released in 2014 looked at the full genomes of 48 living bird species and concluded that modern birds saw a rapid boom in diversity soon after the asteroid impact. The 2015 genetics study came to a similar conclusion. Even if the two teams don’t agree on some of the finer details, they each support a picture of survivors making a strong comeback.“Evolution took tens of millions of years to produce a small dinosaur with wings that could fly by flapping its arms. And then that body plan proved really successful when the asteroid hit,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. “Some of those birds made it through, and then, on the other side, there was a whole new world to conquer.”The 52-million-year-old rock layer of Fossil Lake in Wyoming holds abundant, exceptionally preserved fossils, such as this early songbird (Eozygodactylus americanus), and is intensively excavated from May through October. The site forms what Lance Grande of the Field Museum calls “the perfect storm of paleontology.”Fish (Mioplosus labracoides) are the most common finds in the Kemmerer, Wyoming, lake.The tougher question is why these particular ancestors of modern birds made it through. With more fossils and faster gene sequencing, theories about survivorship abound.Examining the lifestyles of species that lived before and after the asteroid, Daniel Field and his colleagues think the widespread disappearance of forests may have had something to do with it. In the last days of the Cretaceous, the world as a whole was a warmer, wetter place than it is today. Lush forests were abuzz with all types of exotic birds, including many that might have passed for contemporary species at first glance.Field’s research is revealing that when the asteroid hit, whole forests disappeared, and the world was plunged into an impact winter. One ancient bird group that didn’t survive was the Enantiornithes. Many of these once abundant birds have feet suited for perching in trees, suggesting they were largely arboreal. So far, not a trace of them has been found beyond the Cretaceous. Instead, the surviving bird species seem to be more at home on scrubland or at sea. All of today’s birds that depend heavily on thickly wooded zones arose well after the mass extinction, around the time forests would have been bouncing back too.Another attractive notion is that certain birds were better at proliferating in a disaster zone. In 2017 a team led by Gregory Erickson at Florida State University presented evidence that egg-laying, non-avian dinosaurs took months to incubate and hatch their young. Since many modern-style birds generally reproduce quickly and mature in a matter of days or weeks, they might have had a competitive edge over their more reptile-like cousins in the grim aftermath of the asteroid strike.Today mousebirds like this museum specimen are found only in sub-Saharan Africa. But the delicate fossil held in these vials shows that an ancient mousebird, Tsidiiyazhi abini, lived in what’s now New Mexico about 62 million years ago. The rare fossil helped scientists better pinpoint when different bird lineages split from each other, in turn supporting the notion that birds experienced an evolutionary boom soon after the asteroid strike.Depending on whom you ask, smaller bodies, polar adaptations, seed-based diets, and even nest designs may have played roles in determining who lived and who died. Solving the mystery will almost certainly require exhaustive hunts for animals that lived even closer in time to the impact. Ongoing fieldwork in places like South America, New Zealand, and the frosty deserts of Antarctica already hint at fresh discoveries in the near future. And richer genetic clues should flood the field in the coming years. At the China National GeneBank in Shenzhen, scientists are using faster, more precise techniques to churn out drafts of entire genomes for all living bird species by 2020. Their work should help researchers not only to understand living birds but also to match useful traits in fossil animals to those in the animals’ living descendants.“We’re going to see an explosion in the number of bird genomes,” Clarke says. “It’s going on right now, and it’s amazing, and I love it.”The most likely answer to the question of survivorship is that it took a suite of characteristics for certain birds to be successful. That’s why it’s important to keep adding evidence and probing each new theory. “These are global, very complex patterns that we’re trying to piece together from more than 60 million years later,” Field says. But “trying to dive into all of those related questions is gradually improving our understanding of survival across one of the most severe mass extinction events in the history of the world.”Back on the rim of the impact crater, Xavier Chiappa-Carrara, head of the academic unit of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in the Yucatán, is investigating how birds will cope with a more insidious kind of mass extinction. Mexico is home to more than a thousand bird species, and about half of them can be found in the Yucatán. Roughly 220 are migrants, spending the winter in the region or just passing through on their way between hemispheres. Today many of these birds are at risk due to habitat loss.During our visit to the mangroves, we saw a large, plastic-lined shrimp farm cutting into the coastline. Vacation homes and hotels creep around the edges of the swamp. And all across the peninsula, increasing numbers of people are drawing water from the underground aquifers that support the entire coastal ecosystem. Chiappa-Carrara and his team are now racing to understand how humans are affecting the wildlife.It’s a familiar refrain around the world. We are changing the environment so quickly, wiping out habitats and altering the climate, it’s like an invisible asteroid hit the planet.But while the ancient space rock couldn’t have cared less, people can alter the course of this catastrophe, which is why Chiappa-Carrara has hope. He and his colleagues help organize a Yucatán bird festival every year, bringing the wonders of all things feathered to the public. Every year they inspire more visitors to appreciate and protect these survivors from a fallen kingdom—the dinosaurs that still share the land and sea and sky.",
"Some 110 million years ago, this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea. The dinosaur’s undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail. Its skull still bears tile-like plates and a gray patina of fossilized skins.On the afternoon of March 21, 2011, a heavy-equipment operator named Shawn Funk was carving his way through the earth, unaware that he would soon meet a dragon.That Monday had started like any other at the Millennium Mine, a vast pit some 17 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, operated by energy company Suncor. Hour after hour Funk’s towering excavator gobbled its way down to sands laced with bitumen—the transmogrified remains of marine plants and creatures that lived and died more than 110 million years ago. It was the only ancient life he regularly saw. In 12 years of digging he had stumbled across fossilized wood and the occasional petrified tree stump, but never the remains of an animal—and certainly no dinosaurs.But around 1:30, Funk’s bucket clipped something much harder than the surrounding rock. Oddly colored lumps tumbled out of the till, sliding down onto the bank below. Within minutes Funk and his supervisor, Mike Gratton, began puzzling over the walnut brown rocks. Were they strips of fossilized wood, or were they ribs? And then they turned over one of the lumps and revealed a bizarre pattern: row after row of sandy brown disks, each ringed in gunmetal gray stone.“Right away, Mike was like, ‘We gotta get this checked out,’ ” Funk said in a 2011 interview. “It was definitely nothing we had ever seen before.”In life this imposing herbivore—called a nodosaur—stretched 18 feet long and weighed nearly 3,000 pounds. Researchers suspect it initially fossilized whole, but when it was found in 2011, only the front half, from the snout to the hips, was intact enough to recover. The specimen is the best fossil of a nodosaur ever found.A cluster of pebble-like masses may be remnants of the nodosaur's last meal.Royal Tyrrell Museum technician Mark Mitchell slowly frees the nodosaur’s foot and scaly footpad from the surrounding rock. Mitchell’s careful work will preserve for years to come the animal’s enigmatic features.Nearly six years later, I’m visiting the fossil prep lab at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the windswept badlands of Alberta. The cavernous warehouse swells with the hum of ventilation and the buzz of technicians scraping rock from bone with needle-tipped tools resembling miniature jackhammers. But my focus rests on a 2,500-pound mass of stone in the corner.At first glance the reassembled gray blocks look like a nine-foot-long sculpture of a dinosaur. A bony mosaic of armor coats its neck and back, and gray circles outline individual scales. Its neck gracefully curves to the left, as if reaching toward some tasty plant. But this is no lifelike sculpture. It’s an actual dinosaur, petrified from the snout to the hips.The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes. Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal’s skull. Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward. I can count the scales on its sole. Caleb Brown, a postdoctoral researcher at the museum, grins at my astonishment. “We don’t just have a skeleton,” he tells me later. “We have a dinosaur as it would have been.”For paleontologists the dinosaur’s amazing level of fossilization—caused by its rapid undersea burial—is as rare as winning the lottery. Usually just the bones and teeth are preserved, and only rarely do minerals replace soft tissues before they rot away. There’s also no guarantee that a fossil will keep its true-to-life shape. Feathered dinosaurs found in China, for example, were squished flat, and North America’s “mummified” duck-billed dinosaurs, among the most complete ever found, look withered and sun dried.Paleobiologist Jakob Vinther, an expert on animal coloration from the U.K.’s University of Bristol, has studied some of the world’s best fossils for signs of the pigment melanin. But after four days of working on this one—delicately scraping off samples smaller than flecks of grated Parmesan—even he is astounded. The dinosaur is so well preserved that it “might have been walking around a couple of weeks ago,” Vinther says. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”A poster for the movie Night at the Museum hangs on the wall behind Vinther. On it a dinosaur skeleton emerges from the shadows, magically brought back to life.The remarkable fossil is a newfound species (and genus) of nodosaur, a type of ankylosaur often overshadowed by its cereal box–famous cousins in the subgroup Ankylosauridae. Unlike ankylosaurs, nodosaurs had no shin-splitting tail clubs, but they too wielded thorny armor to deter predators. As it lumbered across the landscape between 110 million and 112 million years ago, almost midway through the Cretaceous period, the 18-foot-long, nearly 3,000-pound behemoth was the rhinoceros of its day, a grumpy herbivore that largely kept to itself. And if something did come calling—perhaps the fearsome Acrocanthosaurus—the nodosaur had just the trick: two 20-inch-long spikes jutting out of its shoulders like a misplaced pair of bull’s horns.Armored dinosaurs’ trademark plates usually scattered early in decay, a fate that didn’t befall this nodosaur. The remarkably preserved armor will deepen scientists’ understanding of what nodosaurs looked like and how they moved.The western Canada that this dinosaur knew was a very different world from the brutally cold, windswept plains I encountered this past autumn. In the nodosaur’s time, the area resembled today’s South Florida, with warm, humid breezes wafting through conifer forests and fern-filled meadows. It’s even possible that the nodosaur gazed out on an ocean. In the early Cretaceous, rising waters carved an inland seaway that blanketed much of what’s now Alberta, its western shore lapping against eastern British Columbia, where the nodosaur may have lived. Today those ancient seabeds lie buried under forests and rolling fields of wheat.One unlucky day this landlubbing animal ended up dead in a river, possibly swept in by a flood. The belly-up carcass wended its way downriver—kept afloat by gases that bacteria belched into its body cavity—and eventually washed out into the seaway, scientists surmise. Winds blew the carcass eastward, and after a week or so afloat, the bloated carcass burst. The body sank back-first onto the ocean floor, kicking up soupy mud that engulfed it. Minerals infiltrated the skin and armor and cradled its back, ensuring that the dead nodosaur would keep its true-to-life form as eons’ worth of rock piled atop it.The creature’s immortality hinged on each link in this unlikely chain of events. If it had drifted another few hundred feet on that ancient sea, it would have fossilized beyond Suncor’s property line, keeping it entombed. Instead Funk stumbled upon the oldest Albertan dinosaur ever found, frozen in stone as if it had gazed upon Medusa.“That was a really exciting discovery,” says Victoria Arbour, an armored-dinosaur paleontologist at Canada’s Royal Ontario Museum. Arbour has seen the fossil at various stages of preparation, but she’s not involved in its study. “It represents such a different environment from today and such a different time, and it has great preservation.” (Arbour has begun studying a similarly well preserved ankylosaur found in Montana in 2014, much of which remains hidden within a 35,000-pound block of stone. On May 10, Arbour and her colleague David Evans published a description of the Montana ankylosaur, naming it Zuul crurivastator—"Zuul, destroyer of shins"—after the monster in the film Ghostbusters.)The Canadian specimen literally defies words, in more ways than one. As this article went to press, museum staff were finalizing the creature’s scientific description and hadn’t yet settled on a common name for it. (“Mrs. Prickley,” a reference to a Canadian sketch comedy character, didn’t stick.) But already the fossil is providing new insights into the structure of nodosaurs’ armor. Reconstructing armor usually requires educated guesswork, as the bony plates, called osteoderms, scatter early in the decaying process. Not only did the osteoderms on this nodosaur preserve in place, but so did traces of the scales in between.What’s more, sheaths once made of keratin—the same material that’s in human fingernails—still coat many of the osteoderms, letting paleontologists see precisely how these sheaths exaggerated the armor’s size and shape. “I’ve been calling this one the Rosetta stone for armor,” says Donald Henderson, curator of dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.Freeing this Rosetta stone from its rocky tomb, however, proved a herculean task.After word of the discovery raced up the ladder at Suncor, the company quickly notified the Royal Tyrrell Museum. Henderson and Darren Tanke, one of the museum’s veteran technicians, scrambled aboard a Suncor jet and flew to Fort McMurray. Suncor excavators and museum staff chipped away at the rock in 12-hour shifts, shrouded in dust and diesel fumes.They eventually whittled it down to a 15,000-pound rock containing the dinosaur, ready to be hoisted out of the pit. But with cameras rolling, disaster struck: As it was lifted, the rock shattered, cleaving the dinosaur into several chunks. The fossil’s partially mineralized, cakelike interior simply couldn’t support its own weight.Tanke spent the night devising a plan to save the fossil. The next morning Suncor personnel wrapped the fragments in plaster of paris, while Tanke and Henderson scrounged for anything to stabilize the fossil on the long drive to the museum. In lieu of timbers, the crew used plaster-soaked burlap rolled up like logs.The MacGyver-like plan worked. Some 420 miles later the team reached the Royal Tyrrell Museum’s prep lab, where the blocks were entrusted to fossil preparator Mark Mitchell. His work on the nodosaur has required a sculptor’s touch: For more than 7,000 hours over the past five years, Mitchell has slowly exposed the fossil’s skin and bone. The painstaking process is like freeing compressed talcum powder from concrete. “You almost have to fight for every millimeter,” he says.Mitchell’s fight is nearly over, but it will take years, if not decades, to fully understand the fossil he uncovers. Its skeleton, for example, remains mostly obscured in skin and armor. In some ways it’s almost too well preserved; reaching the dinosaur’s bones would require destroying its outer layers. CT scans funded by the National Geographic Society have revealed little, as the rock remains stubbornly opaque.For Vinther the nodosaur fossil’s most revolutionary features may lie at its smallest scale: microscopic remnants of its original coloration. If he successfully reconstructs its distribution, he could help reveal how the dinosaur navigated its environment and used its pronounced armor.“This armor was clearly providing protection, but those elaborated horns on the front of its body would have been almost like a billboard,” he says. This advertisement could have helped woo mates or intimidate rivals—and may have stood out against a backdrop of rouge. Chemical tests of the dinosaur’s skin have hinted at the presence of reddish pigments, contrasting with the horns’ markedly light coloration.In May the Royal Tyrrell Museum unveils the nodosaur as the centerpiece of a new exhibit of fossils recovered from Alberta’s industrial sites. Now the public is marveling at what has wowed scientists for the past six years: an ambassador from Canada’s distant past, found in a moonscape by a man with an excavator.",
"Diatoms like this one can be deformed if exposed to high levels of metals in the ocean. New research suggests that lead and other metals caused deformities in prehistoric marine creatures that led to one of the Earth’s biggest mass extinctions.Toxic metals unleashed by depleted oxygen in the oceans may have helped trigger one of the largest extinctions of life in the planet’s history, new research suggests.High levels of lead, arsenic, and iron—which continue to harm animals and humans today— appear to have caused deadly deformities in tiny, plankton-like creatures that teemed in Earth’s ancient seas.The series of extinctions that occurred during the Ordovician and Silurian periods between 445 and 415 million years ago wiped out as much as 85 percent of all animal species on Earth. It was the second largest mass extinction in history, coming at a time when nearly all existing animals lived in the oceans.Scientists previously suggested a number of possible scenarios to explain the massive die-off, including rapid cooling, volcanic gases poisoning the atmosphere or deadly gamma ray bursts from a hypernova. But evidence is lacking.The new theory instead implicates changes in ocean chemistry. Metals that naturally lie on the ocean floor dissolve when seawater oxygen drops due to an influx of nutrients or other causes.A normal fossil specimen of Ancyrochitina, a plankton-like creature, is on the right, while a deformed one is on the left. Researchers say increasing metals in the ocean caused these deformities, which could have triggered mass extinctions of nearly all life on Earth 400 million years ago.Rising exposures to the metals are believed to have caused the planktonic creatures to develop into “monstrosities,” according to the study published in Nature Communications.“Imagine two, three, four individuals that have grown into each other (conjoined twins); monstrosities that have parts of specimens that are many times the size of those of regular specimens, or eggs in a string that are not fully separated,” Thijs Vandenbroucke, of France’s University of Lille and Belgium’s Ghent University wrote in an email.Vandenbroucke is a paleontologist on an international research team that examined fossils from a 1.3-mile-deep bore in the Libyan desert.The fossils displayed as many as 100 times more deformations than expected from background studies, along with up to 10 times greater heavy metal concentrations. The monstrosities were most pronounced in chitinozoans—miniscule,  bottle-shaped eggs clad in a durable organic material that lasted millions of years.Similar deformities are seen in marine and freshwater organisms today, a sign of exposure to high levels of toxic metals, says study co-author Poul Emsbo, a geochemist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado.For example, in today’s diatoms, which are encased in a “perfect, delicate box,” Emsbo says, “the valves of the little box can be completely deformed, such as a zigzag pattern.” Those deformities are routinely used to detect metal pollution in waters, he said.Diatoms like these are encased in a “perfect, delicate box,” scientist Poul Emsbo says, and “the valves of the little box can be completely deformed, such as a zigzag pattern” when they are exposed to metals in the ocean. Such deformities are routinely used to detect metal pollution in waters today.While changes in sunlight, pH or salinity levels can also trigger deformities in marine life, scientists have found little evidence that any of these occurred at the onset of the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. So the extremely high levels of toxic metals, the authors concluded, are the most likely explanation for this event, and may play a role in other ancient mass extinctions.“It’s one of the more novel hypotheses for the Ordovician extinction that I’ve heard,” says University of California, Davis paleoclimatologist Howard Spero, who was not part of the study. “I’m never comfortable with ice sheets as triggers for mass extinctions,” he says, because ice ages may be too short. “And so the idea that the ocean chemistry was playing a significant role… that’s a very intriguing hypothesis.”Heavy metals can disrupt the formation of seashells. And they also harm fish, birds, and other animals, including humans, says Myra Finkelstein, an environmental toxicologist at University of California, Santa Cruz. Lead is highly toxic across all vertebrate species. And arsenic can cause cancer.While the scientists can't say exactly what caused the depleted oxygen in the ocean millions of years ago, leading theories center on increases in nutrients, such as nitrogen, that cause plants to grow faster and use up all the oxygen.Today, expanding dead zones, such as a giant one at the mouth of the Mississippi River, are triggered by nitrogen-rich fertilizer and other runoff from cities and farms.In addition, scientists say warming temperatures are sucking oxygen out of deep ocean waters, making enormous stretches of the seas hostile to marine life. [Read more about this phenomenon here.]Although heavy metal loads could increase in these zones, it’s unlikely to occur on the scale seen during the major historical extinctions.Still, “the chemical processes that we describe are similar between the ancient and the modern ocean,” Emsbo says. “So our study might indeed help highlight processes and hidden consequences caused by fluxes of anthropogenic elements to the world’s oceans.”",
"Large zones of low-oxygen water—dead zones—form annually in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as many other areas around the world.“Dead zones” are deadly: Few or no organisms can survive in their oxygen-depleted, or hypoxic, waters. Often encompassing large swaths of ocean (and even lakes and ponds), dead zones become oceanic deserts, devoid of the usual aquatic biodiversity.Though hypoxic zones can occur naturally, many more are caused by agricultural practices across the world—a big problem for wildlife and for people.After the 1970s, dead zones became more widespread, almost doubling each decade since the 1960s. A 2008 study found more than 400 dead zones exist worldwide—anywhere excess nutrients travel downstream and into a body of water. (Read about a large dead zone in the Baltic Sea.)The largest dead zone in the world lies in the Arabian Sea, covering almost the entire 63,700-square mile Gulf of Oman. The second largest sits in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, averaging almost 6,000 square miles in size.Dead zones appear annually, May through September, in the Gulf of Mexico, after tons of nutrients from fertilizer use and sewage in the Mississippi watershed wash downstream into the Gulf. Excess nutrients spark an algal explosion, giving rise to a dead zone.Phytoplankton, microscopic algae that contain chlorophyll, require sunlight to grow, like a plant. But they float near the surface of the ocean, where they can soak up available sunlight. And they love nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus.Luckily for phytoplankton in coastal areas, humans provide superfluous nitrogen and phosphorus in fertilizer form. Phytoplankton use the supplemental nutrients to grow and reproduce—and scientists can see the huge blooms via satellite images.Phytoplankton produce oxygen during photosynthesis, so why do dead zones occur? Because of food web dynamics and decomposition.Zooplankton, small animals that spend most of their lives drifting in water, gobble the abundant phytoplankton, and then small fish consume the zooplankton. The rapid increase in algae produces more animal waste—feces and plankton corpses.Bacteria munch on the animal waste and dying algae that rain onto the ocean floor. The bacterial process of decomposition sucks up oxygen from the water, lowering the amount that remains available.Freshwater, washed into the Gulf from the Mississippi watershed, floats near the surface of the ocean because it is less dense, and therefore more buoyant than the saltwater. This stratification, or layering, prevents oxygen mixing between the freshwater and saltwater layers.A warming climate could lead to more rainfall in the Mississippi watershed, exacerbating nutrient run-off problems. Additionally, warm water naturally carries less oxygen than cooler water, making it easier for dead zones to form with climate change.When water approaches two parts per million or less of oxygen—considered low-oxygen conditions—anything mobile, like crabs, snails, and fish, will try to move away. This can make it harder for larger animals like marlin to find their usual prey.At the same time, immobile organisms can die in the low-oxygen conditions. Animals that develop near low-oxygen waters can also be affected. For example, a study found female Atlantic croaker fish developed reproductive organs more similar to testes instead of ovaries when living in hypoxic conditions.Shrimp grow more slowly, or stop growing altogether, in a low-oxygen environment. This makes it harder to find bigger shrimp, inflating the price of large shrimp for consumers. Many fishermen, however, report catching bigger fish higher in the water column—perhaps the only positive effect of dead zones.Although nutrient run-off is the primary factor affecting the size of a dead zone, other factors like wind direction and strength influence how much oxygen reaches the bottom layers of the water column. Increased mixing between the layers from wind allows more oxygen to reach the bottom layer of the ocean and produces a smaller-than-expected dead zone, like in 2018.The United States Geological Survey manages stream gauges, nitrate sensors, and long-term sites to predict the size and volume of hypoxic water in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher water levels and higher nitrate levels in May could lead to a forecast of a larger dead zone during the summer.Scientists forecasted a massive dead zone in 2019 due to heavy rainfall in the Mississippi River watershed. The excess rain—much higher than the average over the last few decades—washed more nutrients into the Gulf of Mexico. More than 153,000 tons of nitrate and 24,000 tons of phosphorus were estimated to wash into the Gulf in just the month of May. But Hurricane Barry swept through the Gulf in July, mixing the layers and reducing the extent of the dead zone to be the eigth largest recorded at 6,952 square miles.Daily forecasts also provide predicted temperature and oxygen levels for the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes in the United States, where dead zones can have big impacts on fisheries.Dead zones in some areas have been shrunk successfully over time. However, shrinking the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico is compounded by pollution that leached into the water after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the BP oil spill in 2011.The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, a collaboration of federal agencies, implemented an action plan in 2008 for controlling and reducing the hypoxic conditions in the Gulf. The task force strategizes with states to examine their individual state contributions and reduce nutrient-loading accordingly.The task force set a goal to cap the hypoxic zone size in the Gulf of Mexico to 1,900 square miles by 2015. However, the dead zone in 2017 exceeded that goal by four times—8,776 square miles.To buy more time to reach the objective, the task force extended the timeline to 2035. Updated models for estimating hypoxic areas suggest that an almost 60 percent reduction in nutrient run-off is required to reach the target goal of 1,900 square miles.The best way to accomplish this, the task force notes, is to encourage retaining nutrients at their original source—on land. This is done through better farm management practices, like using less fertilizer and using crop covers to help anchor soil in place. In states that use extensive irrigation, recapturing nutrients from irrigation water would help reduce nutrient loading.“It’s going to take a long time [to reduce nutrient loading] at the rate that we are seeing improvement,” said Bill Northey, a USDA member of the task force. “But I do believe that we are seeing some momentum. We are making more progress now than during those early years.”",
"Trees in the rainforest near Rabi, Gabon. Gabon retains much of its original rainforest and has received additional protections from new national parks created in the early 2000s.The tropics are home to nearly 80 percent of all species in the world. Those species, in their perennial warm temperatures, face the double punch from both human pressures, such as overfishing or logging, and environmental abuse, from droughts and heatwaves fueled by climate change.As a result, a collapse of global biodiversity appears imminent, according to a study in the journal Nature, unless urgent, concerted action is taken to halt and reverse species loss specifically in the tropics.Changes in rainfall patterns can turn a species-rich tropical forest into a species-poor grassland in less than a decade, said lead author Jos Barlow from England’s Lancaster University. “The most alarming finding is that we are losing tropical ecosystems in some regions,” he said.Biodiversity is the overarching term to describe the living species that provide the Earth’s life support system. A collection of plants, animals, insects, and fish make up the ecosystems that provide our food, clean water, air, and energy.The tropics provide a case study in how a lot can come from very little. While tropical regions cover just 40 percent of the Earth’s surface, they hold 91 percent of all terrestrial birds. Coral reefs that cover just a tenth of one percent of the ocean surface provide fish resources and coastal protection for up to 200 million people. Humidity in tropical forests and savanna support rainfall in some of the world's most important agricultural regions.Species losses are mainly driven by unsustainable extraction of resources like wood, minerals and palm oil and by global climate change said Barlow. "The fate of the tropics will be largely determined by what happens elsewhere in the planet.”Developed countries like the United States are the primary consumers of resources from the tropics. They’re also the main generators of carbon emissions fueling climate change.How can the free fall be slowed? Halting biodiversity loss in the tropics requires a mix of solutions, from small to global, and all of them urgent. Improving and increasing protected areas can renew habitat and rescue fragile ecosystems. And global actions such as the Paris Climate Agreement and zero deforestation commitments by international companies can influence progress on a larger scale. (One thing you can do today: eat less meat.)The Paris agreement to cut carbon emissions is just a first step. Developed countries, including China, will need to do more to keep global temperatures from rising 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). Other studies show that 3.6 degrees is simply too much for more tropical corals.Local and international efforts to protect biodiversity should be based on strong scientific evidence and must avoid having negative impacts on local peoples, says environmental social scientist Christina Hicks. Community-led conservation is often the most effective and Lancaster University researchers say there is good evidence lands controlled by indigenous and local people generally do a good job protecting biodiversity.Stronger conservation efforts alone will not be enough without tropical countries re-directing development away from wilderness areas says, Bill Laurance of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science at Australia’s James Cook University. “We’re seeing big impacts from new roads, dams and other infrastructure that fragment tropical habitat,” said Laurance who was not involved in the Nature study.Nearly all of this is driven by foreign investment such as China’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. Rather than exploiting resources in wilderness areas where few will benefit, investments in improving infrastructure like roads within and between rural lands and urban areas are more beneficial and sustainable he says. This is the kind of smart infrastructure that can help farmers get their crops to market faster and with less waste.",
"Seen from above, the Mississippi River carries sediment into the Gulf of Mexico. That sediment often contains pollutants from fertilizers that cause a spike in algal blooms.Just off the coast of Louisiana and Texas where the Mississippi River empties, the ocean is dying. The cyclical event known as the dead zone occurs every year, but scientists predict that this year's could be one of the largest in recorded history.Annual spring rains wash the nutrients used in fertilizers and sewage into the Mississippi. That fresh water, less dense than ocean water, sits on top of the ocean, preventing oxygen from mixing through the water column. Eventually those freshwater nutrients can spur a burst of algal growth, which consumes oxygen as the plants decompose.The resulting patch of low-oxygen waters leads to a condition called hypoxia, where animals in the area suffocate and die. Scientists estimate that this year the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico will spread for just over or just under 8,000 square miles across the continental shelf situated off the coast.“When the oxygen is below two parts per million, any shrimp, crabs, and fish that can swim away, will swim away,” says Louisiana State University ocean ecologist Nancy Rabalais. “The animals in the sediment [that can't swim away] can be close to annihilated.”Animals like shrimp will often search for more oxygen in shallower waters closer to the shore. Shrimp subjected to hypoxic waters are smaller, their growth stunted by pollution.One study published in 2017 noted how the dead zone affects Gulf Coast shrimpers by driving down the price of shrimp and reducing profit for local businesses.Dead zones are not unique to the Gulf of the Mexico, though the gulf's is estimated to be the world's second largest. In the world's largest dead zone, in the Baltic Sea, low oxygen devastated fisheries, and most marine animals can no longer survive there.Off the West Coast of the United States, California and Oregon crab and oyster industries have reported profit losses since the early 21st century, saying the annual wave of low oxygen ocean water has destroyed many of the animals they normally fish from the sediment.Rabalais says she's not surprised that this year's dead zone will be particularly large. Much of the Midwest saw unprecedented rainfall this spring, leading to a large increase in the amount of runoff washing into the sea. Many farmers were so affected by the intense rains that they were unable to plant crops like corn and soybean, meaning all the nitrogen and phosphorus-rich fertilizer they had spread washed into the Mississippi. Scientists are predicting that a warming climate could lead to more extreme rainfall in the region and ultimately make it more difficult to control fertilizer runoff.“The best way to solve the issue is to limit the nutrients at their source,” says Rabalais. “Once they're in the river, there's no good way to reduce them.”Eugene Turner, also from Louisiana State University, worked with Rabalais on predicting the size of the dead zone. He says better management practices could reduce the size, and suggested maintaining soil health by rotating crops, using less fertilizer, and using crop covers to keep soil in place.David Scheurer is a scientist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who studies dead zones. He notes that it's difficult to attribute a larger dead zone to just one practice like agricultural runoff, but notes that it plays a significant role in the zone’s formation. Sewage water and weather also impact the size of the dead zone.Senior director of congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation Don Parrish says farmers are already adopting practices to reduce nutrient runoff. Precision farming and artificial intelligence are both helping farmers reduce the amount of fertilizer they need to use on crops. High costs and a steep learning curve are making it difficult for the sustainable technologies to be adopted by all farmers, Parrish adds.“Scientifically we can reduce the size, but whether you can get there politically, that's still a work in progress,” he says.Scientists are now worried that warming waters in the Gulf of Mexico could increase rates of hypoxia.“That is a long-term concern,” says Scheurer. “If the climate does change in that region, there is a fair amount of evidence suggesting you would expect things to get worse.”Simply put, warm water is less capable of carrying oxygen, and a study published last year noted stretches of low-oxygen water thousands of miles across the ocean. Climate change is also expected to cause more intense precipitation and flooding in the Midwest, which will contribute to the amount of chemical fertilizer washed into the ocean.Both Scheurer and Rabalais, however, say it's too early to say that the gulf's dead zone is already being made worse by climate change.Rabalais says she expects the dead zone to worsen in the future, further harming the ecosystem.“You of course remember the BP oil spill?” she asks. “This is a slow drip kind of change in the system thats been happening over decades, but it's just as consequential.”",
"The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean on Earth. It spans 60 million square miles from California to China, and in certain regions extends tens of thousands of feet below the surface of the water.To get a sense of just how immense the Pacific Ocean is, you could put all of Earth's landmasses together, and the Pacific would still be larger.The name Pacific is a version of pacify or peaceful. It was named by the explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1520 as he sailed through a calm patch of water on the ocean. Despite its name, the Pacific is a vast body of water teeming with activity. Much of the ocean is still waiting to be explored, but human activities like industrial fishing, deep-sea mining, and fossil-fuel burning are already changing it in significant ways. The vast body of water is home to some of the most unique life forms on Earth and contains the deepest reaches known to humankind.Here's a look at some key features of this great ocean, as well as issues affecting it.The Pacific Ocean stirs up some of the strongest hurricanes ever seen. For example, in 2018 the strongest storm of the year was Super Typhoon Mangkhut. It hit the Philippines in late September before dissipating over mainland China. At its strongest, the storm’s winds topped 165 miles per hour, uprooting trees, destroying homes, and causing deadly mudslides.Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are actually different names for the same weather pattern. Hurricane is used in the eastern Pacific, typhoon in the northwestern Pacific, and cyclone in the southwestern Pacific. The storms feed on the energy of warm water, making the Pacific a powerful breeding ground for them.The Pacific basin is called the “Ring of Fire” because of the area of earthquake and volcanic activity around its edges. The resulting chain of volcanoes is roughly 25,000 miles long and springs to life where the Pacific tectonic plate slides against or collides into the other tectonic plates that circle it. The subduction of tectonic plates—when a plate slides beneath another one—in certain areas also helps form deepwater trenches.The Mariana Trench is one such deep ocean trench that sits along the Ring of Fire in the Mariana Archipelago east of the Philippines. It's the deepest known spot on the planet—deeper than Mt. Everest is tall, reaching down roughly seven miles. The deepest point in the trench is called Challenger Deep, at 36,000 feet down.Humans descended into the Challenger Deep in 1960 inside a U.S. Navy submersible, and film director and explorer James Cameron made a solo trip in 2012. Today, scientists periodically send remotely operated vehicles to the bottom of the trench for various research purposes.Scientists are just beginning to learn about life in the deepest parts of the oceans. Creatures in the deep sea exist in waters with zero light, crushing pressure, and conditions no human could ever survive. Yet the deep sea is home to a diverse group of sea creatures with mysterious lives, from glowing lures to huge eyes. Scientists know little about many of these creatures and the roles they may play in the global ecosystem because they are so hard to study.Burning fossil fuels and releasing carbon dioxide into the air doesn't just alter the makeup of our atmosphere. Oceans, which absorb about 30 percent of the CO2 released into the atmosphere, are also highly susceptible to the changes taking place in a warming world. When that carbon is absorbed, a series of chemical reactions takes place that produces more hydrogen ions and leads to more acidic waters. According to NOAA, the ocean's pH has dropped by 0.1 pH units in the past 200 years. That equates to ocean waters that are 30 percent more acidic. More acidic water is making it harder for organisms that make shells out of calcium carbonate, like clams and corals, to survive.From 2014 to 2016, a warm weather anomaly often referred to as the blob was responsible for killing off high percentages of marine life in the Pacific. On the U.S. West Coast, many marine mammals like sea lions and otters were turning up dead. Some scientists have since speculated that the Pacific blob was a sign of what life may be like in a warming world.Scientists haven't conclusively found an explanation for what caused the blob. Some have suggested it's at the extreme end of a cyclical ocean weather pattern, while many say anthropogenic climate change has created the perfect conditions to concentrate intense, warm ocean water over the eastern Pacific.Between Hawaii and California is an area larger than the state of Texas that has been dubbed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Though the name may conjure up a massive island of plastic jutting out of the sea, 94 percent of the plastics found in the patch are actually microplastics—tiny pieces of plastic smaller than a grain of rice and often impossible to see with the naked eye. Much of the heaviest plastic found in the patch is abandoned fishing gear, often referred to as “ghost nets.” Ghost nets threaten marine life because they can easily ensnare animals swimming by.The garbage patch in the Pacific is the largest known on the planet, but several others can be found in other oceans (five main ones are often reported). Debris tends to collect in swirling, circular currents called gyres.Experts say that cleaning up the patch entirely is likely impossible, but some are trying to at least mitigate the problem. One Dutch company called Ocean Cleanup has invested $32 million as of early 2019 in cleaning up the Pacific Garbage Patch. Early ocean trials have so far shown mixed results.Billions of people around the world rely on fish as their primary source of protein and millions rely on it for their livelihood. Many of the world's populations of wild fish harvested for humans to eat are now overfished, or over exploited beyond what the fish can replace through reproduction. The precise number is often debated by conservationists but the United Nations has estimated about a third of global fisheries are overfished. Whether a mile off a country's coast or far out to sea, overfishing affects much of the Pacific Ocean, although there have been encouraging signs that some fisheries are recovering.Successful fisheries managers monitor the health of their stocks regularly to dictate when a region can be fished, how much, and when “no-take zones” should be created to allow a population more time to reproduce and multiply.The Pacific Ocean is also the site of much of the world's high seas fishing, both legal and illegal, a practice that has been criticized by conservationists as being unsustainable as well as unprofitable. Recent international discussions have raised the question of whether nations should unite to limit or even prohibit fishing on the high seas, which currently faces few restrictions.",
"The Ring of Fire is a roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and seismically active sites that outline the Pacific Ocean.Also known as the Circum-Pacific Belt, the Ring of Fire traces the meeting points of many tectonic plates, including the Eurasian, North American, Juan de Fuca, Cocos, Caribbean, Nazca, Antarctic, Indian, Australian, Philippine, and other smaller plates, which all encircle the large Pacific Plate.The plates are constantly sliding past, colliding into, or moving above or below each other. This movement results in deep ocean trenches, volcanic eruptions, and earthquake epicenters along the boundaries where the plates meet, called fault lines.The Ring of Fire is home to the deepest ocean trench, called the Mariana Trench. Located east of Guam, the 7-mile-deep Mariana Trench formed when one tectonic place was pushed under another.The tectonic activity along the Ring of Fire also results in about 90% of the world’s earthquakes, including the Valdivia Earthquake of Chile in 1960, the strongest recorded earthquake at 9.5 out of 10 on the Richter scale.The Ring of Fire is also where an estimated 75% of the planet’s volcanoes are located, such as Mount Tambora of Indonesia, which erupted in 1815 and became the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history.",
"Like the food particles that clump together in the middle of a kitchen sink, plastic debris is gathering in the deepest reaches of the ocean.A new study published in Geochemical Perspectives found evidence of microplastic (plastic smaller than five millimeters) gathering in large quantities in the deepest parts of the oceans, and that could account for “missing” plastic that has stumped scientists to date.A team of researchers from the Chinese Academy of Science analyzed thirteen regions by looking at previous studies and collecting their own samples. Earlier this year, a plastic bag was found in the deepest reaches of the Mariana Trench, 36,000 feet below the surface. Researchers spotted it while using video to survey the region for plastic debris.To better understand plastic that can't as easily be spotted, the Chinese researchers analyzed water samples and broke out the amount of microplastic they found in a single liter, about four cups.In the trench's most polluted regions, they found as many as 2,000 pieces of microplastic in one liter. The only other deep sea region that topped the Mariana Trench was found at the Hausgarten Observatory, which sits in the Arctic Greenland Sea to the west of Svalbard. There, researchers sampled at depths of more than 18,000 feet and found as much as 3,400 pieces of microplastic in one liter.A study published in 2014 estimated that nearly 99 percent of the ocean's plastic was unaccounted for. About 300 million tons of plastic is produced every year, but after a research vessel fished for plastic in five major gyres around the world, they found only about 40,000 tons. It's thought that much of that missing plastic is in the form of hard-to-fish microplastic and is possibly being eaten by sea creatures.In fact, it's the sea creatures that may be helping microplastic sink to the bottom of the sea.“Zooplankton ingest microplastic, and it sinks with their poo,” says Alina Wieczorek, a marine biologist from the National University of Ireland. Earlier this year, Wieczorek published research finding an abundance of microplastic in deep-sea fish.Of the 11 types of plastic looked at in the study, only two were found to be buoyant. The other nine all eventually sink. Researchers observed plastics that were blue, red, white, green, and purple. They ranged in shape from round to rods. Small pieces of microplastic that are covered in biofilm—thin layers of bacteria, plankton, and other small organisms—also eventually sink to the bottom of the ocean.“To reconstruct the pressure from deep-sea environments is quite impossible,” says Wieczorek.Deep-sea research is among the most difficult and expensive to perform. Wieczorek says much of what biologists know about the impact of microplastics in sea creatures is inferred from studying species at shallower depths.Previous studies have shown that sea creatures may be likely to consume microplastic because it looks or smells like food, but microplastic often accumulates toxins in the water. Large, long-living marine mammals consume an abundance of smaller fish over time, leading them to accumulate plastic.Everything from feeding to hunting and mating behaviors can be impacted. Large whales have been found beached with 17 pounds of plastic inside of them.While scientists are starting to understand how microplastics will alter shallow ecosystems, the deep sea is by far less well understood.“The hadal zone [deepest part of the ocean] could be one of the largest microplastic sinks on Earth,” the study concludes, adding that the impacts of storing the world's plastic are largely still unknown.",
"Humans rarely encounter frilled sharks, which prefer to remain  in the oceans' depths, up to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) below the  surface. Considered living fossils, frilled sharks bear many physical  characteristics of ancestors who swam the seas in the time of the  dinosaurs. This 5.3-foot (1.6-meter) specimen was found in shallow water in Japan in 2007 and  transferred to a marine park. It died hours after being caught.",
"Plastics like these bottles are targeted for cleanup by the Ocean Cleanup's garbage collection machine, which launched as a test on Saturday, September 8, 2018.The campaign to rid the world’s oceans of plastic trash marked a turning point last September as a giant, floating trash-collector steamed out of San Francisco on a mission to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.Over the course of the next year, the device will undergo the ultimate tests and face some tough questions: Can technology prevail over nature? Did the engineers at The Ocean Cleanup in the Netherlands invent the first feasible method for extracting large amounts of plastic debris from the sea? Or will the wilds of the open Pacific tear it to shreds, turning the cleaner itself into plastic trash? Alternately, even if a Pacific storm does not devour the device, will it attract marine animals such as dolphins and turtles and fatally entangle them?“I don’t think it’s going to work, but I hope it does,” says George Leonard, the Ocean Conservancy’s chief scientist. “The ocean needs all the help it can get.”The project is the creation of Boyan Slat, a 24-year-old Dutch college dropout who raised more than $30 million on a five-year quest to build an ocean-cleaning machine. His inspiration dates to a holiday diving trip in Greece he took as a teenager, where he encountered so much plastic, he decided to make cleaning up the ocean his mission. Back home in the Netherlands, he quit his aerospace engineering studies at the Delft University of Technology and founded the nonprofit Ocean Cleanup, where he is now CEO with a staff of 65 engineers and scientists.The praise for Slat's effort so far has been lavish and the criticism harsh. He has won accolades from the King of Norway, a top environmental award from the United Nations, and his name appears on various lists, including one by Forbes magazine, of rising young entrepreneurial leaders. He has also been taken to task by scientists for under-estimating the potential risks to marine life the device will create.Miriam Goldstein, director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington think-tank, and a long-time critic of the project, says the cleaning device can mimic a fish aggregating device, known as FADs and used by fishermen to draw ocean-going fish to a central area where they can be easily caught. As fish congregate at the device, they could then attract marine animals and become entangled.“Any time you have a floating object in the ocean of any reasonable size, fish like to congregate under it,” she says. “It’s definitely going to become a FAD. It’s not inherently bad for fish to gather, but it’s also not known what effect that will have.”More fundamentally, some say the project diverts attention away from what is regarded as a more cost-effective, consequential way to save the oceans—by preventing plastic trash from flowing into it in the first place.“What’s floating on the surface of the ocean gyres is only three percent of the plastics that enters the ocean every single year,” says Eben Schwartz, marine debris program manager for the California Coastal Commission. “I understand why people are fascinated by this bright, shiny new object. But it’s sort of a digital solution to an analogue problem. The solution to plastic pollution entering our ocean starts on land.”A whale shark swims beside a plastic bag in the Gulf of Aden near Yemen. Although whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, they're still threatened by ingesting small bits of plastic.Schwartz and Leonard point to twinned annual beach cleanups on September 15 sponsored by the Ocean Conservancy, which conducts an international cleanup that last year collected 20.4 million pounds of trash in more than 100 nations, and the California Coastal Commission, which last year retrieved between 800,000 and 1 million pounds of trash from California beaches.Slat, in an interview with National Geographic, reiterated his long-held view that prevention is the first step toward protecting the oceans.“I think it should be clear that humanity can do more than one thing at a time,” he says. “But the plastic in the ocean is not going to go away by itself. We see plastic dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, so I think it’s obvious we have to do both. It’s not a hopeful situation if the only thing you can do is not make it worse.”The Ocean Cleanup’s engineering team has been assembling the device in Alameda, California, for a year. On Saturday, it will be towed out into international waters off California for a final round of testing, and then towed to the garbage patch, arriving in mid-October for what is a planned year-long deployment.Plastic trash accumulates in ocean gyres, which are large systems of circular currents. The Pacific Garbage Patch, which collects in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, is the largest and best-known assemblage of floating trash. It's more plastic soup than patch, however; there is no solid surface on which to stand. Most of it is made up of microplastics, plastics ground down into tiny bits by sunlight and wave action. Slat’s team of scientists say the garbage patch also contains an estimated 79,000 tons of abandoned fishing gear.Slat’s cleanup system has gone through several design changes. At first it was to be tethered to the ocean floor, but that scheme was scrapped in favor of the current design as a passive drifting system.Physically, the device consists of a high-density polyethylene pipe 4 feet in diameter and 1,969 feet long. It will rest on the ocean surface in the shape of a U, with a screen skirt that hangs below the surface. It moves slowly through the water, driven by currents and winds, and can capture plastics on the surface, as well as debris almost 10 feet below the surface. If the device performs as designed, 60 additional booms will be deployed.If everything goes as planned, it should collect 100,000 to 150,000 pounds of garbage in the first year. The full fleet of 60 devices—which will be larger—will collect more than 30 million pounds a year, Slat estimates.The system is equipped with lights and an anti-collision system to prevent ships from running into it. Cameras, sensors, and satellites enable the project’s managers to direct it.As plastic is collected, it will be picked up by a ship and transported back to California and then on to Europe to the Ocean Cleanup’s customers, Slat says.“It is pretty exciting to see it come to life,” Slat says. “But we still have to do it and we’re just getting started. The moment I am looking forward most to is when we are taking the first plastic back and it’s proven technology. I am highly confident we have been able to eliminate every risk we can eliminate before going to the garbage patch. I feel pretty good about our chances of success.”The remaining challenges, he says, are things that were hard to model. One is how much plastic will the system pick up? The Ocean Cleanup's stated goal is to clean up 50 percent of the garbage patch within five years.“It’s nice there is a cleanup system, but if it doesn’t collect any plastic, it’s not very useful. So how efficient is the cleanup system and what’s the capture threshold and what’s the smallest piece we can collect? Within the first few months, we hope to get the answer to that all-important question,” says Slat.The final challenge, he says, is survivability. The Ocean Cleanup’s engineers designed the device to survive a 100-year storm event. And the design change that allows waves to run through the system means that it won’t have to absorb the destructive energy of waves.“Can it handle the worst conditions on the face of the planet? The ocean’s wind, waves, currents, salt, corrosion—all of these different destructive forces that are working against you. If by April we don’t sustain any significant damage, we can unpop a cork and celebrate,” Slat says.",
"On a boat off Costa Rica, a biologist uses pliers from a Swiss army knife to try to extract a plastic straw from a sea turtle’s nostril. The turtle writhes in agony, bleeding profusely. For eight painful minutes the YouTube video ticks on; it has logged more than 20 million views, even though it’s so hard to watch. At the end the increasingly desperate biologists finally manage to dislodge a four-inch-long straw from the creature’s nose.Raw scenes like this, which lay bare the toll of plastic on wildlife, have become familiar: The dead albatross, its stomach bursting with refuse. The turtle stuck in a six-pack ring, its shell warped from years of straining against the tough plastic. The seal snared in a discarded fishing net.But most of the time, the harm is stealthier. Flesh-footed shearwaters, large, sooty brown seabirds that nest on islands off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, eat more plastic as a proportion of their body mass than any other marine animal, researchers say: In one large population, 90 percent of the fledglings had already ingested some. A plastic shard piercing an intestine can kill a bird quickly. But typically the consumption of plastic just leads to chronic, unrelenting hunger.“The really sad thing about this is that they’re eating plastic thinking it’s food,” says Matthew Savoca, a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Imagine you ate lunch and then just felt weak and lethargic and hungry all day. That would be very confusing.” Fish such as anchovies, Savoca has found, eat plastic because it smells like food once it’s covered with algae. Seabirds, expending energy their malnourished bodies don’t have, roam farther in search of real food, only to drag back plastic waste to feed their young.What makes plastic useful for people—its durability and light weight—increases the threat to animals. Plastic hangs around a long time, and a lot of it floats. “Single-use plastics are the worst. Period. Bar none,” Savoca says, referring to straws, water bottles, and plastic bags. Some 700 species of marine animals have been reported—so far—to have eaten or become entangled in plastic.We don’t fully understand plastic’s long-term impact on wildlife (nor its impact on us). We haven’t been using the stuff for very long. The first documented cases of seabirds ingesting plastic were 74 Laysan albatross chicks found on a Pacific atoll in 1966, when plastic production was roughly a twentieth of what it is today. In hindsight, those birds seem like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine.",
"A quarter of a billion years ago, long before dinosaurs or mammals evolved, the predator Dinogorgon, whose skull is shown here, hunted floodplains in the heart of today's South Africa. In less than a million years Dinogorgon vanished in the greatest mass extinction ever, along with about nine of every 10 plant and animal species on the planet."Welcome to the Black Triangle," said paleobiologist Cindy Looy as our van slowed to a stop in the gentle hills of the northern Czech Republic, a few miles from the German and Polish borders. The Black Triangle gets its name from the coal burned by nearby power plants. Decades of acid rain generated by power-plant emissions have devastated the region's ecosystems. Yet the treeless hills looked healthy and green.I tried to hide my surprise. For months I'd been on the trail of the greatest natural disaster in Earth's history. About 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, something killed some 90 percent of the planet's species. Less than 5 percent of the animal species in the seas survived. On land less than a third of the large animal species made it. Nearly all the trees died. Looy had told me that the Black Triangle was the best place today to see what the world would have looked like after the Permian extinction. This didn't look like apocalypse.We saw the first signs of death as we walked into the hills—hundreds of fallen timbers lay hidden in the undergrowth. A forest once grew here. Half a mile (0.8 kilometers) uphill we found the trunks of a stand of spruce, killed by acid rain. No birds called, no insects hummed. The only sound was the wind through the acid-tolerant weeds."The forest that grew here a few decades ago contained dozens of species of plants," said Looy. "Now there are only a few grassy species."Looy picked up a spruce cone. Pollen from the trees around us might be preserved inside. She believes that the Permian extinction was caused by acid rain following a massive release of volcanic gases. She wants to compare tree pollen from a modern forest killed by acid rain with fossil pollen found in Permian rocks.Like a homicide detective at a crime scene, Looy sealed the cone in a plastic bag for later lab work. "You could say we're working on the greatest murder mystery of all time," she said.Looy is one of many scientists trying to identify the killer responsible for the largest of the many mass extinctions that have struck the planet. The most famous die-off ended the reign of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. Most researchers consider that case closed. Rocks of that age contain traces of an asteroid that struck Earth, generating catastrophic events from global wildfires to climate change. But the Permian detectives are faced with a host of suspects and not enough evidence to convict any of them.To understand this extinction, I wanted first to get a sense of its scale. That's difficult—sediments containing fossils from the end of the Permian are rare and often inaccessible. One site that preserves the extinction's victims lies about a half day's drive inland from Cape Town, South Africa, in a scrubland known as the Karoo."The Karoo is the kind of place where people fall asleep at the wheel," said Roger Smith, a paleontologist at the South African Museum, as we drove across the treeless land. "But it may be the best place to see the terrestrial realm's transition from the Permian to the Triassic period."We ascended through sheep-ranching country toward the Lootsberg Pass. The rocks that surrounded us date from the late Permian. For every yard of altitude we gained, we traveled tens of thousands of years forward in time, heading for the Permian's conclusion.If we had driven here before the extinction, we would have seen animals as abundant and diverse as those of today's Serengeti, except most would have belonged to a group known as synapsids. Often called mammal-like reptiles—they looked like a cross between a dog and a lizard—the synapsids were Earth's first great dynasty of land vertebrates."We've found fossils of many kinds of synapsids in these rocks, especially tortoise-beaked dicynodonts, which likely lived in herds and browsed on vegetation along the riverbanks," said Smith. "There were also a lot of smaller grazers and root grubbers, like Diictodon, a dachshund-shaped dicynodont that probably dug up roots and shoots. They were preyed upon by gorgonopsians—fleet-footed synapsid carnivores with needle-sharp teeth."The late Permian rocks we passed as we neared Lootsberg Pass capture the synapsids at the height of their reign. For more than 60 million years they were Earth's dominant land vertebrates, occupying the same ecological niches as their successors, the dinosaurs.Smith slowed at a switchback, rolled down the window, and pointed to a horizontally banded cliff. "See that road cut?" he asked. "That's your Permo-Triassic transition zone. Brace yourself, you're about to go through the extinction." The fossils embedded in this road cut suggest that synapsids took a savage hit at the end of the Permian.A synapsid known as Lystrosaurus appears in these sediments. Smith had a skull of the animal in his truck. Its flat face gave it the look of a bulldog with tusks. In the first few yards of the transition zone, only one or two Lystrosaurus fossils have been found scattered among all the diverse late Permian animals. Higher up, the diversity suddenly dwindles. Dozens of species of Permian synapsids disappear, leaving Lystrosaurus and a few others in early Triassic rocks. Animals were still abundant, but the community they formed was about as species rich as a cornfield.Plants were also hit by the extinction. Evidence for the scale of damage to the world's forests comes from the Italian Alps. I joined a research team led by Henk Visscher of the University of Utrecht at the Butterloch gorge, where exposed fossil beds cover the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. The beds lie high on a cliff, accessible only by climbing piles of debris. I anxiously followed veteran climber Mark Sephton up a slope of loose rocks to a ledge. Sephton used his hammer to chip bits of rock from the layers that chronicle the extinction. Each fragment contains microscopic fossils—pieces of plants and fungi. The lower layers, dating from prior to the extinction, contain lots of pollen, typical of a healthy conifer forest. But in rocks from the Permo-Triassic boundary the pollen is replaced by strands of fossilized fungi—as many as a million segments in some golf-ball-size rocks.All that fungi in boundary rocks may represent an exploding population of scavengers feasting on an epic meal of dead trees. "We think it's a wood-decaying fungus," says Looy, who works with Visscher. "When a tree dies, it falls. As it decays, fungi grow into it from spores on the ground, decomposing it."Visscher and his colleagues have found elevated levels of fungal remains in Permo-Triassic rocks from all over the world. They call it a "fungal spike." The same rocks yield few tree pollen grains. Visscher's conclusion: Nearly all the world's trees died en masse.On the drive from Butterloch a team member handed me a soft, brown banana—a leftover from lunch. "This is how you can imagine the Permian extinction," he said. "Rotting biomass.""It's not easy to kill so many species," says Doug Erwin, a Smithsonian Institution paleontologist. "It had to be something catastrophic." Erwin and geologist Samuel Bowring of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have dated volcanic ash in Chinese sediments laid down during the extinction. Bowring thinks the extinction took place in as little as 100,000 years—quicker than the click of a camera shutter on a geologic scale of time. Suspects must be capable of killing with staggering swiftness both on land and in the seas. As I spoke with some of the researchers on the killer's trail, I learned how many suspects there are—and how difficult it is to develop a tight case.An enormous asteroid impact is the prime suspect of Gregory Retallack, a geologist at the University of Oregon. The collision would have sent billions of particles into the atmosphere, he explains. They would have spread around the planet, then rained down on land and sea.Retallack has discovered tiny quartz crystals marked with microscopic fractures in rocks from the time of the extinction in Australia and Antarctica. "You need staggering force, many times greater than a nuclear explosion, to create this shocked quartz," said Retallack. "Only an impact could deform it this way." A team of researchers recently found what may be that impact's footprint buried below Australia—a 75-mile-wide (120-kilometer-wide) crater left by an asteroid more than three miles (4.8 kilometers) across.I asked Retallack what an impact would be like if we had been standing a few hundred miles from ground zero. "You'd feel a shudder," he replied. "Clouds of noxious gases would billow in and block out the sun for months. Temperatures would drop, and corrosive acid snow and rain would fall. After the clouds cleared, the atmosphere would be thick with carbon dioxide from fires and decaying matter. CO2 is a greenhouse gas; it would have contributed to global warming that lasted millions of years."The short-term effects alone—cold, darkness, and acid rain—would kill plants and photosynthetic plankton, the base of most food chains. Herbivores would starve, as would the carnivores that fed on the plant-eaters.Other Permian detectives suspect the killer oozed up from the sea. For years scientists have known that the deep ocean lacked oxygen in the late Permian. But most life is concentrated in shallow water, in places like reefs. In 1996 English geologists Paul Wignall and Richard Twitchett of the University of Leeds reported the first evidence of oxygen depletion, or anoxia, in rocks that formed under shallow water at the time of the extinction.Pollution sometimes turns waters anoxic today in regions that lack good circulation. Local die-offs of marine life can result. But Wignall suspects that the entire ocean may have stagnated in Permian times. What could still the currents that oxygenate the ocean? Perhaps a lack of ice caps during the late Permian led to the stagnation. Normally temperature differences between polar and equatorial waters create convective currents. Without those currents, anoxic water could have built up, spilling into shallow water as sea levels rose and smothering marine life.Permian oceans also might have been poisoned with CO2, according to Andrew Knoll, a paleobiologist at Harvard. Oceanic bacteria eat organic matter, producing bicarbonate as a digestive by-product. Without currents, the load of bicarbonate could have grown in the deep ocean. Knoll thinks something big—he's not sure what—disturbed the seas. Bicarbonate-laden water rose from below, he suggests. As it did, it depressurized. Dissolved bicarbonate was released as CO2, making the seas bubble at times like a glass of soda.The crisis for marine animals would have started when toxic levels of CO2 entered the shallows. Fish would have grown lethargic and slowly fallen asleep. "Perhaps the Permian ended with a whimper and not a bang," said Knoll.Another suspect—a deadly epoch of volcanic eruptions—left a million-square-mile (2.6-million-square-kilometer) fingerprint in Siberia. Below the town of Norilsk lies a two-and-a-half-mile-thick (four-kilometer-thick) pile of lava, overgrown by conifers. Geologists call this vast lava field the Siberian Traps. It wasn't produced by one volcano. "Thick, pulsing flows of glowing magma gushed out from numerous broad, flat volcanoes," said geologist Paul Renne of the Berkeley Geochronology Center. "Hundreds of cubic miles spread across Siberia—enough to cover the Earth to a depth of about 20 feet (6 meters)."For decades scientists have known the Siberian Traps were formed around the time of the Permian extinction. Could the greatest extinction be related to the greatest volcanic eruptions? Renne, an expert at determining the ages of rocks, has been trying to work out the timing of the events. His lab is filled with machines—tangles of high-voltage cables, vacuum lines, and stainless steel—that date rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. Renne secured chunks of lava from the Siberian Traps and Permo-Triassic boundary rocks from China. He has determined the two events occurred within 100,000 years of each other. Renne doubts that's a coincidence.But the Siberian Traps volcanoes didn't cause the extinction by swamping the world with lava. As volcanic gases poured into the skies, they would have generated acid rain, and sulfate molecules would have blocked sunlight and cooled the planet. Glaciation would have reduced the volume of water in the ocean, storing it as ice. Sea level would have dropped, killing marine life in the shallows and severely reducing diversity. Lowering sea level can also release the ocean's methane, which, combined with CO2 from the eruptions and decaying organic matter, would likely produce greenhouse conditions. "In 1783 a volcano called Laki erupted in Iceland," said Renne. "Within a year global temperature dropped almost two degrees. Imagine a Laki erupting every year for hundreds of thousands of years."Each scientist I met left me thinking that he or she was a clue or two away from solving the crime. But as Doug Erwin of the Smithsonian cautioned me, "the truth is sometimes untidy." The Permian extinction reminds him of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, in which a corpse with 12 knife wounds is discovered on a train. Twelve different killers conspired to slay the victim. Erwin suspects there may have been multiple killers at the end of the Permian. Maybe everything—eruptions, an impact, anoxia—went wrong at once.Could it happen again? "Sure," Erwin replied. "The question is when. Tomorrow? A hundred million years from now?"I left Erwin's office at the Smithsonian and wandered into the dinosaur hall. Behind the dinosaurs was a case with skulls of Permian synapsids. They don't get many visitors. Lystrosaurus, the synapsid that inherited the barren world of the Triassic, stared out empty-eyed. With its competition gone, Lystrosaurus spread across the world, from Russia to Antarctica.Death creates opportunity. Survivors occupy vacant niches. Within a million years synapsid diversity recovered. One lineage produced our ancestors, the first mammals. Now we are creating a new mass extinction, wiping out countless species. Will life be as resilient this time? I remembered the acid-tolerant plants of the Black Triangle, where we've done so much to destroy an ecosystem. If life can survive the Permian extinction, it can survive anything.",
"A sail-backed edaphosaurus forages amid a Permian landscape in this artist's depiction. These primitive predators, along with their close relatives the dimetrodons, though dinosaur-like in appearance, are actually considered the forerunners of mammals. Scientists think their large back fins were used to regulate body temperature.The Permian period, which ended in the largest mass extinction the Earth has ever known, began about 299 million years ago. The emerging supercontinent of Pangaea presented severe extremes of climate and environment due to its vast size. The south was cold and arid, with much of the region frozen under ice caps. Northern areas suffered increasingly from intense heat and great seasonal fluctuations between wet and dry conditions. The lush swamp forests of the Carboniferous were gradually replaced by conifers, seed ferns, and other drought-resistant plants.Early reptiles were well placed to capitalize on the new environment. Shielded by their thicker, moisture-retaining skins, they moved in where amphibians had previously held sway. Over time, they became ideally suited to the desert-type habitats in which they thrive today.Being cold-blooded, reptiles had to find ways to deal with big daily variations in temperature, from below freezing at night to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) during the day. Some of the primitive pelycosaurs, which measured up to ten feet (three meters) long, had sail-like structures on their backs that are thought to have acted as heat exchangers, catching the sun in the morning to help warm the sluggish creatures.Later, other mammal-like reptiles known as therapsids found an internal solution to keeping warm—scientists suspect they eventually became warm-blooded, conserving heat generated through the breakdown of food. These more metabolically active reptiles, which could survive the harsh interior regions of Pangaea, became the dominant land animals of the late Permian.The therapsids flourished during the Permian, rapidly evolving many different forms, ranging from dinosaur-like fanged flesh-eaters to plodding herbivores. Some species reached a huge size, weighing in at over a ton. In the latter part of the Permian, smaller varieties emerged, likely warm-blooded and covered in insulating hair. From them, mammals would arise.The Permian seas came to be dominated by bony fishes with fan-shaped fins and thick, heavy scales. There were large reef communities that harbored squidlike nautiloids. Ammonoids, with their tightly coiled, spiral shells, are also widespread in the Permian fossil record.The Permian, however, represented the last gasp for much early prehistoric life. The period, and the Paleozoic era, came to a calamitous close 251 million years ago, marking a biological dividing line that few animals crossed. The Permian extinction—the worst extinction event in the planet's history—is estimated to have wiped out more than 90 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of land animals.Various theories seek to explain this mass extinction. Some scientists think a series of volcanic eruptions pumped so much debris into the atmosphere that the sun was blocked out, causing a significant drop in temperature and preventing plant photosynthesis, which in turn caused food chains to collapse.Other scientists point to global climate change, citing evidence for a period of sudden warming and cooling. These rapid extremes of conditions may have meant species were unable to adjust. Other theories include a catastrophic release of methane gas stored under the seabed, triggered by earthquakes or global warming, or a massive asteroid impact.Perhaps a combination of factors was to blame. But whatever the cause, new animals and plants would evolve to fill the void. Not least among them: the dinosaurs.",
"An artist's rendering shows hatchling nothosaurs heading for the safety of water as a hungry but terrestrial Ticinosuchus attacks near a lagoon in ancient Switzerland. Nothosaurs lived during the mid- and late Triassic period and were among the earliest reptiles to take to the sea. Because nothosaurs may have had to come ashore to lay eggs, the eggs and hatchlings would have been vulnerable to Ticinosuchus. Yet once the hatchlings reached deeper waters, they were safe—for the moment.The start of the Triassic period (and the Mesozoic era) was a desolate time in Earth's history. Something—a bout of violent volcanic eruptions, climate change, or perhaps a fatal run-in with a comet or asteroid—had triggered the extinction of more than 90 percent of Earth's species.But it was also a time of tremendous change and rejuvenation. Life that survived the so-called Great Dying repopulated the planet, diversified into freshly exposed ecological niches, and gave rise to new creatures, including rodent-size mammals and the first dinosaurs.By the start of the Triassic, all the Earth's landmasses had coalesced to form Pangaea, a supercontinent shaped like a giant C that straddled the Equator and extended toward the Poles. Almost as soon as the supercontinent formed, it started to come undone. By the end of the period 199 million years ago, tectonic forces had slowly begun to split the supercontinent in two: Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south.The giant ocean called Panthalassa surrounded Pangaea. Areas near the coast were pummeled by seasonal monsoons, but ocean-circulation patterns kept the isolated and vast interior warm and dry. Even the Poles were ice-free. The Tethys Ocean filled the C and was the zipper upon which Pangaea began to split apart. Earlier failed attempts at the split formed rift valleys in North America and Africa filled with red sediments that today contain the best preserved fossils of Triassic life.The oceans teemed with the coiled-shelled ammonites, mollusks, and sea urchins that survived the Permian extinction and were quickly diversifying. The first corals appeared, though other reef-building organisms were already present.Giant reptiles such as the dolphin-shaped ichthyosaurs and the long-necked and paddle-finned plesiosaurs preyed on fish and ancient squid. The bottom rung of the food chain was filled with microscopic plants called phytoplankton; two of the major groups still in the oceans today first appeared.Frogs, salamanders, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes slunk and slithered on and off the Triassic coast, lakes, and rivers. Pterosaurs, a group of flying reptiles, took to the air. On firm ground, moss, liverwort, and ferns carpeted forests of conifers, ginkgoes, and palm-like cycads. Spiders, scorpions, millipedes, and centipedes thrived. Grasshoppers appeared.But perhaps the biggest changes came with the evolution of dinosaurs and the first mammals in the late Triassic, starting around 230 million years ago.One of the earliest true mammals was the three-foot-long (one-meter-long) Eozostrodon. The shrewlike creature laid eggs but fed its young mother's milk. Among the first dinosaurs was the two-footed carnivore Coelophysis, which grew up to 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall, weighed up to a hundred pounds (45 kilograms), and probably fed on small reptiles and amphibians. It showed up about 225 million years ago. A few million years later came the 27.5-foot-long (8-meter-long) herbivore called Plateosaurus.The Triassic closed in the same way it began. Something—perhaps a volcanic belch or an asteroid collision—caused another mass extinction. Dinosaurs, however, survived and went on to dominate the Jurassic.",
"In an instant, the Chicxulub impact forever changed life on Earth—blasting out a huge crater, vaporizing and flinging up tons of rock, and devastating plant and animal life. Now, researchers have constructed a jaw-dropping timeline of the chaos by studying the rocks laid down inside the crater on that fateful day.Inch by inch, the team pulled up the skinny core of ghostly white limestone from the ocean floor, gazing at the compressed remains of ancient organisms that died tens of millions of years ago. But then a stark divide appeared as the layers abruptly darkened.“It was nothing like the stuff above,” recalls Sean Gulick, a co-chief scientist of the expedition and a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.This change in the rock marks one of the most catastrophic events in Earth’s history, some 66 million years ago, when an epic asteroid slammed into the sea just offshore of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The impact triggered a nightmarish sequence of events that sent some 75 percent of plant and animal species spiraling to extinction—including all the nonavian dinosaurs.Now, by subjecting the rocky core to a battery of tests, including geochemical study and x-ray imaging, the research team has assembled a meticulous timeline chronicling events on that fateful day—sometimes down to the minute. As they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the dark layers reveal stunning details, including the sheer amount of material that piled up mere hours after the strike, along with bits of charcoal later left by raging wildfires.“They can put their fingers on moments in that event,” says Jennifer Anderson, an experimental geologist who studies impact cratering at Winona State University. “The level of detail kind of blows you away.”While it’s unlikely another asteroid smashup of this magnitude will happen in our lifetimes, significant impacts are inevitable in the larger arc of our planet’s evolution, says Purdue University’s Jay Melosh, who is not part of the study team but who worked on other sections of the crater core. Studying these events helps us more strongly grasp the vulnerabilities of life on Earth, he says.“It’s not a matter of whether there will be big impacts,” he says, “it’s just a matter of when.”Previous studies have been slowly piecing together what happened after the so-called Chicxulub impact using a combination of computer models and the geologic fallout found at a smattering of sites around the world. One controversial locale in North Dakota may even capture an entire ecosystem catastrophically tossed by the seismic waves that rippled out from the impact zone.But the exact details of the chaos that ensued have been an enduring mystery, one that scientists hoped to solve by closely examining the impact crater itself. Layers of sediment had buried the crater over millennia, which prevented roaring winds and water from wearing it away, but also hid it out of reach of eager scientists. To actually touch this infamous moment in our planet’s history, researchers needed to drill.Comet C/2001 Q4, also known as NEAT, emits a blue-and-purple glow as it moves through the cosmos in May 2004. Its coma, or head, and a portion of its tail are visible in this shot, as are myriad stars. This image was taken by telescope from Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.Scientists started exploring the crater’s structure in 1996 via seismic surveys led by Joanna Morgan, who co-led the latest drilling efforts with Gulick. Along with a second expedition in 2005, that work confirmed the presence of what’s known as a peak ring—a circle of buried mountains that rapidly forms within the largest of impact craters. Such a structure is an ideal place to drill, Gulick says. Not only can it reveal the fundamental processes behind the formation of mega-craters, its elevation places it relatively close to the modern ocean floor, which means easier access.In the spring of 2016, the team at last sank metal teeth into the Chicxulub crater, and over the course of two months, they extracted sections of core 10 feet at a time. In total, they collected a slice of Earth about a half-mile long that captures the shocked rocks that were below the impact, layers of melted rock, and the transition back to normal seafloor sediments.“It was amazing to be on the ship and see those cores first coming up and realize we had some really exciting things to say,” Gulick marvels.The new study of that core sample combines the rocky record with computer models to create an unprecedented timeline of the geologic chaos on the day sparking the dinosaurs' demise.“To say that we’re looking at something that happened the day the impact happened 66 million years ago, that’s a kind of resolution that we almost never see in geology,” Anderson says.One of the most striking finds is the rate at which material was re-deposited after the impact. The asteroid strike excavated miles of ocean floor, vaporizing rock and water in a flash. A ripple of shockwaves inside the crater sent solid rock flowing like liquid to form a towering peak, which then collapsed outward to form the peak ring. Just tens of minutes later, a jumble of debris piled onto the peak ring in a layer some 130 feet thick. Some of this material came from a sheet of melted rock that splashed into place within minutes as the peak collapsed.Then, as the ocean rushed back into the yawning molten gap, pockets of steam burst forth, flinging up more fragments of rock. Within an hour, the crater was likely covered in a churning vat of rocky oceanic soup, periodically sloshed by the collapse of the crater’s steep wall.“Just like if you pour a bucket of water into a bathtub, it doesn’t sit quiet, it sloshes around,” Melosh explains. “Each slosh as it went back and forth deposited more material.”Rocky bits slowly settled out from the stew, piling up hundreds of feet of more debris. In total, the event laid down nearly 430 feet of new material in a single day.The team also found a notable lack of sulfur in the crater’s rocks. About a third of the rocks surrounding Chicxulub are sulfur-rich minerals known as evaporites, but these minerals are conspicuously absent from the core sample the team drilled.Instead, the impact seems to have vaporized the crater’s sulfur-bearing rocks, backing up past work that suggests the event released as much as 325 gigatons of sulfur. Yet the element’s near total absence hints that even this gargantuan number may be too low. This gas could have formed a haze of sulfuric acid that blotted out sunlight and triggered years of global cooling. Or, Melosh says, it might have created acid rain that abruptly acidified the oceans. Either way, the effects would have devastated life of all kinds.What’s more, the rock core offers clues to how the collision instantly affected life on land. Hurtling to Earth at some 45,000 miles an hour, the impact likely sent out a flash of energy that ignited landscapes within a 900 miles radius.“Mexico was on fire immediately,” Anderson says. The impact also flung geologic shrapnel high into the skies that plummeted back around the globe, igniting fires even farther from the impact zone. And in the top few inches of the core’s sediment, the scientists found bits of charcoal, likely created by those raging wildfires.Intriguingly, the researchers also found biomarkers from the fungal breakdown of wood, which further suggests that these burned bits came from a landscape set ablaze. The team thinks a mighty tsunami rippled across the Gulf of Mexico—and perhaps around the world—and that the watery wall bounced back after crossing the Mexican highlands, dragging with it charred terrestrial remains.There are still many more questions to answer about how the impact and its aftermath rippled around the world, says Kirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. But he praises the new work for providing such a stunningly preserved record of this terrifying day.“In a way, it’s telling us things that we thought we knew, but it’s telling it with the data that underpins it for the first time,” Johnson says.“I consider this to be an opening salvo,” adds the University of Washington’s Jody Bourgeois, who has studied the impact’s tsunami deposits in Texas and Mexico. Further study of the core samples and other evidence in the coming years will likely fill in many more details in the tumultuous tale.“It’s heady,” Gulick says of finally publishing the first few papers from the drilling project. “The discoveries keep coming.”",
"Layers of rock in the western U.S. known as the Hell Creek Formation preserve the final millennia of the age of dinosaurs. A nearby site in North Dakota called Tanis may hold sediments laid down within minutes to hours of the asteroid impact that set off this mass extinction 66 million years ago.Mere minutes after a miles-wide asteroid slammed into Earth 66 million years ago, a hailstorm of tiny glass beads rained down on a flooding estuary in what's now North Dakota. As seismic waves from the impact thrashed the water, plants and animals were jumbled up and buried in the shifting sediments, which preserved the aftermath for millennia.Now, researchers say this site—newly described in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences—represents an exceedingly rare snapshot of the moment that marked the dinosaurs' demise. Handfuls of fossils have been found before at other places that also capture this moment in the geologic record, known as the K-Pg boundary. But the North Dakota site potentially represents an entire ecosystem affected by the catastrophe.Study leader Robert DePalma conducts field research at the Tanis site.“Essentially, what we've got there is the geologic equivalent of high-speed film of the very first moments after the impact,” says lead study author Robert DePalma, a Ph.D. student at the University of Kansas and a curator at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History.“To see organisms that would have been impacted by the actual event at the end of the Cretaceous is just stunning,” adds coauthor Philip Manning, a paleontologist at the University of Manchester. (See why some scientists think that volcanoes helped doom the dinosaurs.)On Friday, The New Yorker published a feature describing the site—sometimes in more detail than the study itself provides. According to DePalma, the new PNAS paper will be just the first of several scientific studies that will fill in the details of this remarkable find.So, what does the published data actually reveal so far? And what else might the site hold for paleontologists? We've got you covered.The North Dakota site, nicknamed Tanis after the “lost” ancient Egyptian city, lies on private ranch land within a tiny outcrop of the larger Hell Creek Formation, a series of rock layers that record the hundreds of millennia leading up to the dinosaurs' extinction.Study coauthor Mark Richards (left, background) watches as team leader Robert DePalma examines impact ejecta under a microscope during an expedition at Tanis.DePalma first learned of the site from a fossil-dealer acquaintance, who had prospected there and found little he could sell for high value. Based on the fish, the dealer thought the site was a pond deposit that formed many thousands of years before the K-Pg boundary. But the more that DePalma mapped the site, the more he reconsidered. What if the site was in fact the low-lying portion of a river valley?As described in the paper, DePalma found telltale signs of the K-Pg impact in the site's sediments, including bits of quartz shocked under the impact's immense pressure, as well as plenty of impact debris.After the asteroid struck, it tore a gaping hole in Earth's crust some 50 miles wide and 18 miles deep, sending hunks of molten earth splashing upward and outward with ferocious speed. High in the atmosphere, the debris coalesced into tiny glass blobs, many of them less than a millimeter wide. These particles, called tektites, started raining down about 15 minutes after impact in a torrent of glass that didn't let up for another three quarters of an hour.The Tanis deposits contain a well-preserved mass of intertangled fish that retain their three-dimensional forms.In many K-Pg sites, the tektites formed a discrete layer—but not at Tanis. The site's many layers of sediments are chock-full of tektites, which researchers interpret as a sign of water sloshing back and forth as the tektites fell. Tree resin at the site managed to catch some tektites before becoming fossilized as amber. DePalma's team even claims to have a tektite buried within the two-inch-deep hole it punched into sediment once it landed. After being flung onto land, a mass of fish became entombed all at once, and their exquisitely preserved bodies include gills congested with impact debris.“It essentially stockpiled the rarest and most poorly represented things in [the rock formation] in one deposit that we can study for decades—and that’s without even including the impact scenario,” DePalma says. (Here's why some experts think the asteroid hit just the right spot to cause the mass extinction.)“I certainly was approaching it from a place of skepticism, but to be honest, having read through the paper, I’d be personally hard-pressed to come up with an alternate explanation,” says Victoria Arbour, paleontology curator at the Royal BC Museum who was not involved with the study.Ken Lacovara, a paleontologist at Rowan University who was also not on the study team, points out that more than 350 sites around the world preserve the K-Pg boundary, and some of these sites also bear fossils. In 1987, paleontologists described shark teeth and clam shells at a K-Pg site in central Poland. In 2013, researchers in Denmark found isolated shark teeth within the clays laid down by the impact's fallout. But Manning and other researchers who have seen the fossils up close stress that Tanis stands alone.“It's just mind-boggling,” says Florida State University paleobiologist Greg Erickson, who is not on the team but saw the fish fossils firsthand when visiting DePalma's lab several weeks ago. “I've never seen anything like that, and there's stacks of these things!”Though DePalma and his colleagues interpret the site as an estuary in a river valley, there are signs of creatures at Tanis that normally lived out at sea. The study documents some fragmentary marine fossils, including the teeth of ancient sharks, aquatic reptiles called mosasaurs, and an extinct type of mollusk called an ammonite. DePalma and his teams interpret the mix of land and ocean animals as a sign that water from an inland sea suddenly washed upriver, spilling its guts onto the riverbanks at Tanis. (See other evidence for a mass shark extinction in the wake of the asteroid strike.)A cross-section of the Tanis deposit shows the layered stratigraphy from two surge pulses and some animal fossils.“The presence of the ammonite there is very weird ... it's like putting a squid in the Upper Potomac,” says Kirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and an expert on the Hell Creek Formation. Johnson adds that if the mosasaur tooth is confirmed to be the same age as the rest of the site, it could represent the youngest mosasaur material ever found.The site's sediments also suggest that a sudden rush of water overtook it. Researchers initially thought the deluge was the impact's tsunami racing up the Western Interior Seaway, a dinosaur-era body of water that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to northwest North America. But the timing was off: It would have taken eight to 16 hours for the tsunami to reach Tanis, but the site's sloshing must have occurred within the first hour after impact.Instead, the team thinks that the floods were seiche waves, pulses of flooding caused by magnitude 10 to 11 earthquakes triggered by the impact. Much like the footfalls of T. rex shook every glass of water in the film Jurassic Park, the asteroid impact would have generated such waves that would have sloshed bodies of water around the world.So far, many geologists and paleontologists have welcomed the study's insights into the asteroid impact.“The beauty of the study—and it is a beautiful piece of work—is that it is what you expect: Giant rock hits Earth, stuff happens,” says Paul Renne, a geochronologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the detailed timing at the end of the Cretaceous.However, nearly every paleontologist contacted by National Geographic who is not on the study team raised some concerns about the rollout of the discovery, going back to when DePalma presented previews at conferences in 2013 and 2016. Some researchers were so shocked by his claims at the time, they wondered whether the site was too good to be true.Some of DePalma's early work has also raised eyebrows, including one high-profile error. In 2015, DePalma unveiled a new species of dinosaur called Dakotaraptor, but a 2016 study led by Arbour revealed that DePalma had accidentally included fossil turtle bones in Dakotaraptor's reconstructed skeleton. Still, DePalma's colleagues vigorously defend his work on Tanis.“There’s not one person out there that hasn’t dropped the ball at some point,” Manning says. “He has produced a remarkable study.”Concerns also linger about the lack of visibility. The New Yorker story published days before the underlying scientific study and its 69-page supplement were set to formally appear online. National Geographic obtained both documents and distributed them to outside researchers for comment.According to the New Yorker, Tanis abounds with fossils, including teeth, bones, and hatchling remains of almost every dinosaur group known from the Hell Creek Formation. The story also reports the presence of foot-long feathers possibly from dinosaurs, pterosaur remains, and an unhatched egg of some kind with a preserved embryo inside.None of these details are in the study, however. No dinosaur bones are mentioned in the main study, and the supplement highlights only one hip-bone fragment from a horned dinosaur like Triceratops, found with “associated impressions of tissue.” (The New Yorker claims that a suitcase-size piece of fossilized skin is attached to the bone fragment.)“The weird thing is, DePalma has been very hyperbolic and cryptic for the last six years,” says the Smithsonian's Johnson, who was also interviewed for the New Yorker story. “The paper is fine, and we can talk about its significance, [but we] have it paired with the New Yorker article, which has a lot more nuanced detail and a lot more claims. It just makes us all a little bit queasy.”Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh and a National Geographic grantee, also expresses some consternation: “Right now, I am left with more questions than answers ... It seems odd.”Study leader Robert DePalma (right) and field assistant Kylie Ruble stabilize a fossil slab with plaster bandages before removing it from the ground.To verify the study's claims, paleontologists say that DePalma must broaden access to the site and its material.“It’s the case where extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence; the jury should be out until other people look at this,” says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley.“If I were in [DePalma's] situation, I would need to put on my science armor and get ready for a lot of criticism—and I think that that’s OK,” adds Arbour. “The nature of science should be for people to come at this with lots of different perspectives and lots of different approaches.”DePalma says that the new study is supposed to be a geological introduction to Tanis, not a full description, and that the team is working on follow-up publications. Also, the excavated fossils are entering museum collections, making them available for wider study. The horned-dinosaur bone, for instance, now resides at Florida Atlantic University.The researchers add that there are early discussions with the ranch owner on how best to protect Tanis for posterity. In the meantime, the site continues to reveal its secrets.“Virtually every day they dig there, they see something they haven't seen before,” says study coauthor Mark Richards, a geophysicist formerly at the University of California, Berkeley, now at the University of Washington, who visited the site in 2017. “You can go for days or months at a paleontology dig site and not find anything interesting, and [DePalma] finds things literally by the hour. It's unbelievable.”",
"Reconstruction of a floodplain in North America from about 66 million years ago, where dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex, Edmontosaurus, and Triceratops roamed.One day 66 million years ago, life came to a sudden, apocalyptic halt when an asteroid impact violently closed the book on the age of dinosaurs. Birds are the only members of the dino family tree that survived the ordeal, and the open niches left behind gave them and our early mammal ancestors their time in the ecological spotlight.But what if calamity hadn't befallen the dinosaurs? Would they still have gone out not with a bang, but a whimper?Maybe not, according to a new study that says dinosaurs still had plenty of vim and vigor leading up to the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. Revealed using huge simulations that are new to paleontology, the finding marks the latest turn in a debate over whether dinosaurs were already in “terminal decline” by the time doomsday struck.In addition, the study's cutting-edge approach could help us better look back at past environmental turmoil and learn in finer detail what we might expect from modern climate change.“The results are very important—the whole story of decline and contradicting that—but it's also good that we've been devising and applying new methods. It's this multi-angled thing,” says paleontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a Ph.D. student at Imperial College London who led the new study, published today in Nature Communications.Watch the 1940 Disney movie Fantasia, and you'll get a look at how paleontologists once thought the dinosaurs died out. In the film, familiar species flourish in lush swampland but eventually succumb to a more hellish climate. That vision changed in the 1980s, when Walter and Luis Alvarez argued that dinosaurs didn't simply march across a desert to their deaths; instead, a combination of geologic and fossil evidence suggested that their reign ended with a cataclysmic asteroid strike.Years later, scientists found the smoking gun: the remnants of the resulting crater off the coast of Mexico. Ever since, most paleontologists have agreed that the asteroid bears the bulk of the blame for the dinosaurs' demise. (But even that's up for debate: Two recent studies build on the case that volcanoes also helped kill the dinosaurs.)That said, paleontologists debate what would have happened if the asteroid had never crashed into Earth. Getting hard numbers on this question is challenging because of the fossil record's fragmentary nature. Environmental conditions must be just right for an organism's body to end up buried and isolated long enough to form a fossil. As a result, telling life's history with fossils is like reconstructing the plot of an epic when all you have are tatters of the only surviving transcription. What if the pages fall apart, or the ink fades?When tallying up the number of ancient species, paleontologists must therefore account for biases in the fossil record. And when you look at raw tallies, it looks like the number of dinosaur species declined in western North America in the last 17 million years of the Cretaceous. That suggests the dinosaurs were already in their twilight years when the asteroid struck.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.But the time period closer to the mass extinction, what's called the Maastrichtian epoch, has not yielded enough fossils to show the finer details. Many studies have tried to account for this bias, and when they do, they find that dinosaur diversity in western North America holds steady or was even increasing until the last gasp. In this scenario, dinosaurs were doing fine—until they suddenly weren't.This emerging consensus suffered a blow in 2016, when University of Reading biologist Manabu Sakamoto published a paper claiming that, tens of millions of years before the extinction, dinosaur species were dying out faster than new ones were emerging. According to this picture, based on a global family tree of dinosaurs, the heyday for some dinosaur groups had passed well before asteroid-induced armageddon.Sakamoto's study isn't directly comparable to others, as it looks at longer timescales. Nevertheless, his work once again stoked the flames of debate.To tackle big questions, it helps to have big databases, and for decades, paleontologists have been assembling huge public databases of fossil occurrences. Now, a new generation of computer-savvy paleontologists can slice and dice the ancient world like never before, gaining new insights on a global scale.“We’re at an age of big data and data science now, right?” Sakamoto says. “If you want to make these grandiose kinds of studies and claims, you do need really big data to back it up, so the databases are vital.”If you're picturing database-driven paleontology as a mix of Jurassic Park and The Matrix, you'd be sorely mistaken. It's tedious work carefully vetting and re-vetting databases that can house hundreds of thousands of entries.“We spend years on this kind of stuff—it's day in and day out of failed models, failed runs, data cleaning, and if I see a misspelling of 'Maastrichtian' another time, I'll go crazy,” says paleontologist Emma Dunne, a Ph.D. student at the University of Birmingham who uses climate models to study dinosaurs' evolutionary origins. “But it's so worth it. It's super-exciting.”Chiarenza's journey followed a similar path. He just wanted to study dinosaurs, but to answer his questions, he had to learn subjects ranging from Earth systems models to cutting-edge ecology.For the new study, he first combined high-resolution models of ancient Earth's terrain with state-of-the-art climate models, the same kind that scientists use to understand human influence on today's climate. He and his colleagues then plotted where dinosaur fossils had been found across this ancient terrain, focusing on three groups: tyrannosaurs, ceratopsians such as Triceratops, and “duck-billed” hadrosaurs.The researchers trained algorithms on the massive dataset to associate a given group of dinosaurs with a type of topography and climate. With these habitat models in hand, Chiarenza's team could zoom out to all of North America and project which regions were theoretically suitable for dinosaurs. Their model shows that toward the end of the Cretaceous, much of North America would have still been dino-friendly.At the same time, the researchers modeled where in this region dinosaur fossils were most likely able to form. They simulated the flow of sediments off the baby Rocky Mountains into a seaway that once covered parts of western North America. As the Cretaceous ended, this seaway shrank—and so did the volume of sediments needed to preserve fossils.Based on their results, Chiarenza and his colleagues argue that the apparent dino decline in western North America isn't a result of evolution cutting dinosaurs from the story; instead, it's geology being a sloppy scribe.Though debate is sure to continue, Chiarenza's work falls in line with other studies that also fail to show a long-term dino decline. In 2018, a study led by Ph.D. student Klara Nordén found that based on their teeth, plant-eating dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous were as ecologically diverse as ever.“It fits really nicely with what we already know from other lines of evidence,” she says.And since Chiarenza's models simulate dinosaurs' response to climate, his work could let researchers tease out what exactly killed them; scientists could throw a simulated asteroid or mega-volcano at the model and see the effects on habitat. Chiarenza is currently working through this very question. Similarly, researchers could use the model to dive into other past instances of climate variation to see how habitats respond and what may be happening today with ongoing climate change.“This kind of technique could be very valuable for [giving] a baseline for how we understand changes that we might be facing with anthropogenic global warming,” says Paul Barrett, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the study.Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, adds that the study very clearly implicates the asteroid as the reason the dinosaurs died out. But he also notes that the study hints at what could have been if not for the sudden catastrophe.  “The most touching part of the paper [is that] it’s really clear that there was still plenty of potential niches for the dinosaurs—but the dinosaurs just weren't there, because the asteroid killed them off,” he says. “You kind of get this sad sense of the dinosaurs that could have been.”",
"Tyrannosaurus rex arose during the Cretaceous period about 85 million years ago, and thrived as a top land predator until the dinosaurs went extinct 20 million years later. This skeleton, on display in Chicago's Field Museum, is a cast of perhaps the world's most famous fossil: "Sue," a 67-million-year-old T. rex discovered in 1990 in South Dakota by field paleontologist Sue Hendrickson. It is the most complete, best preserved, and, at 42 feet (12.8 meters), the largest T. rex specimen ever found.Continents were on the move in the Cretaceous, busy remodeling the shape and tone of life on Earth. At the start of the period, dinosaurs ruled the loosening remnants of the supercontinent Pangaea as rodents scurried at their feet through forests of ferns, cycads, and conifers. At the end of the period, about 80 million years later, oceans filled yawning gaps between isolated continents shaped much as they are today. Flowering plants were spreading across the landscape. And mammals sat poised to fill the void that soon would be left by the vanished dinosaurs. A giant crater smoldered on what would become known as the Yucatán Peninsula.Whether or not the asteroid or comet that carved the Chicxulub crater caused the extinction of more than half the planet's species at the end of the Cretaceous remains a matter of scientific debate. But the shifted continents, expanded coasts, and widened oceans had cooled and moistened the planet's climate and set in motion dramatic changes to the flora and fauna. An extraterrestrial impact or a bout of volcanism from within was perhaps too much for many of Earth's species to handle.Long before the carnage began, the Cretaceous picked up where the Jurassic left off: Gigantic sauropods led parades of dinosaurs through the forests, over the plains, and along the coasts; long-necked and toothy marine reptiles terrorized fish, ammonites, and mollusks in the seas; pterosaurs and hairy-feathered birds filled the skies. But as the continents spread, the ocean currents churned with ever more vigor. After a temperature spike in the mid-Cretaceous, the climate began to cool, and the tenor changed.Though dinosaurs ruled throughout the Cretaceous, the dominant groups shifted and many new types evolved. Sauropods dominated the southern continents but became rare in the north. Herd-dwelling ornithischians like Iguanodon spread everywhere but Antarctica. Toward the close of the Cretaceous, vast herds of horned beasts such as Triceratops munched cycads and other low-lying plants on the northern continents. The carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex dominated the late Cretaceous in the north while monstrous meat-eaters like Spinosaurus, which had a huge sail-like fin on its back, thrived in the south. Smaller carnivores likely battled for the scraps.Other creatures, such as frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodiles, and snakes, proliferated on the expanded coasts. Shrewlike mammals scurried about the forests. The largest pterosaur known soared overhead though the group as a whole faced ever stiffening competition from fast diversifying birds: Ancestors to modern grebes, cormorants, pelicans, and sandpipers all show up in the Cretaceous.In the warm, shallow seas that spilled onto the continents, the long-necked plesiosaurs gave way to the giant, snakelike mosasaurs. Rays and modern sharks became common. Sea urchins and sea stars (starfish) thrived; coral reefs continued to grow. Diatoms, a type of shelled plankton, made their first radiation into the ocean.But it was the rapid dispersal of flowering plants that stole the show—a spread enhanced with the help of insects from bees and wasps to ants and beetles. Magnolia, ficus, and sassafras quickly outnumbered ferns, conifers, gingkoes, and cycads.Much of this rich life—including all dinosaurs, pterosaurs, pliosaurs, and ammonites—perished in the extinction event at the end of the period 65 million years ago. In fact, the land, seas, and skies would never be the same in the new era that dawned after the close of the Mesozoic era.",
"Mist-shrouded Mongolian Saurolophus gather at dawn, as seen in a painting. Non-avian dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago in a cataclysm probably driven by a large asteroid impact. Now, two studies help to clarify how huge volcanoes erupting at the same time could have also played a role.Ask someone how the dinosaurs died, and chances are they will tell you about an apocalyptically bad day 66 million years ago, when a huge asteroid slammed into Earth and triggered a nuclear winter. This event left behind distinct traces in the geologic record, as well as a vast crater off Mexico's Yucatán peninsula called Chicxulub. But since the 1980s, researchers have debated whether volcanoes in ancient India may have been an accessory to the mass extinction—or even its main driver.Now, two independent research teams have created the best time lines of this volcanic activity ever assembled. Despite using different dating methods, their two studies—published on Thursday in the journal Science—agree in broad strokes on the timing of the ancient eruptions, helping clarify how they could have played a supporting role in wiping out non-avian dinosaurs. (Meet the dinosaurs that didn't die.)“We agree more than we disagree, and that's a really important conclusion,” says Courtney Sprain, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Liverpool who led one of the studies, working with a team from the University of California, Berkeley.According to the two teams, the massive volcanoes, called the Deccan Traps, started erupting about 400,000 years before the Chicxulub impact and wrapped up about 600,000 years after the end of the Cretaceous period. At least half of the volcanoes' total erupted lava spilled out after the impact.“That's a big improvement over 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, where [the two teams' dating methods] couldn't agree to better than a few percent, which here would be millions of years,” says Princeton geochronologist Blair Schoene, who led the other study. “The level of agreement between the studies is pretty remarkable.”However, the studies disagree on the eruptions' finer timing and tempo, which are crucial when assigning relative blame for the extinctions. One study claims that the Deccan Traps saw a major eruptive uptick in the hundred thousand years leading up to the impact, potentially stressing out some ecosystems before the asteroid's decisive blow. The other study, however, finds that most of volcanoes' lava erupted after the impact had occurred, implying a smaller role.The Deccan Traps were incomprehensibly huge by modern standards, expelling some 135,000 cubic miles of lava over a million-year period. That's enough lava to circle Earth with a rocky belt more than five miles wide and a mile tall. By contrast, the 2018 eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano spewed about a fifth of a cubic mile of lava over a couple months.These mountains in India's Western Ghats region are made of many layers of lava flows from the Deccan Traps' eruptions, interspersed with ash-rich sedimentary beds called redboles.These sorts of mega-volcanoes are suspects in other mass extinctions. Most infamously, huge volcanoes in what is now Siberia probably played a key role in Earth's deadliest mass extinction at the Permian-Triassic boundary about 252 million years ago. But how, exactly, the Deccan Traps contributed to the dinosaurs' demise depends on timing. (Here are some of the weirder theories once proposed for what killed the dinosaurs.)That's why the Berkeley and Princeton teams independently traveled to the Western Ghats, the region in India where the Deccan Traps once roared. The region's dramatic, banded valleys are carved from the leftovers of these immense volcanoes. In some places, the rock layers formed from cooled lava are more than a mile thick.“As someone who loves looking at rock, it's one of the few places you can go where everything you look at is the same thing and caused by the same event,” Sprain says. “It's just a really cool place to be.”Sprain's team dated when minerals in the lava cooled below a few hundred degrees Fahrenheit, which told them directly when the lavas erupted and cooled. By contrast, Schoene's team dated crystals called zircons found in the sediments sandwiched between lava layers. These crystals formed in distant volcanoes and arrived in wind-borne ash. Based on the spread of zircon ages within a given sediment layer, Schoene's team could precisely estimate when the lava above it was laid down.Despite agreeing on the big picture, the two time lines differ in the details. Schoene's team found signs of four distinct pulses of eruptions at the Deccan Traps, with the biggest coming about a hundred thousand years before the impact. That's suggestive of a larger role for the volcanoes in the extinction: The eruptions could have injected massive amounts of greenhouse gases and particles into the atmosphere, changing Earth's climate in ways that stressed out late Cretaceous life. Then, in a one-two punch, the impact's nuclear winter would have sharply cooled Earth and caused ecosystems to collapse.However, Sprain's team doesn't see pulses, and they find that a full 75 percent of the Deccan lava erupted after the impact. This suggests that the Deccan Traps' lava couldn't have played a decisive role in the extinction event itself—and judging by life's rapid bounce back from the mass extinction, the eruptions didn't seriously hamper recovery, either. Instead, the smaller pre-impact eruptions may have been extremely gassy, causing the warming and cooling observed in the 300,000 years before the impact.Sprain's data even suggest that the impact may have caused the Deccan Traps' larger, post-impact eruptions. Sprain and UC Berkeley geochronologist Paul Renne, one of her coauthors, have raised this idea in previous studies.In large part, the two studies' differences stem from how hard it is to reconstruct Earth's past. Technology has improved to the point at which scientists can date the formation of certain rocks to within tens of thousands of years. In the long view, that's very precise: If Earth's 4.54-billion-year history were compressed onto a calendar year, we now can time geologic events down to a few minutes. And the teams that authored the new studies are considered the best at rock dating in the world.This nearly whole, deep-black skull belongs to the most complete specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex on display in Europe, an individual nicknamed Tristan Otto. With 170 of its 300-odd bones preserved, this scientifically important but privately owned skeleton is currently at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Discovered in 2010 in Montana’s famed Hell Creek Formation of the late Cretaceous, the 40-foot-long fossil took four years to excavate and prepare.“It's kind of a neat commentary on the progress of science,” says U.S. Geological Survey geochronologist Seth Burgess, who wrote about both studies in an accompanying article in Science. “With better techniques and more fieldwork, we're able to look much more closely of what happened when, and what was a more simple story has gotten more complex.”The problem is that the Chicxulub impact was literally over in a day, so when trying to date the rocks that formed directly before or after, the sequence of events can remain stubbornly fuzzy. Case in point: the Poladpur Formation, a key layer of Deccan Traps lava that both teams examined. Sprain's data allow for the Poladpur to have formed alongside or after the impact. But Schoene's models suggest that the Poladpur formed in the hundred thousand years before the impact.Whether the Poladpur lava flowed before or after the impact matters quite a bit. The formation consists of 35,000 cubic miles of lava, about a quarter of the total Deccan Traps volume. Did the Poladpur help prime Earth for death, or did it come after the fact?“I find it difficult to know how we'll ever stop arguing about it,” says University of Leeds paleontologist Paul Wignall, who wasn't involved with either study. “As the timing has improved, in a way it's just almost worse, because it shows that the coincidence of the volcanism and the impact are very close—almost beyond resolution, really.”Still, the researchers are already talking about how to put their competing ideas to the test. Schoene's analysis, for instance, predicts that the Deccan Traps went relatively quiet for up to 300,000 years, plenty of time for cooled lava on the surface to erode. If Schoene's team is right, then signs of this ancient weathering should be buried within the Deccan Traps' layers.Along the way, both universities' teams remain committed to working together—a sign of unity after decades of disagreement. Berkeley was home to Luis and Walter Alvarez, the father-son team that famously advocated for the asteroid-impact model. Princeton, meanwhile, is home to Gerta Keller, a coauthor on Schoene's paper who has argued for decades that the Deccan Traps alone caused the dinosaurs' demise.“We're getting closer to an answer we hope that all groups agree on,” Sprain says.",
"The Tungurahua volcano erupts in the night. Tungurahua, also called the Black Giant, is one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes.Volcanoes are Earth's geologic architects. They've created more than 80 percent of our planet's surface, laying the foundation that has allowed life to thrive. Their explosive force crafts mountains as well as craters. Lava rivers spread into bleak landscapes. But as time ticks by, the elements break down these volcanic rocks, liberating nutrients from their stony prisons and creating remarkably fertile soils that have allowed civilizations to flourish.There are volcanoes on every continent, even Antarctica. Some 1,500 volcanoes are still considered potentially active around the world today; 161 of those—over 10 percent—sit within the boundaries of the United States.But each volcano is different. Some burst to life in explosive eruptions, like the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and others burp rivers of lava in what's known as an effusive eruption, like the 2018 activity of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano. These differences are all thanks to the chemistry driving the molten activity. Effusive eruptions are more common when the magma is less viscous, or runny, which allows gas to escape and the magma to flow down the volcano's slopes. Explosive eruptions, however, happen when viscous molten rock traps the gasses, building pressure until it violently breaks free.The majority of volcanoes in the world form along the boundaries of Earth's tectonic plates—massive expanses of our planet's lithosphere that continually shift, bumping into one another. When tectonic plates collide, one often plunges deep below the other in what's known as a subduction zone.As the descending landmass sinks deep into the Earth, temperatures and pressures climb, releasing water from the rocks. The water slightly reduces the melting point of the overlying rock, forming magma that can work its way to the surface—the spark of life to reawaken a slumbering volcano.Not all volcanoes are related to subduction, however. Another way volcanoes can form is what's known as hotspot volcanism. In this situation, a zone of magmatic activity—or a hotspot—in the middle of a tectonic plate can push up through the crust to form a volcano. Although the hotspot itself is thought to be largely stationary, the tectonic plates continue their slow march, building a line of volcanoes or islands on the surface. This mechanism is thought to be behind the Hawaii volcanic chain.Some 75 percent of the world's active volcanoes are positioned around the ring of fire, a 25,000-mile long, horseshoe-shaped zone that stretches from the southern tip of South America across the West Coast of North America, through the Bering Sea to Japan, and on to New Zealand.This region is where the edges of the Pacific and Nazca plates butt up against an array of other tectonic plates. Importantly, however, the volcanoes of the ring aren't geologically connected. In other words, a volcanic eruption in Indonesia is not related to one in Alaska, and it could not stir the infamous Yellowstone supervolcano.Volcanic eruptions pose many dangers aside from lava flows. It's important to heed local authorities' advice during active eruptions and evacuate regions when necessary.One particular danger is pyroclastic flows, avalanches of hot rocks, ash, and toxic gas that race down slopes at speeds as high as 450 miles an hour. Such an event was responsible for wiping out the people of Pompeii and Herculaneum after Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.Similarly, volcanic mudflows called lahars can be very destructive. These fast-flowing waves of mud and debris can race down a volcano's flanks, burying entire towns.Ash is another volcanic danger. Unlike the soft, fluffy bits of charred wood left after a campfire, volcanic ash is made of sharp fragments of rocks and volcanic glass each less than two millimeters across. The ash forms as the gasses within rising magma expand, shattering the cooling rocks as they burst from the volcano's mouth. It's not only dangerous to inhale, it's heavy and builds up quickly. Volcanic ash can collapse weak structures, cause power outages, and is a challenge to shovel away post-eruption.Volcanoes give some warning of pending eruption, making it vital for scientists to closely monitor any volcanoes near large population centers. Warning signs include small earthquakes, swelling or bulging of the volcano's sides, and increased emission of gasses from its vents. None of those signs necessarily mean an eruption is imminent, but they can help scientists evaluate the state of the volcano when magma is building.However, it's impossible to say exactly when, or even if, any given volcano will erupt. Volcanoes don't run on a timetable like a train. This means it's impossible for one to be “overdue” for eruption—no matter what news headlines say.The deadliest eruption in recorded history was the 1815 explosion of Mount Tabora in Indonesia. The blast was one of the most powerful ever documented and created a caldera—essentially a crater—4 miles across and more than 3,600 feet deep. A superheated plume of hot ash and gas shot 28 miles into the sky, producing numerous pyroclastic flows when it collapsed.The eruption and its immediate dangers killed around 10,000 people. But that wasn't its only impact. The volcanic ash and gas injected into the atmosphere obscured the sun and increased the reflectivity of Earth, cooling its surface and causing what's known as the year without a summer. Starvation and disease during this time killed some 82,000 more people, and the gloomy conditions are often credited as the inspiration for gothic horror tales, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.Although there have been several big eruptions in recorded history, volcanic eruptions today are no more frequent than there were a decade or even a century ago. At least a dozen volcanoes erupt on any given day. As monitoring capacity for—and interest in—volcanic eruptions increases, coverage of the activity more frequently appears in the news and on social media. As Erik Klemetti, associate professor of geosciences at Denison University, writes in The Washington Post: “The world is not more volcanically active, we’re just more volcanically aware.”",
"Steam rises as lava pours into the Pacific Ocean on the Big Island of Hawaii.Without volcanoes, there would be no Hawaii. The eight primary islands that make up this archipelago owe their existence to a roiling spot of magma deep under the ocean floor known as the Hawaii hotspot.The hotspot is thought to lurk for now below the archipelago's youngest and most active landmass, the Big Island of Hawaii. Its molten rock fuels the eruption of this island's four active volcanoes: Mauna Loa, Kīlauea, Hualālai, and the offshore underwater volcano Lōihi.While the hotspot itself remains largely stationary, the overriding Pacific plate does not; it creeps northwest at a rate of three to four inches each year. Because of this, the volcanic activity on the planet's surface also shifts. That movement formed the series of islands, which are progressively older as you go westward. On the more ancient landmasses, the volcanoes are no longer active because they have been cut off from the hotspot's supply of magma.Volcanoes born from this activity actually extend much further than we can see. The Hawaiian archipelago is merely the latest, largely above-water result of volcanism that began some 70 million years ago. It's part of a massive mountain range known as the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamounts chain, which stretches some 3,700 miles and nearly reaches the coast of Alaska.Most volcanoes form near the edges of Earth's tectonic plates, the ever-shifting puzzle pieces that make up the planet's surface. But the Hawaiian volcanic chain resides far from any plate edges. In 1963, Canadian geophysicist John Tuzo-Wilson proposed that tectonic plate movement over a hotspot could explain these volcanic enigmas.In the years since, additional research has refined and added detail to that early notion. One particularly curious feature is that there's a sharp turn in the middle of the Hawaiian Ridge-Emperor Seamounts chain. While its origins have been debated, it likely reflects a shift in the motion of the Pacific plate.Many more questions remain unanswered: Where do Hawaii's hotspot plumes come from? How long do they usually stick around? How does magma split between the Big Island's currently active volcanoes? With continued research, scientists hope to dig through these and other lingering mysteries.Standing some 13,100 feet above sea level and encompassing more than 2,000 square miles, Mauna Loa bears the title of the second largest active volcano in the world. It last erupted in 1984, spouting lava down its eastern flank for 22 days.But it was Hawaii's Kīlauea volcano that made global headlines in May 2018 as it embarked on a months-long eruption—the latest leg of a lengthy burst of activity that started in 1983. At times during the eruption, the lava spewed more than a hundred feet in the air and flowed like water, forming deadly rivers that inundated local communities and cost millions of dollars in damages and lost tourism.The eruption also reshaped the island, forming a new black sand beach and even a short-lived baby island off its coast. The fiery rampage earned Kīlauea the top slot in the the U.S. Geological Survey's 2018 rankings of the most dangerous volcanoes in the U.S.Many of the geologic beasts of the island chain have remained silent for thousands of years or more as the masses drifted further from the hotspot's font of magma. Take, for example, the geologically oldest—and now inactive—island of Kauai, which formed roughly five million years ago.While eruptions can be destructive, plowing over houses and roasting plant life, each new flow is also productive. Layer upon layer of dark volcanic rock helps each island grow upward and outward, crafting the growing landmass's sweeping mountains, beaches, and cliffs.Lava from five volcanoes laid the foundations of the Big Island of Hawaii; submarine volcanoes also likely contributed to building its base. Over time, rain and wind break the rocks down, releasing a rich array of nutrients that feed the famous tropical ecosystem.",
"Molten rock poured like water from Hawaii's Kīlauea volcano this summer, destroying hundreds of homes.In the wake of its recent fiery rampage, it's perhaps no surprise that Kīlauea in Hawaii tops the list as the most dangerous volcano in the U.S., according to newly released rankings from the U.S. Geological Survey. Washington's Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier round out the top three slots.The new volcano threat assessment is an update to a 2005 report that determined the greatest risks based on the potential for eruption and human impacts. To be clear, the report does not forecast the volcanoes most likely to erupt—it is merely a ranking of the “potential severity of impacts” of future hypothetical eruptions.“The threat articulated in this report is the same threat that was there a week ago,” says Ben Andrews, the director of the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program. “It's maybe just a little better described here.”Such rankings provide vital information so that the USGS and other organizations can determine which volcanoes deserve the most attention for research, monitoring, emergency planning, and funding. By doing so, these groups can more effectively help local communities react to future eruptions.“It's so critical,” volcanologist Janine Krippner of Concord University says of the report. Volcanology funding is limited, she notes, so the ranking helps scientists and government officials home in on the biggest dangers and try to avert disaster.“Volcanoes tend to give us warning before they erupt,” Krippner says. “But if we're not listening, we'll miss it.”The United States is one of the most volcanic countries in the world, boasting more than 10 percent of the planet's active or potentially active volcanoes. The latest report identifies 161 volcanoes of concern, the majority of which cluster along the nation's western coast through California, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.Mount Semeru, seen with an ash plume, is the highest volcano on the  Indonesian island of Java and has been in a constant eruption since  1967.  It lies at the southern end of the Tengger caldera, which  contains smaller volcanoes Mount Bromo and Mount Batok (both seen in  the foreground), and several others.This intense activity is driven by the underlying collision of tectonic plates, where the denser oceanic plate is being shoved beneath the North American continental plate. As the ocean slab plunges deep into the planet, temperatures and pressures climb, causing water to escape. The presence of water reduces the melting point of the rocks overhead, forming magma. If that molten material makes it to the surface, a formerly quiescent peak can burst to life in an eruption. (Here's what may happen when Earth's plate tectonics stop.)But the West Coast isn't the only place in the country with potential for volcanic activity. Though they're placed at a much lower threat level, volcanoes in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah also make the list.“The reason why they are there is much debated,” Adam Kent, a volcanologist at Oregon State University, says of these interior volcanoes. They could be powered by hotspots, where an underlying plume of magma lurks. This is the mechanism behind the Hawaiian island chain, which formed as its tectonic plate crept over a largely stationary plume. Kent likens the process to a conveyor belt moving over a blowtorch.A volcanic hotspot is also the explanation for the infamous Yellowstone caldera, which ranks just 21 on the new list. Though its supervolcano status has sparked a lot of bluster over the years, it's unlikely it will erupt anytime soon.“I want to emphasize this in bold, underlined, blinking text: We are in no way overdue for an eruption in Yellowstone,” Andrews says.The updated rankings are based on 15 hazard factors, including the type of volcano, the known frequency of eruptions, the threat of triggering a tsunami, and the potential for volcanic mudslides, or lahars. The rankings also take into account nine so-called exposure factors, which relate to the threats to local communities, such as past fatalities and nearby population density.Each volcano gets rankings for these individual factors that contribute to its final overall hazard score. The final list is then divided into five categories based on the threat level: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Kent notes that he sees these larger groupings are more important than each individual number.The risks posed by volcanoes have continually increased, Krippner says. “But that's not because the volcanoes are changing,” she says. “That's because we're closer to them.” (See where people live in the shadow of active volcanoes.)In addition to noting population increases and proximity, the new report pays particular attention to aviation threats. Flying through volcanic ash clouds is extremely dangerous and can cause issues such as engine erosion, clogged air filters, and even complete engine failure.Since the 2005 report, estimates of air traffic over Alaska's volcanoes has tripled from some 20,000 people a day to an estimated 60,000 each day. That's part of why the list includes five of Alaska's peaks among the 18 “very high threat” volcanoes.Overall, though, the new rankings closely resemble those in the 2005 report, which also placed Kīlauea in the top slot. The same 18 volcanoes also remained in the “very high threat” category.“Things wiggled a bit,” Andrews says, but the fact that not much has changed is positive news. “It suggests we have a pretty good handle on what are the really dangerous volcanos.”The list does include eight fewer volcanoes than the 2005 report, following changes to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program. This “loss” is largely due to more accurate dating methods, which place some volcanoes' last known eruptions further in the past than previously thought. If the last known eruptions date to before 11,700 years ago, the volcanoes are considered inactive. (Here's how ancient volcanic eruptions may have helped kill the dinosaurs.)The new rankings make only three exceptions to this rule: Wyoming's Yellowstone supervolcano, New Mexico's Valles caldera, and California's Long Valley volcano. These three are particularly sizable and are thought to erupt on intervals much longer than the 11,700-year cutoff, Andrews says.“If you live in volcano country, like if you live in hurricane country or earthquake country, just take the time to inform yourself and be prepared,” says Oregon State University's Kent. If you are in a dangerous region, he suggests maintaining a basic disaster kit.You can also arm yourself with the knowledge of where the hazards are and how to respond, Krippner adds. The USGS has many online resources to help locals and visitors understand volcanic dangers nearby.“This is a really good opportunity to remind people that, yeah, this is one of the most volcanically active countries in the world; it needs to be a priority for funding and monitoring,” Krippner says. “USGS is working incredibly hard to understand what these hazards are and communicate them—and everyone needs to listen.”The 18 volcanoes included in the “very high threat” category are:  1. Kīlauea, Hawaii 2. Mount St. Helens, Washington 3. Mount Rainier, Washington 4. Redoubt Volcano, Alaska 5. Mount Shasta, California 6. Mount Hood, Oregon 7. Three Sisters, Oregon 8. Akutan Island, Alaska 9. Makushin Volcano, Alaska 10. Mount Spurr, Alaska 11. Lassen volcanic center, California 12. Augustine Volcano, Alaska 13. Newberry Volcano, Oregon 14. Mount Baker, Washington 15. Glacier Peak, Washington 16. Mauna Loa, Hawaii 17. Crater Lake, Oregon 18. Long Valley Caldera, California",
"Lava spews out of a fissure in the Virunga mountains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Virunga chain is part of the East African Rift Valley system, which marks the boundary between two plates: the Nubian plate to the west and the Somalian plate to the east. The rift valley is a classic example of a divergent plate boundary.There are a few handfuls of major plates and dozens of smaller, or minor, plates. Six of the majors are named for the continents embedded within them, such as the North American, African, and Antarctic plates. Though smaller in size, the minors are no less important when it comes to shaping the Earth. The tiny Juan de Fuca plate is largely responsible for the volcanoes that dot the Pacific Northwest of the United States.The plates make up Earth's outer shell, called the lithosphere. (This includes the crust and uppermost part of the mantle.) Churning currents in the molten rocks below propel them along like a jumble of conveyor belts in disrepair. Most geologic activity stems from the interplay where the plates meet or divide.The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic boundaries: convergent, where plates move into one another; divergent, where plates move apart; and transform, where plates move sideways in relation to each other.They move at a rate of one to two inches (three to five centimeters) per year.Where plates serving landmasses collide, the crust crumples and buckles into mountain ranges. India and Asia crashed about 55 million years ago, slowly giving rise to the Himalaya, the highest mountain system on Earth. As the mash-up continues, the mountains get higher. Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, may be a tiny bit taller tomorrow than it is today.These convergent boundaries also occur where a plate of ocean dives, in a process called subduction, under a landmass. As the overlying plate lifts up, it also forms mountain ranges. In addition, the diving plate melts and is often spewed out in volcanic eruptions such as those that formed some of the mountains in the Andes of South America.At ocean-ocean convergences, one plate usually dives beneath the other, forming deep trenches like the Mariana Trench in the North Pacific Ocean, the deepest point on Earth. These types of collisions can also lead to underwater volcanoes that eventually build up into island arcs like Japan.At divergent boundaries in the oceans, magma from deep in the Earth's mantle rises toward the surface and pushes apart two or more plates. Mountains and volcanoes rise along the seam. The process renews the ocean floor and widens the giant basins. A single mid-ocean ridge system connects the world's oceans, making the ridge the longest mountain range in the world.On land, giant troughs such as the Great Rift Valley in Africa form where plates are tugged apart. If the plates there continue to diverge, millions of years from now eastern Africa will split from the continent to form a new landmass. A mid-ocean ridge would then mark the boundary between the plates.Mountains and a rift can be seen along the San Andreas Fault.The San Andreas Fault in California is an example of a transform boundary, where two plates grind past each other along what are called strike-slip faults. These boundaries don't produce spectacular features like mountains or oceans, but the halting motion often triggers large earthquakes, such as the 1906 one that devastated San Francisco.",
"The Pu'u o Maui cinder cone is part of a dormant volcano in Haleakala National Park on Maui, Hawai.There’s no geological artist quite like Earth’s plate tectonics. Thanks to this ongoing operation, we have mountains and oceans, terrifying earthquakes, incandescent volcanic eruptions, and new land being born every single second.But nothing lasts forever.Eventually, the mantle will cool to such an extent that this planetwide conveyor belt will grind to a halt. At that point, you can say farewell to the carbon cycle, as well as the constant reshaping and reshuffling of landmasses that have been big drivers of evolution over eons.Quiming Cheng, a mathematical geoscientist and president of the International Union of Geological Sciences, is the latest to take on the prophetic role of predicting when this bleak day may arrive. He calculates that the shutdown will arrive in about 1.45 billion years. That’s well before the sun is expected to swell into a red giant and consume us in its death throes roughly 5.4 billion years from now. (Here’s why tardigrades may be the only life-forms that survive until the world’s end.)A startling sunset reddens the Lemaire Channel, off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The continent’s coastal ice is crumbling as the sea and air around it warm. This photo originally published in “The Larsen C Ice Shelf Collapse Is Just the Beginning—Antarctica Is Melting.”The study, published this month in Gondwana Research, has provoked controversy, and some experts argue that we can never accurately predict the end of plate tectonics. But scientists largely agree that such an end will arrive one day, putting Earth on a path to a geologic standstill.So, what will our home world be like when those major planetary processes give up the ghost?Figuring that out means first understanding how plate tectonics work. Earth was born 4.54 billion years ago in the pyres of the early solar system. Once entirely molten, the heat generated by its formation and radioactive materials in the rock began to escape. As the planet cooled, Earth settled into its current layered structure, with a dense inner iron core, a liquid outer core, and a brittle upper mantle and crust sandwiching the hot, plastic-like rock of the lower mantle.Anywhere between 600 million and 3.5 billion years ago, slabs made of the crust and upper mantle–collectively known as the lithosphere–became cold and dense enough to be able to sink into the lower mantle, kicking off the era of plate tectonics. The lithosphere became divided into a jigsaw puzzle of plates that are constantly jostling across the planet’s surface, driving geological action above and below the oceans. (Meet the next supercontinent, Pangaea Proxima.)At mid-ocean ridges, mantle material rises, decompresses, and triggers profuse melting, creating oceanic lithosphere. The colder and denser edges of the slabs help pull this lithospheric plate away from these ridges and down into the depths. They usually dive beneath a less dense oceanic or continental plate in a process known as subduction. This activity generates explosive volcanoes and fresh crust at the surface.When two continental slabs collide, they buckle, and mountain ranges like the Alps or the Himalaya form. Upwelling mantle plumes can sometimes appear beneath continental or oceanic slabs, and this ever-moving center of melting creates chains of volcanoes.At some point, though, the mantle will cool to such an extent that the slabs can no longer sink into it, and several studies have attempted to predict when this will transpire.Cheng’s new paper uses mathematical models to estimate how fast the mantle is cooling, based on what we know about the intensity of the planet’s magmatic activity from three billion years ago to now. That, he says, gives us a first-order estimate of when plate tectonics will end.Regardless of the precision of this figure, plate tectonics will inevitably perish, says Ken Hudnut, a research geophysicist working with the United States Geological Survey. When that day arrives, it “may well be the end of the world as we know it.”Earth would likely enter a single lid regime, a completed jigsaw of titanic slabs that will no longer drift or sink. Mountain building will stop, but Earth will still have an atmosphere, so erosion by wind and waves will shave down the mighty peaks to hilly plateaus. Eventually, much of the flattened continents will be underwater.Subduction zones will no longer exist, so while earthquakes will still happen every now and then, truly earthshattering events above magnitude 7 or so will be consigned to history. At the same time, much of the world’s explosive volcanism would be extinguished—although volcanoes would not be entirely snuffed out.Mars, a world of failed plate tectonics, did manage to forge some impressive volcanic features, including Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. Without moving plates, a long-lived upwelling mantle plume focused plenty of crustal melting on that one single spot.While the mantle of future Earth remains warm enough to convect and partially melt, we would get similar but scattered stationary hot spots of plume-driven volcanism. We would never get anything as large as Olympus Mons on Earth, as our gravitational field is too strong, and anything that massive and tall would simply sink into the crust. Instead, our voluminous volcanoes would be flatter and far more spread out.And as happens today, parts of the lower lithosphere would continue to peel off and fall into particularly hot parts of the mantle. This would cause mantle material to rise in its place, pushing up the crust and forming isolated mountain ranges and associated basins. This activity would cause minor earthquakes and maybe even additional pockets of volcanism.“These are the processes that shape Venus' surface,” says Robert Stern, a plate tectonics expert at the University of Texas at Dallas, referring to another world without fully-functioning plate tectonics. But eventually, as cooling continues, those mechanisms will also cease to be, and the planet’s final volcanic lights will be snuffed out. The mantle will be relatively frigid, and Earth will “become a dead planet, like Mercury,” he says.Perhaps just before it does, Earth’s liquid core will cool enough to end convection, causing the planet’s protective magnetic field to fail. The sun’s stream of energetic particles will strip away our atmosphere, and its expansion will boil away the oceans.“There is not a lot to look forward to after plate tectonics’ demise,” Hudnut says. The planet will just keep getting flatter and more boring, he predicts, until “Earth splashes into what’s left of the sun.”Other researchers have come up with different plate tectonic death dates. One 2016 study used extremely detailed but simplified computer simulations to put the end date at five billion years, roughly around the time of the sun’s demise.Another 2008 paper used evidence of past plate tectonic activity to suggest that plate tectonics are intermittent. Its authors predict that the next major pause will take place 350 million years from now, when the Pacific Ocean closes and its many subduction zones deactivate.“The question is a good one, and yes, it will end eventually,” says Stern. However, he fundamentally disagrees with the new study’s reasoning. “I don't believe any estimated time of death for plate tectonics,” he says.Christopher Scotese, an emeritus plate tectonics specialist at the University of Texas at Arlington, suggests that the paper shouldn’t have focused on mantle cooling. Instead, it should have based its efforts on the slab pull mechanism, because “slab pull rules.”Instead of a gradual slowdown, Scotese predicts that plate tectonics will be invigorated during the next one to two billion years, before the conveyor belt ends. He reasons that as the mantle heat flow diminishes, the slabs will become extremely cool and dense, allowing them to subduct faster.Hudnut notes that predicting any future geophysical events is, even in the short term, “challenging beyond current human capabilities.” Despite this, he emphasizes that it’s good to think ahead. And while none of the predictive papers are perfect, they do highlight the complexity of the subject matter and where there are intriguing gaps in our knowledge of how our own home planet operates.The wildly differing models “help clarify our ideas about why plate tectonics happen in the first place,” Scotese says. “There may be things we figure out about the future that can be applied to the past.”",
"Seismic data like the lines pictured on this 3D map help scientists understand the structure of the earth's core. This particular map helps scientists at Chesapeake Energy’s Oklahoma City headquarters choose the best spots to drill.The Earth's interior is composed of four layers, three solid and one liquid—not magma but molten metal, nearly as hot as the surface of the sun.  The deepest layer is a solid iron ball, about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) in diameter. Although this inner core is white hot, the pressure is so high the iron cannot melt.  The iron isn't pure—scientists believe it contains sulfur and nickel, plus smaller amounts of other elements. Estimates of its temperature vary, but it is probably somewhere between 9,000 and 13,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,000 and 7,000 degrees Celsius).  Above the inner core is the outer core, a shell of liquid iron. This layer is cooler but still very hot, perhaps 7,200 to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,000 to 5,000 degrees Celsius). It too is composed mostly of iron, plus substantial amounts of sulfur and nickel. It creates the Earth's magnetic field and is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick.The next layer is the mantle. Many people think of this as lava, but it's actually rock. The rock is so hot, however, that it flows under pressure, like road tar. This creates very slow-moving currents as hot rock rises from the depths and cooler rock descends.The mantle is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and appears to be divided into two layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The boundary between the two lies about 465 miles (750 kilometers) beneath the Earth's surface.The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth. It is the familiar landscape on which we live: rocks, soil, and seabed. It ranges from about five miles (eight kilometers) thick beneath the oceans to an average of 25 miles (40 kilometers) thick beneath the continents.Currents within the mantle have broken the crust into blocks, called plates, which slowly move around, colliding to build mountains or rifting apart to form new seafloor.Continents are composed of relatively light blocks that float high on the mantle, like gigantic, slow-moving icebergs. Seafloor is made of a denser rock called basalt, which presses deeper into the mantle, producing basins that can fill with water.Except in the crust, the interior of the Earth cannot be studied by drilling holes to take samples. Instead, scientists map the interior by watching how seismic waves from earthquakes are bent, reflected, sped up, or delayed by the various layers.",
"The continents are in constant motion: Tectonic plates crash together and break apart, creating new crust while old crust is pulled below the surface. The process shrinks and widens oceans, uplifts mountain ranges, and rearranges landmasses. In about 250 million years a new supercontinent, Pangaea Proxima, will form.",
"When the first thunderous boom echoed across the plain of Campania, quickly followed by a blistering hail of volcanic rock, the man and the woman hastily abandoned their village and made a run for it to the east, up a gently sloping hill toward what must have seemed like possible sanctuary in a nearby forest. She was about 20 years old; he was in his mid-40s. A violent downpour of rubbly pumice mixed with incandescent rocks capable of crushing skulls and scalding skin obscured their escape. To their uncomprehending minds, the calamity descending upon them must have seemed like the end of the world.Thousands of other people were at that same moment running for their lives, marking the soft ash and wet volcanic mud with footprints of human desperation that would remain undiscovered for millennia. The people whose footprints led to the north or northwest chose a path that probably saved their lives; those who set out to the east, like the young woman and the older man, toward the present-day Italian town of Avellino, unwittingly chose a path that led to certain death. They headed, by ill luck, smack into the middle of a fallout zone that would be swiftly buried under three feet of pumice.Battered by the fallout as if stoned by the gods, weary with the effort and terrorized by the darkness that descended around them, each breath more labored than the one before, the couple—surely united in their desperation if not by any ancient form of matrimony—began to slow down. After struggling part way up the hill, a hill that rises toward a promontory now called Castel Cicala, they finally collapsed and fell to the ground, in the final throes of asphyxiation."They couldn't have seen more than a few feet in front of themselves," Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo was saying. A volcanologist at the Osservatorio Vesuviano in Naples, Mastrolorenzo stood in a small, well-lit room in the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Naples, leaning over a display case containing the beautifully preserved skeleton of the young woman extended on a bed of pumice, just as it had been found."In the eruption that buried Pompeii and Herculaneum, the deaths were instantaneous. People didn't know what was happening to them," added Pier Paolo Petrone, the anthropologist who had excavated and analyzed the woman's skeleton. "But her death was more tragic because it wasn't sudden." In one final, futile gesture of self-protection, the woman and the man raised their arms to shield their faces—and wore that fretful salute into eternity.The bones lay where the couple fell until December 1995, when Italian archaeologists, digging a test hole for a future gas pipeline outside the small town of San Paolo Bel Sito, about ten miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Vesuvius, discovered a human skeleton nested in the roots of a hazelnut tree. It was the woman. Soon after, they uncovered a second skeleton, the man, beside the first.Organized crime has made a lamentable comeback in the squat, dusty towns surrounding Naples, and when workers stumble upon human remains, it's sometimes a tough decision whether to call in an archaeologist or a homicide detective. Not in this case. The skeletons' final resting place, a bumpy bed of volcanic rock covered by pumice, provided a precise geologic time stamp for the moment of death. All that was required was a volcanologist to read the layers of rock. That process was set in motion when Petrone and Mastrolorenzo got news of the discovery. Petrone rushed to the site; authorities granted him exactly two afternoons to extract the bones. "It was a miracle that we were able to save this," Petrone said.The skeletons of San Paolo Bel Sito—frozen in terrified flight, their choice of a mistaken escape route immortalized in their weary, ossified repose—offered Italian scientists clues in a project that has combined volcanology, archaeology, and physical anthropology into something like a CSI: Vesuvius. Over the past decade the project has rewritten the story of the nearby volcano, adding ominous fuel to scientific debates about the danger of future eruptions.The man and woman were not doomed refugees of the famous A.D. 79 eruption that buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. Rather they were Bronze Age inhabitants of one of the dozens of prehistoric villages that dotted this beautiful, fertile plain during an earlier—and, it turns out, more violent—eruption of Vesuvius. The Avellino eruption occurred approximately 3,780 years ago, and researchers now argue that it represents the nightmare blueprint for a future calamity that could envelop Naples itself.Since 1995, Petrone and Mastrolorenzo have roved the countryside of Campania, the region that surrounds Naples, a bit like the archaeological version of storm chasers, hustling to newly discovered excavation sites before the evidence can be removed or covered up. They have pieced together an anthropological and volcanological picture of the Avellino eruption—from thousands of fleeing footsteps of its victims, preserved in volcanic ash, to a spectacularly preserved prehistoric village (since dismantled) that was practically abandoned with dinner on the table—that has redefined the volcanic might and environmental toll of Vesuvius. They have not only given eloquent voice to the skeletons of San Paolo Bel Sito, but their enterprising research has turned that voice into a stark warning: Beware, modern Naples and surroundings, with your three million inhabitants, because an eruption of this magnitude is likely to happen again, and perhaps (in geologic time) very soon.Ancient peoples gravitated to the plain of Campania for the same reasons we do today: clement weather, access to the sea (and sea-food) at the present-day Gulf of Naples, fertile volcanic soil, and perhaps even the beauty that has captivated writers from Virgil to Stendhal. Long before Aeneas returned from his travels, more than a thousand years before Greeks settled in Cumae and ruled the Campanian plain, prehistoric settlers came down out of the nearby Apennines and began to tame the land, growing cereal crops and tending flocks.Later the Greeks moved east from Cumae to Neapolis, the New City, a little farther along the coast where modern Naples now stands. We have a very good idea what life in this sun-splashed land was like during the Roman era because of the recovered splendor of Pompeii and Herculaneum. But as the well-trod earth of Campania continues to yield ancient secrets, Mastrolorenzo and Petrone, with their colleague Lucia Pappalardo, have put together a rich view of an earlier time and what may have been humankind's first encounter with the primal force of Vesuvius.Almost all has come to light by chance. In May 2001, for example, construction workers began digging the foundation for a supermarket next to a desolate, weed-strewn intersection just outside the town of Nola. An archaeologist working for the province of Naples noticed several traces of burned wood a few feet below the surface, an indication of earlier human habitation. At 19 feet (6 meters) below, relicts of a perfectly preserved Early Bronze Age village began to emerge.Over the next several months, the excavation unearthed three large prehistoric dwellings: horseshoe-shaped huts with clearly demarked entrances, living areas, and the equivalent of kitchens. Researchers found dozens of pots, pottery plates, and crude hourglass-shaped canisters that still contained fossilized traces of almonds, flour, grain, acorns, olive pits, even mushrooms. Simple partitions separated the rooms; one hut had what appeared to be a loft. The tracks of goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs, as well as their human masters, crisscrossed the yard outside. The skeletons of nine pregnant goats lay in an enclosed area that included an animal pen. If a skeleton can be said to cower, the bones of an apparently terrified dog huddled under the eaves of one roof. What preserved this prehistoric village, what formed a perfect impression of its quotidian contents right down to leaves in the thatch roofs and cereal grains in the kitchen containers, was the fallout and surge and mud from the Avellino eruption of Vesuvius. Claude Albore Livadie, a French archaeologist who published the initial report on the Nola discovery, dubbed it "a first Pompeii."During May and June 2001, provincial archaeological authorities oversaw excavation of the site. Mastrolorenzo hurried out to Nola, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) east of Naples. He and Pappalardo took samples of the ash and volcanic deposits, which contained chemical clues to the magnitude of the eruption. But then the scientific story veered off into the familiar opera buffa of Italian archaeology. The owner of the site agitated for construction of the supermarket to resume or to be compensated for the delay—not an unusual dilemma in a country where the backhoes and bulldozers of a modern economy clang against the ubiquitous remains of ancient civilizations.Government archaeologists hastily excavated the site and removed the objects. As it turns out, the supermarket was never built, and all that remains of a site that miraculously captured one of civilization's earliest encounters with volcanic destruction is a hole in the ground on a vacant, weed-choked lot, the foundation walls of the huts barely visible. A small, weathered sign proclaiming the "Pompeii of Prehistory" hangs limply from a padlocked gate.The sad archaeological scenario of Nola has repeated itself several times. In 2002, an Italian construction company under contract to the U.S. government to build a support facility for the large U.S. Navy base in the southern Mediterranean uncovered another ash-covered village near the modern town of Gricignano di Aversa; it was, according to Mastrolorenzo, even more extensive than the Nola site, with traces of numerous Copper and Bronze Age huts. "They spend a short time 'documenting' the site," Petrone said sarcastically of archaeologists who examine construction sites, "and then it is destroyed."In the summer of 2004, during construction of the new high-speed railroad line between Naples and Rome, thousands of human footprints were uncovered near the town of Afragola. Geologic analysis established that they were the footprints of Bronze Age inhabitants fleeing the Avellino event. The threesome rushed to photograph the vivid residue of that ancient terror.Despite the loss of these sites, Mastrolorenzo, Petrone, Pappalardo, and American volcanologist Michael Sheridan triggered worldwide fascination when they summarized these findings in the spring of 2006 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). But their research went beyond mere archaeological documentation. The Avellino event, they wrote, "caused a social-demographic collapse and the abandonment of the entire area for centuries." The new findings, along with computer models, show that an Avellino-size eruption would unleash a concentric wave of destruction that could devastate Naples and much of its surroundings. In the world before Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami, these warnings might have sounded as remote and transitory as those prehistoric footsteps. Not anymore.There are many ways for a human being to die after a volcano erupts, and a blast like the one Vesuvius unleashed in 1780 B.C. provides a grim inventory of almost all of them. "In the first hours of the Avellino eruption, material like this fell," Mastrolorenzo explained, dropping two transparent bags of volcanic material on the desk in his office at the Osservatorio Vesuviano. One of the bags contained a fine white powder, the ash that blanketed the fallout zone; the other was full of small rocks, no more than an inch or two in diameter. Some of the rocks were pumice, pebbles honeycombed with bubbles and nearly as light as Ping-Pong balls; others were dense and hard. "These are lighter than water; they float," he said, picking up a piece of pumice. "But these," he continued, picking up one of the harder rocks, called lapilli, "these were falling at about 90 miles (145 kilometers) per hour."The first hint of the Avellino eruption of Vesuvius emerged in the early 1970s when volcanologists identified pumice deposits underneath the A.D. 79 residues. But in recent years Mastrolorenzo, Pappalardo, and their colleagues, analyzing everything from meters-thick ash deposits visible in road cuts to micron-thin slices of volcanic crystals viewed in a scanning electron microscope, have reconstructed the Avellino event in harrowing detail.Some eruptions ooze lava in picturesque, slow-moving streams. But in an event like Avellino, the conduit of the volcano is so tightly corked by solid rock that it takes an enormous amount of pressure building up from below, in the magma chamber, to blow a hole to the surface. When it does, the violence of the explosion—the boato,Italian for the enormous roar—propels liquid rock into the air so fast that it breaks the sound barrier, unleashing a sonic boom. During the Avellino eruption, the boato accompanied a blast that hurled nearly 100,000 tons a second of superheated rock, cinders, and ash into the stratosphere. It reached an altitude of about 22 miles (35 kilometers)—roughly three times the cruising altitude of commercial airliners. As this incredible cloud of material rose, it spread at the top, assuming the classic shape—classic ever since Pliny the Younger first described it in a letter to the Roman historian Tacitus about the later eruption that buried Pompeii—of an umbrella pine tree, the iconic feature of a plinian eruption.Prevailing winds out of the west carried the bulk of the initial fallout in a northeasterly direction, toward Nola and Avellino, where pumice and lapilli deposits piled up as high as nine feet (three meters) near the volcano in several hours. The column of ash may have hovered in the air for up to 12 hours. Then it collapsed, producing an apocalyptic sequence of events that makes a plinian eruption one of the most lethal natural disasters on Earth.When a plinian column falls upon itself, it creates a pyroclastic surge—a boiling, turbulent avalanche of debris that shoots out sideways from the slopes of a volcano. This searing cloud can travel for many miles, initially at great speed. Not too many humans have seen (much less survived) a pyroclastic surge at close quarters, but many of us have an image of its horrifying power burned into our memories: It shares many physical properties with the huge clouds of powder and ash produced by the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in 2001.Unlike the collapsed towers, the material in a pyroclastic surge is baked in a subterranean magma chamber to temperatures of up to 1650°F (899°C). The initial surge of the Avellino eruption, especially in the zones closest to Vesuvius, was instantly lethal. Hot, choking wind, advancing at about 240 miles (386 kilometers) an hour, reached temperatures of at least 900°F (482°C), and retained enough heat to bring water to a boil ten miles (16 kilometers) from the vent. "Below 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93°C), you can survive for several seconds, perhaps, if the wave passes quickly," Mastrolorenzo pointed out. "But even if you survive the temperature, you will suffocate on the fine powder in the air. The entire countryside surrounding Vesuvius was covered by foot upon foot of this powder, 65 feet (20 meters) deep at a distance of three miles (five kilometers) from the crater to about ten inches (25 centimeters) thick at a distance of 15 miles (24 kilometers). Eight inches (20 centimeters) of ash is enough to cause modern roofs to collapse."The sizzling temperature of a Vesuvian surge has emerged as a key factor in explaining what happened at Pompeii and Herculaneum in the next great eruption, 1,900 years later. Petrone and Mastrolorenzo, with colleagues in Italy and England, published a paper in the journal Nature in 2001 demonstrating that hundreds of fugitives who gathered in 12 seafront fornici, or boathouses, facing the beach of Herculaneum died instantly from a pyroclastic surge that reached temperatures of 932°F (500°C), vaporizing clothing and flesh within seconds.In a grim bit of forensic paleoanthropology, Petrone and Mastrolorenzo reconstructed a parting picture of the victims huddled inside fornici 5, 10, and 12. The heat would have boiled their brain tissue, which would then have burst out in small, scalding explosions that left blue-black burn marks on the bone. Moisture from vaporized flesh and blood combined with volcanic ash in the surge to create a protective, plasterlike material that preserved the bones, and from the posture of the skeletons they could determine that victims in the fornici died instantly. (Petrone keeps samples of the bones, along with the San Paolo Bel Sito skeletons, in several large shopping bags in his office.)The pyroclastic surge is just the first part of the one-two punch delivered by the collapse of a plinian column. When the vast amount of solid ash and debris mixes with steam fed by underground aquifers, a violent microclimate of pitched thunderstorms and torrential rains occurs, producing great mudflows. Ash falling into rivers creates more mudflows, known as lahars, that fill river valleys long after the eruption is over. "There are more victims from the mudflows than from the eruption itself," Mastrolorenzo says. "These mudflows travel with a force that moves houses hundreds of meters."Blast, fallout, column collapse, surge, flow: In this classic sequence of plinian fury, the Avellino eruption disfigured the plain of Campania as rudely as if the gods had scraped, gouged, and reshaped the landscape with a giant trowel. The pattern of its deposits, the swirl of its volcanic signature in layers thick and thin, has allowed volcanologists to conclude that Vesuvius unleashed at least six cycles of pyroclastic surge and flow in that single eruption—six bursts of searing winds followed by six rampaging rivers of mud—that destroyed everything within about nine miles (14 kilometers) of the volcano. The immediate cataclysm probably lasted less than 24 hours, but it turned an idyllic landscape into a monochromatic desert, uninhabitable for 300 years.The road that snakes up from the Gulf of Naples to the summit of Vesuvius reveals one more way a human being can perish on the slopes of this volcano: getting hit by one of the countless tour buses careening around the tight turns along the route from Ercolano to the 4,203-foot (1,281 meters) summit. Long gone are the days when brawny Neapolitan youths hoisted chairs bearing celebrities like Goethe and lugged them up the steep path to what the German writer memorably called "this peak of hell which towers up in the middle of paradise." Paradise nowadays is finding a free spot in the crowded car park.After buying your ticket (the top of the volcano is now part of a national park), you hike along a path zigzagging over the rusty, iron-rich cinders of the cone. You pass several souvenir shops as well as the abandoned concrete piers of the funicular cableway that replaced the broad-shouldered youths (the original 19th-century version of this conveyance inspired the famous Neapolitan song "Funiculì, Funiculà"). And finally, you arrive at the rim of the crater, where the view on a clear day takes in everything from Capri and the Sorrentine Peninsula to the south, to modern-day Naples to the northwest, to Pompeii and Herculaneum, victims of the geophysical power momentarily contained beneath your feet.After an enormous sub-plinian eruption in 1631, Vesuvius has adopted a more benign personality. It produced copious streams of lava during frequent eruptions in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries (when Mastrolorenzo was a child, his grandmother used to describe the time his grandfather swept ash and cinders off roofs in Naples following an event in 1906). But since its last eruption in 1944, the conduit has been plugged, and no one younger than 63 years of age has experienced an eruption. The occasional reminders that the volcano is still active produce a complex state of philosophical denial among people who live on or near Vesuvius. They tend to pooh-pooh the danger and, perhaps more than in many other parts of Italy, live for the moment in a gracefully fatalistic way.Few people spend more waking hours, day in and day out, in close proximity to Vesuvius than Gennaro Cardoncello, a stolid and friendly young man who tends the last outpost of commerce on the crater rim. As he stood behind a truly astonishing array of curios carved from volcanic rock (Buddha, the Pietà, frogs, owls, the Three Graces), he was asked if he ever feels the small earthquakes or tremors that are believed to signal the run-up to an eruption."Maybe a few times, but it's not a big deal," he said. With that sloe-eyed look of indifference that has been elevated to performance art in Naples and environs, Cardoncello shrugged his shoulders and changed the subject, producing a bottle of Lacryma Cristi, the local white wine whose grapes draw on Vesuvius's rich soil to produce their intense taste.Streams of tourists clamber up the steep path to the crater, oohing at the postcard-perfect vistas in every direction, aahing as they peer down from the rim of the crater 800 feet (244 meters) to the floor, where several fumaroles barely manage to etch the air with their noxious breath. Few of these volca-tourists pause to think about the vast reservoir of molten rock about six miles (ten kilometers) below or contemplate the curving remnant of the larger, more ancient Monte Somma crater that funnels the view—and more important, would funnel any future pyroclastic surges—in a northwesterly direction toward metropolitan Naples. When Vesuvius had its last plinian eruption, the plain below was inhabited by thousands of sybaritic Romans; now it is inhabited by upwards of one million people in Naples alone, and hundreds of thousands more in the towns between the city and the crater.On a clear day, with even modest binoculars, it is possible to stand on the crater rim and make out the massive 13th-century Angevin fortress in downtown Naples known as Maschio Angioino. Also known as Castel Nuovo, it is where the French Angevin monarchy first settled, and it marks the geographic and, in some ways, the emotional heart of the city. Several days after I visited the summit, Mastrolorenzo led me deep into the fortress's foundation, two floors beneath the elegant chamber where until recently the Naples City Council held its weekly meetings. He pointed to a deposit of volcanic pumice and ash roughly two and a half feet thick. It came, he said, from the Avellino eruption.Michael Sheridan, a volcanologist at New York's University at Buffalo who collaborates with Mastrolorenzo, is an expert on catastrophic eruptions near densely populated urban centers. Sheridan has studied the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique, which devastated the town of St. Pierre, and has been closely watching Cotopaxi, an active volcano that threatens more than a million people in the Andes highlands of Ecuador. He was unaware of the Castel Nuovo deposit until I mentioned it to him. "That's really damning," he said. "St. Pierre was destroyed by eight inches of that stuff, and everyone died. There would be no survivors in that part of Naples."Scientists know from geologic records that Vesuvius has unleashed catastrophic plinian eruptions with a ragged but disquieting rhythm over recent geologic time. Since an eruption 25,000 years ago, major eruptions have occurred 22,500 years ago, 17,000 years ago, 15,000 years ago, 11,400 years ago, 8,000 years ago, then Avellino 3,780 years ago, and then the A.D.79 Pompeii eruption nearly 2,000 years ago. Based on an interval of about 2,000 years between these larger eruptions, Sheridan and Mastrolorenzo have calculated that there is a greater than 50 percent chance of a major eruption each year now, the odds rising incrementally as the time since the last big plinian event grows longer year by year.When Mastrolorenzo, Petrone, Pappalardo, and Sheridan published their research report on the Avellino eruption in March 2006, it sparked controversy with its blunt prediction that Vesuvius was due for a major eruption that could be powerful enough to threaten metropolitan Naples. Naples isn't even part of the current planning. The Italian emergency plan, introduced in 1995 and last revised in 2001, is based on a smaller, sub-plinian eruption and calls for the priority evacuation of the residents living in the immediate vicinity of Vesuvius—the 600,000 people who live in the so-called Zona Rossa, or Red Zone, defined by the boundaries of 18 municipalities on the slopes of the volcano.The Vesuvius emergency plan has not been significantly updated in more than five years. When the PNAS paper came out last year, laying out a much more dire scenario for Naples, the president of Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Enzo Boschi, denounced Sheridan's risk analysis as "alarmist and irresponsible," and flatly declared "the evacuation plans will not be changed." Some volcanologists at the University of Naples referred to the report's warnings as "scientific terrorism."Predicting an impending eruption is an imprecise science at best. Although Mount St. Helens gave signs of increasing restlessness preceding the 1980 eruption, according to a U.S. Geological Survey account, it "showed no change from the pattern of the preceding month," and monitors on the morning of May 18, 1980, "revealed no unusual changes that could be taken as warning signs for the catastrophe that would strike about an hour and a half later."If Vesuvius showed signs of rousing itself again, volcanologists believe they could predict that it was about to erupt in breve tempo, soon. When I asked Mastrolorenzo what exactly "soon" means, he replied: "This is the problem. We don't know—not in the way you can predict when a hurricane is likely to arrive." That imprecision could wreak havoc in a major metropolitan evacuation.It's not nice to needlessly scare people, but it's much less nice to contemplate what happens when lots of scared people try to do the same thing in a big hurry at the same time. This thought occurred to me one afternoon as I sat, motionless, in a huge traffic jam on the Tangenziale, the expressway that threads around downtown Naples and leads to the main autostrada that heads north toward Rome.What would happen if Vesuvius suddenly gave signs of becoming seriously restless? There would be, as there always is with probabilistic predictions, confusion and uncertainty. "It's hard to imagine what it would be like in the days leading up to an eruption," Mastrolorenzo said. "It would be worse than the eruption itself." Some Neapolitans might flee at the first hints of seismic indigestion, others might resolve to stay, still others might leave, grow disenchanted with weeks or months of seismic uncertainty, and then return. There simply is no modern precedent for an urban evacuation of this magnitude.On the Tangenziale, cars inched along at a crawl; four lanes of cars jockeyed to squeeze into two northbound lanes. It took me about an hour to traverse a mile, and the most urgent thing on anyone's agenda that day was getting to the beach. Traffic like this makes any emergency evacuation plan seem hopelessly optimistic. Indeed, during a Red Zone evacuation drill in October 2006, traffic on the nearby Napoli-Pompeii autostrada ground to a halt; an overnight thunderstorm seriously complicated the exodus; and one of the 18 towns, Portici, participated under protest. Government officials pronounced themselves pleased with the results; news accounts described "delays and chaos." And this was just a minimalist exercise, involving only a hundred citizens from each of the 18 Red Zone towns.In any event, a massive evacuation would have to be well under way prior to an Avellino-size eruption. Once the event began, once the volcano disgorged possibly billions of cubic feet of ash, rock, and debris into the air and sent it raining to the ground, all forms of transportation would become useless. Airplanes could not fly. Trains could not run. Neither cars nor buses nor scooters could function in even four or five inches of gritty ash. In fact, the only likely means of escape would be . . . by foot.Four thousand years after Avellino, the inhabitants of Campania would be reduced to leaving their footprints in the ash.",
"Scientists and artists often envision Earth’s earliest years as a hellscape, dominated by volcanoes and lava fields. But within a couple hundred million years, the landscape likely cooled enough to host water on it’s surface. Life may have soon followed.What did Earth look like more than 4 billion years ago? This was before humans carved its wonders on stone, before trees etched the seasons in their rings, before plate tectonics buckled Earth’s surface to expose the ancient layers in growing mountain belts.But scientists do have some clues in the form of an extremely tough mineral known as zircon.Zircon crystals are almost indestructible; some still around today are nearly 4.4 billion years old. They're like tiny time capsules that retain the chemical fingerprints of this extremely early time. “This is basically our only window into the formative stages of our planet,” says Dustin Trail of the University of Rochester.By decoding these chemical clues, scientists are slowly teasing out the environments that fostered the earliest glimmers of life. But exactly what the surface looked like at that time has long remained a mystery. Now, in a new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Trail and his colleagues pick apart the enigma.Using the chemical fingerprints of zircons, the team identified an array of sediments likely present on early Earth, where the oldest biochemical reactions could have brewed.The ASTER satellite captured this image of the Jack Hills region of Australia. It is the most ancient fragment of Earth’s crust yet found and contains zircons that date back nearly 4.4 billion years.When Earth first formed, more than 4.5 billion years ago, its surface likely looked nothing like it does today. Scientists often paint this period—aptly named the Hadean after Hades, the Greek god of the underworld—as a fiery hellscape under constant meteoric assault, replete with volcanoes gurgling lava at the surface.But all of this is based on inference—no physical evidence remains from Earth's first few hundred million years. “The Earth has done a great job erasing some of that information,” Trail says. Our planet is the ultimate recycler. Plate tectonics constantly repurpose old rock into new, and lava flows harden into fresh landscapes.Zircon crystals, however, are so tough that they often survive the intense temperatures and pressures of this recycling process, retaining clues about the environments in which they originally formed. Using zircon oxygen isotopes, researchers previously discovered that liquid water covered parts of our planet some 4.3 billion years ago, suggesting the surface cooled just a few hundred million years after our planet’s formation. And just last year, researchers found what they believe might be hints of early life in the form of carbon-rich inclusions in 4.1-billion-year-old zircons.But aside from these glimpses, the scenery on Earth’s surface during this time—including the environments that might have fostered these earliest sparks of life—largely remain a mystery.“If we can begin to constrain the types of materials that are around at that time,” Trail says, “that perhaps pushes us one step closer to understanding how biochemical reactions, or prebiotic reactions, may have utilized the crust at that time as a substrate.”For answers, Trail and his colleagues turned to silicon and oxygen. Together, these elements make up roughly 75 percent of the rocks on Earth today, he explains. And both have a useful feature: they have more than one type, or isotope.A pink chalcedony shows off its beauty. Chalcedonies include many types of cryptocrystalline quartz gems and feature a number of different colors. Geologists can tell a chalcedony from the arrangement and structure of its crystals.The formation, and transformation, of rocks changes their isotopic fingerprint. For example, rocks that form from cooling lava have vastly different signatures than clays that come from weathered rocks. And zircons—themselves starting off as different rock and sediment types before being buried deep in the Earth, melting, and then crystallizing—still hold the signature of those early sediments.To conduct the delicate analysis of silicon and oxygen contained in the zircons, the team turned to the high-resolution ion microprobe at the University of California, Los Angeles, which shoots a fine beam of charged atoms at the tiny samples and measures the ejected ions that bounce back.For the test, they collected zircons just older than 4 billion years—each about 100 microns across or roughly the width of a human hair—from the Jack Hills region of Western Australia. They compared the chemistry of these ancient minerals to that of younger zircons with more definitive origins as a “bridge” to help interpret the different ratios of isotopes, Trail explains.More than half of the ancient zircons tested reveal early interactions between water and rock, in a range of different environments.Some zircons contain the chemical signatures of rocks weathered by water to form clay. Other zircons bear the signatures of dissolved minerals that crystallize to form rocks like chert or banded iron formations in lakes or oceans. Still others have the signature of a process known as serpentinization, so called for its snake-skin-like texture and color. During this process, water reacts with rocks enriched in iron and magnesium, incorporating itself into the mineral structures.Most importantly, each of these processes creates a new environmental niche that could foster early biochemical reactions, the glimmers of early life.“That's a pretty cool result,” says Elizabeth Bell, a geochemist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the work. Many of these processes are largely indistinguishable from oxygen isotopes alone, she notes, calling the use of silicon "really significant.”Bell led the 2017 work that identified hints of a biosphere in 4.1-billion-year-old zircons. These latest results bolster her findings and other interpretations of early Earth. “It sort of all comes together in a nice picture,” she says.Everything around (and within) us once came from stardust, and the early processes that formed every molecule, mineral, and complex organism of today—from your cell phone to the food you eat to the heart pumping in your chest. And scientists are just beginning to tease out their origins.“We're at a really interesting point,” Trail says. “We're beginning to really piece together what our planet was like more than 4 billion years ago. And that's pretty exciting.”",
"About 4.567 billion years ago, a quivering bead of magma 93 million miles from the Sun cooled down until it grew a skin of rock. Eventually, it would be named Earth. We don’t know a lot about what the planet was like back then, because that primordial crust is almost entirely recycled–eroded away, pushed back down into the molten depths of the planet, or smashed to bits by the huge impacts that blasted Earth for its first few hundred million years.Geologists have wandered the planet to find scraps of the infant Earth. One mineral that is particularly precious to them is known as a zircon. Tiny zircon crystals can withstand billions of years of abuse–getting ripped out of their original rock, incorporated into new rocks, heated up, and squeezed at tremendous pressures–and yet still retain their original chemistry. Zircons have the added attraction of holding onto radioactive isotopes such as uranium. Over billions of years, the uranium decays at a steady rate into lead. By measuring the atoms of uranium and lead in a zircon, scientists can get a tight estimate of the zircon’s age.In 2001, scientists digging at a site in the Australian outback called Jack Hills found a zircon dating back about 4.4 billion years. It broke all records for the oldest zircon, and no one has broken its record since.Estimating the age of zircons from over four billion years ago pushes science’s powers of detection to their limits. And so it’s no surprise that the age of the Jack Hills zircon has been the subject of debate.Some critics have questioned whether the geological clock in the Jack Hills zircon has been running steadily this whole time. After the zircon got incorporated into younger rocks, it was heated up. Under such conditions, the uranium and lead inside a zircon may migrate around inside the mineral grain. To measure the age of a zircon, scientists only shave off a small portion of the zircon. If there’s been a lot of migration inside the mineral, that portion may be loaded with extra uranium and lead, or it may have lost some of atoms. In either case, the geological clock will be thrown off.Geologists are constantly raising these challenges and then meeting them. Yesterday in the journal Nature Geoscience, John Valley of the University of Wisconsin and his colleagues published a new study of the Jack Hills zircons. They performed a kind of geological X-ray, mapping the uranium-derived lead atoms from across a zircon grain to figure out how much they’ve moved around.The lead has indeed moved, Valley and his colleagues have found, but only a little. It has gathered into clumps that are too small and too closely packed to throw off the geological clock. The 4.4 billion-year age stands.In other words, the Jack Hill zircon existed in rocks that formed about 200 million years after the formation of the planet. That’s a long time for us mere humans, but it’s about four percent of the lifetime of the Earth. Looking inside the Jack Hills zircon, geologists have found hints that they formed in a cool crust below a liquid ocean. If that’s true, then it also means the Earth was hospitable for life by then.But there’s only so much insight you can get from a zircon that’s twice the thickness of a human hair. What geologists would love to find is an honest-to-goodness rock from 4.4 billion years ago–something you could hold in your hand. The oldest rocks with an uncontested age date back 4 billion years ago–400 million years younger than the Jack Hills zircon. If geologists could find rocks from 4.4 billion years ago, filled with a variety of minerals, they could learn much more about the early Earth.In the March issue of Scientific American, I have a story about rocks that may indeed be 4.4 billion years old–the oldest rocks on Earth, in other words. But these rocks, along the coast of Hudson Bay, have inspired an intense debate among geologists, some of whom argue that they’re actually much younger. The science is fascinating, and the stakes are big. You’ll need to buy a copy of the issue or access the story through a subscription, but I hope you’ll find it worth the effort.",
"Earth seems to fill the sky in this image taken by the crew of Apollo 17 in 1972. The picture marked the first time astronauts were able to photograph the south polar ice cap.Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.”Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. Since our calendar years have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years to account for the difference.Though we can't feel it, Earth zooms through its orbit at an average velocity of 18.5 miles a second. During this circuit, our planet is an average of 93 million miles away from the sun, a distance that takes light about eight minutes to traverse. Astronomers define this distance as one astronomical unit (AU), a measure that serves as a handy cosmic yardstick.Earth rotates on its axis every 23.9 hours, defining day and night for surface dwellers. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees away from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, giving us seasons. Whichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets winter. In the spring and fall, each hemisphere receives similar amounts of light. On two specific dates each year—called the equinoxes—both hemispheres get illuminated equally.About 4.5 billion years ago, gravity coaxed Earth to form from the gaseous, dusty disk that surrounded our young sun. Over time, Earth's interior—which is made mostly of silicate rocks and metals—differentiated into four layers.At the planet's heart lies the inner core, a solid sphere of iron and nickel that's 759 miles wide and as hot as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The inner core is surrounded by the outer core, a 1,400-mile-thick band of iron and nickel fluids. Beyond the outer core lies the mantle, a 1,800-mile-thick layer of viscous molten rock on which Earth's outermost layer, the crust, rests. On land, the continental crust is an average of 19 miles thick, but the oceanic crust that forms the seafloor is thinner—about three miles thick—and denser.Like Venus and Mars, Earth has mountains, valleys, and volcanoes. But unlike its rocky siblings, almost 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered in oceans of liquid water that average 2.5 miles deep. These bodies of water contain 97 percent of Earth's volcanoes and the mid-ocean ridge, a massive mountain range more than 40,000 miles long.Earth's crust and upper mantle are divided into massive plates that grind against each other in slow motion. As these plates collide, tear apart, or slide past each other, they give rise to our very active geology. Earthquakes rumble as these plates snag and slip past each other. Many volcanoes form as seafloor crust smashes into and slides beneath continental crust. When plates of continental crust collide, mountain ranges such as the Himalaya are pushed toward the skies.Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and one percent other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and argon. Much like a greenhouse, this blanket of gases absorbs and retains heat. On average, Earth's surface temperature is about 57 degrees Fahrenheit; without our atmosphere, it'd be zero degrees. In the last two centuries, humans have added enough greenhouse gases to the atmosphere to raise Earth's average temperature by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This extra heat has altered Earth's weather patterns in many ways.The atmosphere not only nourishes life on Earth, but it also protects it: It's thick enough that many meteorites burn up before impact from friction, and its gases—such as ozone—block DNA-damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the surface. But for all that our atmosphere does, it's surprisingly thin. Ninety percent of Earth's atmosphere lies within just 10 miles of the planet's surface.The silhouette of a woman is seen on a Norwegian island beneath the Northern Lights (aurora borealis).We also enjoy protection from Earth's magnetic field, generated by our planet's rotation and its iron-nickel core. This teardrop-shaped field shields Earth from high-energy particles launched at us from the sun and elsewhere in the cosmos. But due to the field's structure, some particles get funneled to Earth's Poles and collide with our atmosphere, yielding aurorae, the natural fireworks show known by some as the northern lights.Earth is the planet we have the best opportunity to understand in detail—helping us see how other rocky planets behave, even those orbiting distant stars. As a result, scientists are increasingly monitoring Earth from space. NASA alone has dozens of missions dedicated to solving our planet's mysteries.At the same time, telescopes are gazing outward to find other Earths. Thanks to instruments such as NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, astronomers have found more than 3,800 planets orbiting other stars, some of which are about the size of Earth, and a handful of which orbit in the zones around their stars that are just the right temperature to be potentially habitable. Other missions, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, are poised to find even more.",
"Was the creature that left these prints an animal, protist, or fungi? Chemistry provides new clues.The Ediacaran critters were an odd bunch—from ringed discs and patterned blobs to lumpy ropes and wavy fronds. Taking to the warm shallow seas as early as 570 million years ago, these soft and squishy misfits were Earth's earliest complex life.One of the most famous of the lot is Dickinsonia. This flattened, ribbed oval can grow over four feet across and sports a distinct ridge down its center. However, the question of what exactly Dickinsonia is has long puzzled scientists. At various points in history, they’ve assigned these curious forms to almost every kingdom of life. In recent decades, the debate has swirled around three groups: some researchers proposed fungi, others said protists, still others say animals.In a new study, published this week in Science, researchers used modern techniques to take a fresh look at the ancient creatures. Their results join mounting evidence that suggests Dickinsonia is among the earliest animal life yet found—predating the Cambrian explosion of life, which took place 541 million years ago and marked the rise of most major animal groups still around today.“This was already actually one of us,” says study author Jochen Brocks, paleobiogeochemist at Australian National University. “It was an animal.” Though Dickinsonia eventually went extinct, the animal is one of many early experiments in multicellular life that eventually gave rise to our modern menagerie.Italy's Mount Etna provides a vivid image of one of the birthplaces of igneous rock during a night eruption. Igneous rock forms when magma cools and solidifies. (Lava is magma that has reached the Earth's surface.) Etna also shows off the etymology of igneous, from the Latin word for fire.“I think it sort of completes the puzzle in our understanding of Dickinsonia,” says Mary Droser, a paleontologist at University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the work.In the past few years, she explains, paleontologists largely reached a consensus that Dickinsonia was an animal, based on studies of its imprints. But the new work builds on this evidence, using chemistry to support the animal hypothesis. “This is really helping to put Dickinsonia as part of the story of animal evolution on planet Earth,” Droser says.First discovered in 1946 in the Ediacara hills in the Flinders ranges of South Australia, these evolutionary oddballs bear only the vaguest resemblance to modern life-forms. Ediacarans are as “strange as life on another planet, but easier to reach,” described paleontologist Adolf Seilacher in a 2007 paper for the Geological Society of London, Special Publications.Their appearance marks a shift from tiny to tremendous life as evolution tested out body plans of increasing size. More than 50 types of Ediacarans are now known, and they have been found on every continent, save for Antarctica.By studying when big life burst onto the scene, scientists can better understand the makings of complex creatures. The work could also yield clues about how life arises on far-flung worlds. And compared to finagling research on other planets, “it's a lot cheaper to go back in time and look at how life unfolded on Earth,” Droser says.One challenge in studying Ediacarans is the issue of preservation. Their squishy bodies have long since decayed away, and they lack bones or shells that would remain in the fossil record. This means most of these forms are only known from imprints or traces of the ancient inhabitants—many of their delicate features likely lost in the crude traces. The creatures are also very early members of the evolutionary tree, differing greatly from modern life-forms, which makes it difficult to assign them branches. In the 1980s, researchers even proposed Ediacarans should be their own extinct kingdom.Past work has focused on physical analysis of Dickinsonia traces—growth and development, evidence of movement, size, and complexity. For new clues, in this latest study, scientists turned to molecular biomarkers known as sterols. Many critters make them, but they're slightly different for each group.Animals make a version known as cholesterols, “like we find in chicken McNuggets,” Brocks jokes. But Ediacarans weren't chowing down on fried foods. These chemical compounds actually play an important role in the membranes of the cells of virtually all animals, helping to regulate what goes in and out.Scientists have long used biomarker analysis to seek out algae in bulk sediments. “In this case, what you get is an average composition of the ecosystem that was living there,” explains Ilya Bobrovskiy, lead author of the new study and a PhD student at the Australian National University.Because the Ediacaran bodies are largely imprints, no one had attempted to test for biomarkers of these ancient weirdos. However, some Ediacaran imprints still sport a thin layer of organic material. And Bobrovskiy thought that perhaps the carbonaceous bonds in this organic film hold the secrets to what these bizarre forms once were.Brocks, Bobrovskiy’s graduate adviser, was skeptical. “I first thought it was a crazy idea,” he says. But not wanting to discourage his ambitious student, he gave the go-ahead.Bobrovskiy developed a method to test for fossil sterols in the remnants of the Ediacarans, comparing the results to biomarkers extracted from the surrounding rock.To test the method, Bobrovskiy first turned to the Ediacaran creature Beltanelliformis, once thought to be related to algae, fungus, or even jellyfish. The biomarkers instead pointed to it being spherical colonies of cyanobacteria. They published their analysis earlier this year in Nature Ecology and Evolution.Then the team turned to Dickinsonia, collecting samples from the White Sea region of northwest Russia.“The molecular composition of the fossil and the molecular composition from the seafloor around the fossil was black and white,” Brocks says. An abundance of ancient cholesterols—up to 93 percent—in the trace remains pointed to animal. Whereas the surrounding seafloor had very little, and instead contained what's known as ergosteroids, suggesting the presence of green algae.The beautiful simplicity of the analysis is partly what makes this new work remarkable. “It's a very creative way to try to get at this question,” says Paula Welander, a microbiologist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study. “It's one of those things: Why didn't anyone think of doing it before?”The method will likely be useful to help understand other enigmatic Ediacarans, says Renee Hoekzema, a palaeontologist and mathematician at the University of Oxford who was not part of the work, via email. She'd be particularly interested in chemical analysis of the plume-like rangeomorphs, which may be related to Dickinsonia. This is one of the forms Brocks and his group are targeting next."This is an exciting time," Hoekzema says. "After seventy years of debate we are starting to get a grip on the enigmatic nature of the Ediacara biota."Over time, all organics break down. Cholesterol is no exception, Brocks notes. But the products of this decay are very specific, he explains, and “the original skeleton of the cholesterol” is still preserved in these molecular fossils.Welander, who studies the creation and function of modern sterols to help better interpret ancient traces, praises the rigorousness of the work, noting the team “really dotted all their i's and crossed all their t's.”Of course, nothing is ever certain in the world of science. The study is based on the assumption that only animals create cholesterols, which Welander notes is fair with the current data but has the potential to change as we learn more about the many forms of life on Earth.“There's a lot of uncertainty,” Bobrovskiy says of studying such ancient life. “But applying biomarkers removes a large part of this uncertainty.”Droser adds: “Coupled with everything else, it is really hard to argue that this wasn't an animal.”Though scientists can't say exactly when the first animal arose, ancient traces hint it was more than 600 million years ago. However, Dickinsonia, with its newly confirmed classification, falls among a group of the oldest animals yet found. Kimberella, an early mollusk-like animal, rivals Dickinsonia in age. So does the worm-like creature that likely left the winding tracks known as Helminthoidichnites.Around 541 million years ago, squishy Ediacarans gave way to the fantastical critters of the Cambrian explosion, trussed up in their spikes and armor.Together, this spectacular array of early life helps us better understand the collection of creatures that now swim, hop, fly, gallop, and waddle around the world. “We're amazed at the diversity of life and how life has adapted to various environments on this planet,” Droser says. “But that's an artifact of the last billion years on this planet of evolution and extinction...and the Ediacara biota is the start of that.",
"On the southeast coast of Newfoundland, near North America’s farthest eastward reach, lies a promontory of rocky cliffs called Mistaken Point. The place got its name from the shipwrecks it helped cause in foggy weather, when sea captains mistook it for somewhere else. Today it represents something quite different: a set of extraordinary clues, recently reinterpreted, to one of the deepest and most puzzling mysteries of life on Earth. After burbling along for more than three billion years as tiny, mostly single-celled things, why did life suddenly erupt into a profusion of complex creatures—multicellular, big, and astonishing? Although these new life-forms spread worldwide, beginning at least 570 million years ago, the earliest evidence of them has been found in one place: Mistaken Point. Paleontologists have been going there for decades. But what the experts think they see now, in small nuances with large implications, is radical and new.On a cool autumn day I made the journey to Mistaken Point myself, driving south from St. John’s, Newfoundland’s capital, in a rented Jeep, along a black ribbon of highway through forests of spruce and fir. With me were Marc Laflamme of the University of Toronto Mississauga and his longtime colleague Simon Darroch, an Englishman based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.We reached Mistaken Point beneath a blue sky and a blazing sun—rare weather, Laflamme told me, but the strong angled light, especially in late afternoon, helped highlight the subtle fossils we had come to see.At the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve, established by the provincial government to protect the fossil beds, we took a gravel road to a broken sea bank and climbed down. Laflamme pointed to a single slab of smooth, purplish gray rock, tilted at about 30 degrees. An image in the stone, like an intricate shadow, suggested the skeleton of a snake, a repeating pattern of ribs and spine, about three feet long. But there was no skeleton here, indeed no bone at all—only the imprint of a soft-bodied creature, dead and buried on the sea bottom a very, very long time ago. It didn’t swim; it didn’t crawl. It couldn’t have lived like any organism alive today. It belonged to a more obscure period, inhabited by cryptic, otherworldly creatures that most people don’t realize ever existed. “This is the first time that life got big,” Laflamme told me as we knelt on the rock.The mystery of these life-forms, known as Ediacarans (Ee-dee-AK-arans), begins in the remote Flinders Ranges of South Australia, where a young geologist named Reginald Sprigg, on an assignment to reassess the derelict Ediacara Mines in 1946, noticed some peculiar impressions in exposed sandstone beds. They seemed to him “suggestive of jellyfish.” They weren’t jellyfish. There were other shapes too, some of them bearing no clear resemblance to any known creature, living or extinct. One figure looked like a fingerprint pressed into the sand.Sprigg didn’t realize (nor did those who had found similar figures in stone before, unsure what to make of them) that the fossils were about 550 million years old—dating to at least 10 million years before a better known evolutionary drama, the famous Cambrian explosion. Scientists until then had believed that the Cambrian explosion was the point when life on Earth opened out, kaboom, like a starburst of wondrous beasts—elaborate and sizable beings (we call them animals), many of whose descendants are still around. Sprigg’s discovery proved important as a first signal that the period now called Ediacaran, not the Cambrian just following it, was where the saga of bigness and complexity began.Then in 1967 a graduate student named S. B. Misra noticed a fossil-rich slab of mudstone at Newfoundland’s Mistaken Point. Some of its ancient forms seemed to match the “jellyfish” things from South Australia, others looked like fronds, but several resembled nothing known to science. Other beds nearby, sitting one upon another like layers of Precambrian cake, also proved to contain abundant and various fossils, preserved together as whole communities. Many were still covered with thin crusts of fallen volcanic ash, like icing between each layer of cake. The ash, with its traces of radioactive uranium and the lead into which that decays, allowed for precise radiometric dating of the beds. The Mistaken Point fossils, going back 570 million years, are the earliest evidence on Earth of large, biologically complex beings.There are now more than 50 different Ediacaran forms known, from nearly 40 localities, on every continent except Antarctica. So what was it, after billions of years of only microbes populating the globe, that allowed the Ediacarans to get big and cover the Earth? And what does their bigness suggest about their internal anatomies, their means of feeding, their ways of living?Before Ediacaran forms flourished on the planet, evolution worked on a mostly microscopic scale, kept in check by a shortage of oxygen, the element that fuels animal metabolism. Thanks to marine bacteria that generated oxygen as a product of photosynthesis, levels of the gas rose about two billion years ago but stayed relatively low for another billion years. Then, between 717 million and 635 million years ago, a series of glaciations took place, so widespread and severe that they may have frozen over the entire planet, a situation some scientists call a “snowball Earth.” During that time oxygen levels bumped up again, for reasons that are still poorly understood.The great freeze ended as volcanic eruptions spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating an early greenhouse effect that warmed the planet and thawed the oceans. Another brief glaciation around 580 million years ago, known as the Gaskiers, may not have been global, but it put Newfoundland, among other places, in a deep freeze. These changes all preceded the earliest appearance of Ediacarans in the fossil record. Were they the causes of what happened next? Did the end of the glaciers, an increase in available oxygen, and the evolution of more complex cells allow the Ediacarans to blossom, like the first crocuses of springtime? Maybe.Phylum Arthropoda: Judging by number of species and sheer abundance, arthropods are hands down the planet’s most dominant phylum, or principal division, in the animal kingdom. Defined by shared features such as tough exoskeletons and segmented bodies, the phylum includes well over a million named species, among them a snapping shrimp, a jungle nymph, an eastern lubber grasshopper, an Australian walking stick, a mantis shrimp, and a gaudy clown crab (in the gallery below). Millions more species are believed to be still unknown to science. Arthropods were the most diverse animal group in the Cambrian period and the Ordovician period that followed. The 452-million-year-old limestone slab shown here captures an Ordovician menagerie, including various echinoderms and trilobites, such as Ceraurus, the turtle-like form on the left edge.Snapping shrimpEqually enigmatic is their relationship to life today. One eminent German paleontologist, Adolf Seilacher, assigned them to a kingdom all their own, distinct from the animal kingdom, because of what he called their “unique, quilted type of biological construction,” so different from most multicellular animals. The “quilted” effect seemed to offer structural stability that might have compensated for the absence of a skeleton. Maybe the quilting, and the frondy shapes, also helped maximize surface area, so they could better absorb nutrients through their skin.Nutrition would have been problematic for the Ediacarans because, so far as fossil evidence reveals, almost none of them had a mouth. They had no gut, no anus. No head, no eyes, no tail. In some cases there was a sort of anchoring knob or disk at one end, now known as a holdfast, which gripped the sea bottom and allowed the frond to waft upward in the water. Many sea-bottom areas at that time were coated with thick microbial mats, which helped stabilize the sediments like a layer of crusty soil. But the frond wasn’t a plant—photosynthesis couldn’t have nourished it—because many Ediacarans lived in the depths, thousands of feet underwater, where light didn’t penetrate.If they couldn’t eat and they couldn’t photosynthesize, how did they nourish themselves? One form, a sluglike thing called Kimberella, may have scratched up and swallowed (this one did have a mouth, major advantage!) sustenance from the microbial mats beneath it. But the leading hypothesis for most Ediacarans is osmotrophy, a fancy word for a very basic process: the uptake of dissolved nutrients by osmosis, or absorption through their outer membrane. It was good enough, maybe, in a simpler world at a simpler time, but it would have been meager sustenance.  Some scientists have focused on another fascinating aspect of many Ediacarans: their finer architecture. At a glance they look quilted, but close inspection reveals that their structure is fractal. That is, similar patterns repeat themselves at progressively smaller scales. A big frond was composed of smaller fronds, and those smaller fronds composed of still smaller fronds, all similar except for size. The basic shape echoes itself at three or four scales. Possibly that fractal structuring helps explain how they were able to grow large. It provided some rigidity, it maximized surface area, and perhaps it reflected a genetic shortcut. A simple formula in the genome might have specified: Build a small frondy unit, then repeat that operation over and over, adding one upon another, to make me big.This sort of fractal structure showed in the snakelike creature Marc Laflamme and I saw in the purplish gray rock at Mistaken Point. It shows too in a number of other Ediacarans, collectively called rangeomorphs, named for a Namibian exemplar of the form, known as Rangea. During our day on the Newfoundland rocks, Laflamme steered my eyes onto many more rangeomorphs, inconspicuous from 10 feet away but spooky when viewed closely. Here was Beothukis mistakensis, a paddle-shaped frond, named for its locale of discovery. Over there was Fractofusus, a spindle-shaped form, tapered at both ends. It lived flat on the sea bottom. When death came to a community of Ediacarans, as when a blizzard of volcanic ash settled through the seawater to smother them or an avalanche of sediment came off a steep slope to bury them, the vertical frondy things sometimes got smashed over (as the fossil evidence shows), but the Fractofusus spindles seem to have died gently where they lay.Phylum Mollusca: Like arthropods, mollusks gained a foothold during the Cambrian period and eventually branched out into a profusion of divergent forms, including a modern lettuce sea slug, chiton, tusk shell, keyhole limpet, and spotted sea hare (shown in the gallery below). Nectocaris pteryx, the 508-million-year-old fossil preserved in the Burgess Shale shown here, sports several features seen today in squid, octopuses, and other creatures in the cephalopod class of mollusks. The shared traits include tentacles, eyes, and below them, a funnel used for propulsion. Most early mollusks lived on the ocean bottom, but Nectocaris had specialized to wander throughout the water column.Lettuce sea slugAlthough these rangeomorphs dominated the deep-sea ecosystem at Mistaken Point for millions of years and flourished elsewhere in somewhat shallower water, they all disappeared, leaving no known descendants. By the start of the Cambrian period 541 million years ago, or soon after, they had almost entirely vanished from the fossil record as we know it. That’s why some scientists have suggested that the Ediacarans represent “failed experiments” in the early evolution of multicellular life.Why did the Ediacarans suddenly disappear? Was the extinction absolute, or were there descendants in different forms? And if the end wasn’t so abrupt and complete, what finished the Ediacarans as Ediacarans, dying off species by species in obscurity?Phylum Mollusca: A defining feature uniting all mollusks ancient and modern is the possession of an outer layer of flesh called a mantle, which in this flame scallop is mottled in scarlet and decked with sticky tentacles. The mantle plays different roles in various species, depending on the creature’s needs. In shelled mollusks like snails, clams, and scallops, it secretes a substance used to make the shell. Squid, octopuses, and cuttlefish propel themselves by filling the cavity beneath their mantle with water and shooting it out through a siphon.Laflamme’s colleague Simon Darroch has offered one possible answer. On the afternoon of our visit to Mistaken Point, Darroch reached into his day pack and produced a surprise: small pieces of flat brown stone from the late Ediacaran beds he studies in Namibia. He had brought them from his lab at Vanderbilt to show me some trace fossils. A trace fossil, as distinct from a body fossil, records traces of animal activity—moving, chewing, defecating—as preserved in rock. It’s a record of behavior, not of bodily shape. Any such traces are notable in the Ediacaran period, because most Ediacarans couldn’t do those things: move, chew, or defecate.“This is a very static, sessile ecosystem,” Darroch said, referring to a famously rich early Ediacaran fossil bed on which we stood.The later Ediacaran, as revealed in Namibian rocks, was much different. One big difference, he said, was that “for the first time we have complex burrowing.” Experts disagree about just when the intricate patterns of burrowing creatures first appeared, but by any judgment those traces signaled a big change from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian. Wormy creatures had long been wriggling along on the sea bottom; now they were tunneling down into it as well. Darroch showed me a little slab marked with dotted-line traces. “They’re on the surface, and they disappear, then they come to the surface again.” That was evidence of an organism with complicated musculature, allowing it to move about in three dimensions. If it moved that way, it had a front and a rear end. On its front end, probably a mouth. In the mouth, maybe teeth. These were extraordinary new tools and capacities at the time. The worms crawled in, the worms crawled out, disrupting the microbial mats, possibly munching directly on Ediacarans. In a recent paper, Darroch and his co-authors (led by James Schiffbauer, and including Laflamme) have called this early Cambrian time the “Wormworld.” It was no place for Ediacarans.Worminess wasn’t the only factor that brought oblivion to the Ediacarans and triggered the Cambrian explosion—there also were changes in ocean chemistry that allowed animals to acquire hard parts (calcium-rich skeletons, teeth, and shells), a generalized increase in modes of mobility (not just burrowing), and the rise of predatory habits, among other things. But the worminess of that transitional time, in the late Ediacaran period, may have played a crucial role. A few weeks after our Mistaken Point outing, I talked with James Gehling, a leading Ediacaran researcher. Go up to the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, near the Ediacara Hills, he told me by phone from his office in Adelaide, and look at the first formation of Cambrian sedimentary layers. “It’s just Swiss cheese.” Burrowed all through by wormy creatures that had churned the sand and “recycled” the soft-bodied Ediacarans. “That’s where the Cambrian begins,” Gehling said. “The advent of the musculature to burrow.”Guy Narbonne, at Queen’s University in Ontario, largely agrees with the importance of burrowing. But together with his graduate student Calla Carbone, he has taken Wormworld a step further. Based on careful analysis of trace fossils from the late Ediacaran and the early Cambrian, Narbonne and Carbone noticed a significant difference in how those wormy creatures turned. By the early Cambrian, burrowing animals became more systematic in their searches for food, as well as more muscled. They ranged more efficiently, tracking the resources better and crossing their own tracks less. “It reflects the evolution of braininess,” Narbonne told me. “Our interpretation,” he added, “is that the Cambrian explosion is when behavior became coded on the genome.” They titled that paper, “When Life Got Smart.”Most experts would agree that smartness, even on a level expressed by a primitive worm, wasn’t a wrench in the Ediacaran tool kit. Those creatures’ genomes may have been coded for fractal repetition—at least in the rangeomorphs, where it yielded a simple sort of complexity—but not for responsiveness to circumstances, or efficiency. Still, it’s a mistaken point to dismiss the Ediacarans as doomed. People made that error with the dodo, when they branded it an emblem of ill-fated stupidity. But the real dodo, Raphus cucullatus, a large, flightless, fruit-eating bird endemic to the island of Mauritius, had thrived in its peaceable home for many thousands of years—until Homo sapiens and other predators arrived. Likewise the Ediacarans, with their own new threats. You can call them “failed experiments” in evolution if you want, but they succeeded and flourished, within their preferred but challenging environments, for more than 30 million years. We humans should be so steadfast and lucky.",
"Paleontologists have found traces of animal life dating back at least 635 million years. Those earliest animals may have been like today’s sponges, rooted to the sea floor and filtering food particles from the water. Over the next 100 million years or so, new kinds of animals emerged. Some were recognizable members of living groups of animals, while others were so bizarre that paleontologists suspect they belonged to long-extinct lineages. And then, around 520 million years ago, the fossil record of animals starts to roar like a firehose switched from a trickle to full blast. Many of the oldest known members of living animal groups–including our own–appear during the Cambrian Period. But the Cambrian fossil record is also rife with forms only distantly related to animals on Earth today, some of which were so weird that the sight of a reconstruction of the creatures made scientists burst out laughing.Many people have become familiar with this period of evolution through Steven Jay Gould’s 1989 influential book, Wonderful Life. In the 24 years since then, scientists have learned a lot more about the Cambrian. Two of the leading experts on the period, Doug Erwin of the Smithsonian Institution and James Valentine of Berkeley have collaborated on a new book, The Cambrian Explosion: The Construction of Animal Biodiversity, in which they synthesize evidence, both old and new, about this exceptional chapter in animal evolution.The so-called Cambrian Explosion probably had many fuses. Erwin and Valentine explain how the Earth was undergoing drastic changes in the millions of years leading up to the flowering of the animal kingdom, with global ice ages and a burst of oxygen flooding the oceans. The stage was set for big, active creatures to evolve. As predators emerged, their prey became better defended with spikes and shields; the predators in turn became even deadlier. The animals changed their environment–burrowing animals, for example, pierced the sea floor with countless tunnels. As the environment changed, new kinds of animals evolved that could occupy new niches. The animal kingdom became both physically and ecologically complex.But the diversity of the Cambrian had another source: the DNA of the animals themselves. Animals evolved genetic programs for turning a single egg into a complex body. These programs turned out to be supremely evolvable–with relatively minor mutations, they could give rise to new forms.The book is also accompanied by some remarkable paintings by Quade Paul. I’ve reproduced some of them here as a slide show, and below.All the pictures in this post are copyright 2013 Quade Paul.(Full disclosure: The publisher of this book, Roberts & Company, also publishes my textbooks, which include some illustrations by Paul.)",
"The city of Tanis is relatively unknown among Egypt's wealth of historical sites, though it yielded one of the greatest archeological troves ever found. Once the capital of all Egypt, Tanis's royal tombs have yielded artifacts on par with the treasures of Tutankhamun.The treasures found in the "lost city" of Tanis rival those of King Tut's. Yet for more than six decades the riches from its rulers' tombs have remained largely unknown.Many who know of Tanis at all remember the city as portrayed in the Indiana Jones movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the famous film the city was buried by a catastrophic ancient sandstorm and rediscovered by Nazis searching for the Ark of the Covenant.In reality, the Ark was never hidden in Tanis, the sandstorm didn't happen, and the Nazis never battled Indiana Jones in the site's ruins. But the true tale of Tanis is also fit for the silver screen.Tanis was known by many names. Ancient Egyptians called it Djanet, and the Old Testament refers to the site as Zoan. Today it's called Sân el-Hagar.The site, in the Nile Delta northeast of Cairo, was capital of the 21st and 22nd dynasties, during the reign of the Tanite kings in Egypt's Third Intermediate period.The city's advantageous location enabled it to become a wealthy commercial center long before the rise of Alexandria. But political fortunes shifted, and so did the river's waters—and in recent centuries the Tanis site had became a silted plain with some hill-like mounds thought to be of little interest.It was known that the ancient city was hidden somewhere in the area, but not where."People kept trying to identify different places with it," said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee.Egypt's "intermediate periods" were times of weak central government when power was divided and sometimes passed out of Egyptian hands. During this time the rulers of Tanis were of Libyan decent, not scions of traditional Egyptian families. That distinction may have contributed to the city's disappearance in later years."It's not like the Valley of the Kings, where everyone knew they'd been burying [pharaohs] for ten generations or so," said David Silverman, an Egyptologist at the University of Pennsylvania.In 1939 a French archaeologist named Pierre Montet brought Tanis into the 20th century after nearly a dozen years of excavations. He unearthed a royal tomb complex that included three intact and undisturbed burial chambers—a rare and marvelous find.The tombs held dazzling funereal treasures such as golden masks, coffins of silver, and elaborate sarcophagi. Other precious items included bracelets, necklaces, pendants, tableware, and amulets.Statues, vases, and jars also filled the tombs, all part of an array that still bears witness, after thousands of years, to the power and wealth of Tanis's rulers.One of the kings, Sheshonq II, was unknown before Montet discovered his burial chamber. But he wore elaborate jewelry that once adorned the more famous Sheshonq I, who is mentioned in the Bible."That shows you that [the kings of Tanis] were very important at least during that time period," Silverman said of the biblical reference.A person standing in the doorway of the Monastery at Petra, Jordan,  shows the enormity of the ancient building's entrance. Carved into the  sandstone hill by the Nabataeans in the second century A.D., this  towering structure, called El-Deir, may have been used as a church or  monastery by later societies, but likely began as a temple.Tanis was found largely as it was abandoned, so the city is home to many archaeological treasures in addition to the tombs. Temples, including a Temple of Amun and a Temple of Horus, have been found. Even urban districts of the ancient city remain, and the site continues to host archaeological expeditions in search of more finds.With so much to discover, how did Montet succeed so spectacularly where others had failed?"It takes somebody who is really persevering to conquer the odds," Silverman said. "Pierre Montet worked very, very hard to finally discover what is referred to in the Bible—what was known from contemporary history but had been lost."But if Montet's achievements were extraordinary, his timing was atrocious. His discovery of Tanis was completely overshadowed by the nearly simultaneous eruption of World War II.Even today, few know the tale of the treasures Montet discovered. And though the objects reside in Cairo's Egyptian Museum, they draw far fewer visitors than their more famous counterparts."Had the Second World War not intervened, the royal burials of Tanis would have been as well, if not better, known that the tomb of Tutankhamun," Ikram notes.",
"King Tutankhamun is one of the most famous rulers who ever lived thanks to the 1922 discovery of the pharaoh’s tomb in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The find stirred the imaginations of millions who were fascinated by the boy king’s golden-masked mummy. (How was Tut's tomb discovered 100 years ago? Grit and luck.)But what do we really know about Tut? Although many details of his reign remain lost to time, historians have spent years trying to piece together the pharaoh’s life and legacy. Here’s what they’ve learned—and the biggest questions that remain.Born during ancient Egypt’s 18th Dynasty—which stretched from 1550 B.C. to 1295 B.C.—Tut began his life under a different name: Tutankhaten.In the years before Tut rose to the throne, Egypt was going through a period of great upheaval. King Amenhotep IV, who is believed to be Tut’s father, had turned away from his culture’s many gods to worship a sun god called the Aten. In honor of the new deity, he changed his own name to Akhenaten and named his son Tutankhaten, meaning “living image of Aten.” (Learn about King Tut with your kids.)But around 1336 B.C., King Akhenaten died after about 17 years on the throne—and nine-year-old Tut ascended to power. The boy king restored the old ways of the kingdom, bringing back its many gods and opening new temples. (See the enduring power of King Tut as never before.)Tut also changed his name to Tutankhamun, which meant the “living image of Amun,” the Egyptian god of the air. He also took on the throne name, Nebkheperure, which was a nod to the old sun god Re. He married a woman named Ankhesenamun, a daughter of Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti. While the couple are not thought to have left any surviving children, two mummified fetuses found in Tut’s tomb were likely their stillborn daughters.The rest of Tut’s short reign was fairly unremarkable. Ruling for only about nine years, Tutankhamun was one of the lesser known pharaohs of his time. Some scholars theorize that royal advisers and priests may have even used the boy king as a puppet to reclaim power for themselves. Others suggest that Tut’s successors removed his name from monuments and records because of his association with the reviled Akhenaten.Technicians use state-of-the-art equipment to scan a wall in King Tut's burial chamber.But there was one upside to that erasure: While most of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings were looted over the centuries that followed, Tut’s was left relatively unspoiled. When its treasures were finally brought to light, they inspired modern investigations into Tut’s life and what it reveals about the time of the pharaohs. (Learn about the mysteries of the Valley of the Kings.)One of the puzzles that has most vexed historians and scientists alike is how Tut died.Theories have abounded ever since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered Tut’s tomb in 1922. Some suspect that he was murdered or died from malaria or another devastating disease. Others have hypothesized that Tut’s chest—which is missing ribs and a sternum—might have been crushed in an accident or fall from his chariot. Still others argue that he likely died an invalid, pointing to evidence of a clubfoot and canes that he may have used to walk. (Discover King Tut's 5,000 treasures, by the numbers.)One thing scholars do know is that Tut was young when he died—still a teenager by most accounts—and his death was unexpected. Tut’s final resting place was in fact an unfinished tomb intended for some other courtier, and evidence suggests that it was prepared for the king’s body in a hurry.It’s unclear whether we will ever fully understand the life of Tutankhamen, the boy king. But his memory continues to captivate the world, centuries after his short reign.",
"The Pyramids of Giza and the Nile Delta were the tombs of choice for pharaohs of Egypt's Old Kingdom. But New Kingdom pharaohs, who wanted to be closer to the source of their dynastic roots in the south, built their crypts in the hills of this barren tract west of Luxor, now called the Valley of the Kings.The ancient Egyptians built massive public monuments to their pharaohs. But they also spent time and treasure creating hidden underground mausoleums.The most famed collection of such elaborate tombs—the Valley of the Kings—lies on the Nile's west bank near Luxor.During Egypt's New Kingdom (1539-1075 B.C.), the valley became a royal burial ground for pharaohs such as Tutankhamun, Seti I, and Ramses II, as well as queens, high priests, and other elites of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties.The tombs evidence elaborate preparations for the next world, in which humans were promised continuing life and pharaohs were expected to become one with the gods. Mummification was used to preserve the body so that the deceased's eternal soul would be able to reanimate it in the afterlife.The underground tombs were also well stocked with all the material goods a ruler might need in the next world. Treasures—like the golden masks found with King Tut—are dazzling, but the tombs also contained the more mundane."They included furniture, clothes (even underwear), and jewelry. It's curious that we have no books—from Tut at least," says Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at American University in Cairo and a National Geographic grantee.Tombs were also well-provisioned with enough food and drink, including wine and beer, for royal feasting in the next world, as well as sacred objects meant to help the deceased achieve eternal life, even favored companions."[We find] pets buried nearby," Ikram says. "Hunting dogs, pet baboons, and gazelles."Tomb robbers, treasure hunters, and archaeologists have been combing the Valley of the Kings for centuries—yet it continues to yield surprises.Many thought that the 62 tombs discovered before 1922 represented all that would be found in the valley—until Howard Carter discovered the resting place of a boy king called Tutankhamun.In 2005, a team led by archaeologist Otto Schaden discovered the valley's first unknown tomb since Tutankhamun's. The site, dubbed KV 63, was found only about 50 feet (15 meters) from the walls of Tut's resting place.KV 63 had no mummy but housed sarcophagi, pottery, linens, flowers, and other materials. Some believe it heralds the presence of another as yet undiscovered tomb."KV 63 is an embalming cache; there must be a tomb to go with it," Ikram says.At least one late Ramesside pharaoh's tomb (Ramses VIII) is still undiscovered, and many believe it may be found within the valley.Clues to such discoveries may be found in period Egyptian writings that mention notables who likely rated tombs but have not been identified."You try to find out what hasn't been discovered, and figure out where they might possibly be, and then look in those areas," said David P. Silverman, an Egyptologist at the University of Pennsylvania. "You never know what you are going to find."But if more tombs are found, will they be as relatively unmolested as Tut's? The odds are against it.Though their entrances were well hidden, nearly all of the valley's known royal tombs were likely robbed before the end of the 20th dynasty—Egyptian records testify to robbers' trials and to the harsh punishments handed down.By the time the Greek writer Diodorus Siculus visited the valley's tombs (circa 60 B.C.) he wrote, "We found nothing there except the results of pillage and destruction."It's possible, perhaps, that any tomb yet to be found was so well hidden that it also escaped the notice of ancient thieves. Only time will tell.",
"Lady Fiona Herbert, the eighth Countess of Carnarvon, turns the folio pages of a leatherbound guest book, pointing out the signatures of illustrious visitors who frequented her famous home a century ago. We are high in Highclere Castle, the grand country estate some 50 miles west of London that in recent years became the setting for the popular period drama Downton Abbey. Now every table, chair, and much of the floor in Lady Carnarvon’s small study is stacked with books and original documents from the 1920s: letters, diaries, and yellowed photographs mounted in albums or rolled up like ancient papyrus scrolls. The guest register contains the cast of characters for a book Lady Carnarvon is writing about her husband’s forebear, George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, the fifth Earl of Carnarvon. “The Fifth Earl,” as she refers to him, famously sponsored British archaeologist Howard Carter in his dogged search for the lost tomb of King Tutankhamun. Lord Carnarvon also hosted lavish parties at Highclere that brought together an eclectic mix of explorers, diplomats, socialites, and—a bit surprising for an English aristocrat—leaders of Egypt’s independence movement.Lady Carnarvon stops at July 3, 1920, and introduces the guests as if she’d been at the soiree herself. “Here is Howard Carter, of course, who spent weeks here each summer planning the excavations with the Fifth Earl … British High Commissioner Lord Allenby … Alfred Duff Cooper and his beautiful wife, Lady Diana Cooper.” She indicates a noble who signs only one name, Carisbrooke—a grandson of Queen Victoria: “A minor member of the royal family, to give the gathering a little street cred.”She points out a series of signatures, some in Arabic script. “And look there … Saad Zagloul, Adly Yeghen, and other fathers of the modern Egyptian state.” Zagloul, a national hero in Egypt, had been arrested and exiled for his opposition to British occupation. Yet here he was, hobnobbing with British bigwigs.“I can see what he was doing, because I do it myself,” Lady Carnarvon says of the earl. “The Fifth Earl was putting people together informally, where they could develop a measure of personal trust, maybe even friendship, before negotiating a treaty or solving a political crisis.”I notice that Zagloul signed his name next to Carter’s and wonder if they conversed about the fate of Egypt’s ancient treasures. Zagloul decried foreign control of Egyptian antiquities as a pernicious form of colonialism—an issue over which he would soon clash with Carter and the archaeologist’s blue-blooded benefactor.Lord Carnarvon began spending winters on the Nile in 1903, on the advice of his doctor. He suffered congenitally poor health, made all the worse by a near-fatal car accident that left him with badly injured lungs. (An avid “automobilist,” Carnarvon owned one of the first cars in England.) Breathing Egypt’s desert air was, he said, like drinking champagne.Soon Lord Carnarvon was relishing Egyptian antiquities as much as Egypt’s air. In 1907 he hired Carter to search for artifacts for his growing collection at Highclere and to supervise the excavations he was funding.Carter had left England for Egypt at 17 with no formal training in archaeology but with marked talent as an artist. He developed a keen eye for artifacts and in 1899 was appointed one of two chief inspectors of antiquities in the Egyptian Antiquities Service.Carter’s fortunes took a sharp turn in 1905, after what he called a “bad affray” with a group of French tourists. (They were drunk and abusive, Carter claimed, although he later admitted to having a “hot temper.”) To avoid a diplomatic incident, his superior told him to express his regrets. He refused, feeling that his only honorable option was to resign, which he did several months later.Carter had been scratching out a living selling watercolors to well-heeled tourists when he was introduced to Lord Carnarvon two years later. The two men stood far apart in the social pecking order, but they shared a passion for ancient Egypt. Their partnership would lead to the discovery of a little-known boy king who had been laid to rest with a staggering store of treasures, then largely forgotten for more than 3,000 years. The find was one of archaeology’s greatest triumphs, offering the world a dazzling vision of ancient life on the Nile and instilling in modern Egyptians a new sense of national pride and self-determination.Important clues to the whereabouts of Tutankhamun’s tomb came to light in the early 1900s in the Valley of the Kings, a complex of rugged canyons across the Nile from modern Luxor, site of the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes. Unlike earlier pharaohs who were interred in towering pyramids that became easy targets for looters, Theban royals were buried in tombs dug deep into the secluded valley’s rocky hillsides.By the turn of the 20th century, the Theban necropolis was Egypt’s most productive and prized archaeological site. Excavations sponsored by Theodore Davis, an American businessman, produced a string of important discoveries. Among them were a few artifacts bearing the name of the mysterious Tutankhamun.Carter had developed an intimate knowledge of the Valley of the Kings during his years as chief inspector. But before he and Lord Carnarvon could start digging there, they had to acquire the excavation permit, called a concession, which was jealously held by Davis.Archaeologists and treasure hunters had been digging in the valley for decades, and many believed the heyday of discovery had come and gone. After years of funding successful excavations, Davis was coming to the same conclusion. “I fear the Valley of the Tombs is now exhausted,” he wrote in 1912. When he relinquished his concession, Lord Carnarvon, at Carter’s urging, snapped it up in June 1914.Later that same month, the assassination of an Austro-Hungarian archduke plunged Europe and the Middle East into World War I, delaying a full-on search for Tutankhamun’s tomb until the fall of 1917, when improving news from the war allowed resumption of excavations. Over the next five years, Carter and a team of Egyptian laborers moved an astonishing 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rubble. The work was hard, dusty, and sweltering under the desert sun.Those five years of pain produced little gain, and Carter’s benefactor grew disillusioned. Perhaps the valley was indeed picked over and played out. In June 1922 Lord Carnarvon summoned Carter to Highclere and announced he was giving up on the valley. Carter pleaded for one more season of digging, even offering to pay for it himself. Lord Carnarvon reluctantly agreed. When Carter arrived back in Luxor on October 28, 1922, the clock was ticking down. Seven days later, a chance discovery lifted his hopes—and soon upended his world.On November 4, a member of Carter’s team whose name is lost to history stumbled upon a carved stone, the top of a buried stairway. In his pocket diary, Carter wrote just five words: “First steps of tomb found.”The next day, the team uncovered 12 steps and descended to a doorway that had been plastered over and stamped with pharaonic seals. The seals were too indistinct to be read but were clearly unbroken. Convinced he’d discovered an intact royal tomb, Carter cabled Lord Carnarvon in England: “At last have made wonderful discovery in valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact ... congratulations.”News of the discovery spread quickly, and reporters raced to the valley to witness the opening of the tomb. Lord Carnarvon arrived on November 23, and by the 24th, Carter and his team had exposed the entire doorway and found seals that were more easily read. Several contained the long-sought-after name: “Nebkheperure,” the throne title of Tutankhamun.Carter and his companions were elated, but a second discovery cast a shadow over the celebration: The doorway bore evidence of forced entry. Someone had been there before them.The door was cut away, revealing not a treasure-filled tomb but a sloping passage filled with rubble. Two more days of digging brought them to the tomb, more than 20 feet underground. Another plastered doorway bore more seals naming Tutankhamun. Carter made a small hole in the masonry, held up a candle, and looked in. In what would become one of the most famous exchanges in the annals of archaeology, an impatient Lord Carnarvon asked, “Can you see anything?” to which Carter replied, “Yes. It’s wonderful.” (See the enduring power of King Tut as never before)The objects he spied were indeed wondrous: golden beds, life-size guardian effigies, disassembled chariots, a richly decorated throne, all in a jumble. Carter wrote later, “At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold—everywhere the glint of gold.”Tutankhamun’s tomb, Carter soon learned, included four rooms, now known as the antechamber, annex, treasury, and burial chamber. The tomb was unusually small for a pharaoh, but the rooms were packed with everything he would need to live like a king for all eternity—some 5,400 objects in all.It was an archaeologist’s dream—and nightmare. Unpacking, cataloging, preserving, and moving the hoard of artifacts—many of which were damaged and fragile—would take a decade of painstaking work and involve an interdisciplinary team of specialists, including conservators, architects, linguists, historians, experts in botany and textiles, and others. The project signaled a new era of scientific rigor in Egyptology.Carter’s friend Arthur “Pecky” Callender, an engineer, built a pulley system to lift heavy objects, installed electric lights, and, when necessary, sat at the tomb entrance with a loaded gun to fend off intruders.Alfred Lucas, a chemist and forensics expert, analyzed the tomb as a crime scene and concluded that two break-ins had occurred in antiquity, soon after Tut was laid to rest. The robbers ransacked some rooms but managed to get away only with smaller, portable items. (Scholars now believe the thieves made off with more than half the royal jewelry.)Harry Burton, who, like Carter, had been an English country lad of modest background, was by 1922 widely recognized as the world’s preeminent archaeological photographer. He set up a makeshift darkroom in a nearby tomb, and his evocative images helped make the discovery and excavation a global media event.Egypt had bewitched its invaders ever since Roman legions conquered the Nile and hauled Egyptian obelisks, hieroglyphs, and deities back to the Eternal City. But the new power of media in a world desperate for diversion after the draining horrors of World War I unleashed a modern wave of Egyptomania that made the boy king a pop-culture celebrity.Soon there were King Tut lemons from California, King Tut cigarette cards and biscuit tins, even a board game called Tutoom in which little metal archaeologists on donkeys searched for treasures. Songs such as “Old King Tut” were Jazz Age hits danced to by flappers wearing cobra headpieces and eye of Horus kohl eyeliner. Egyptian symbols flowed into art deco. Hieroglyphs and cartouches invaded wallpaper, clothing, and furniture fabrics. Egyptian-themed movie theaters opened in some 50 U.S. cities, adorned with gods and sphinxes, papyrus columns, and faux tomb frescoes.When Lord Carnarvon returned to England, he was invited to Buckingham Palace for a personal audience with King George V and Queen Mary, so eager were the royal couple for Tut news. Carnarvon gave the London Times exclusive rights to the unfolding story in return for 5,000 pounds sterling and a percentage of future sales. The deal enraged Egyptian journalists and the international press, whose reporters had to scramble for any scrap of news.Nowhere was Tutmania more powerful than in the pharaoh’s homeland. Egyptians flocked to the Valley of the Kings to see the excavation. Schoolchildren performed plays celebrating the young pharaoh, with props inspired by Burton’s photographs. Political leaders and poets greeted Tutankhamun as a national hero.“He reminds them of their past greatness,” says historian Christina Riggs, “and what their new nation, which only months before had won its independence from Britain, may achieve in the future.”Egyptians saw Tutankhamun’s return to the world as a message from their glorious past. Ahmad Shawqi, the muse of Egyptian independence, addressed Tutankhamun in his poems as the spiritual leader of the Egyptian people. “Pharaoh, the time of self-rule is in effect, and the dynasty of arrogant lords has passed,” Shawqi wrote. “Now the foreign tyrants in every land must relinquish their rule over their subjects!”Egyptians were claiming sovereignty not only over their laws and economy but over their antiquities as well. Archaeology and empire had long been tightly interwoven, with major excavations funded by European and North American museums, universities, and wealthy collectors such as Lord Carnarvon. In return, funders expected to receive up to half the antiquities discovered, in keeping with a decades-old tradition known as partage, from the French partager, “to share.”But Egypt’s new leaders would soon insist that all of Tutankhamun’s treasures were part of Egypt’s patrimony and would remain in Egypt. “The new Egyptian government’s decision to keep the collection of Tutankhamun all in Egypt was an important statement of cultural independence,” says Egyptologist Monica Hanna. “This was the first time that we the Egyptians actually started to have agency over our own culture.”A second great discovery came in February 1923. Carter chipped a hole in the wall of Tut’s burial chamber, held up a flashlight, and peered through. “An astonishing sight its light revealed,” he later wrote, “a solid wall of gold.” The golden wall was, in fact, part of a large, gilded box, or funeral shrine, inside of which were three more shrines and a quartzite sarcophagus. Inside the sarcophagus, Carter would later discover, were three mummy-shaped coffins nested one within the other.Lord Carnarvon joined Carter in the tomb for the much anticipated opening of the burial chamber. Less than two months later, the Fifth Earl was dead from an infected mosquito bite that led to blood poisoning and pneumonia. His sudden demise gave rise to rumors—and many imaginative newspaper articles—of a mummy’s curse that brought death or misfortune to those who disturbed the pharaoh’s resting place. (Meet the mummies you've never heard of.)Undaunted, Carter pressed ahead with the excavation, now supported by Lord Carnarvon’s widow, the Dowager Countess Almina Carnarvon. But when Egyptian authorities began taking a more active role in the excavation, Carter stopped work in protest—spurring his new overseers to bar him from the tomb. It would take nearly a year for him to regain access, and only after he and his patroness had renounced all claims to Tut’s burial goods.When work resumed in 1925, Carter focused on disassembling the nested coffins, a herculean task that required clever engineering. The innermost coffin was made of solid gold and weighed almost 250 pounds. Inside lay Tut’s mummified remains, with a stunning mask of gold covering his head and shoulders—an artifact destined to become the symbol of Egypt’s proud past. Yet the man behind the mask would be slow to give up his secrets.A series of autopsies, x-rays, CT scans, and DNA tests performed over the past century have sought to shed light on Tutankhamun’s parentage, life, and death. Yet time and again, the evidence uncovered points several ways and is open to interpretation.Tut’s father—most likely King Akhenaten—and his mother (whose identity is still debated) were brother and sister, leaving their children vulnerable to genetic defects. In Tut’s case, a congenitally deformed foot may have been the legacy of royal incest—a not uncommon practice in his time and place.His birth name wasn’t Tutankhamun but Tutankhaten, “living image of Aten.” His presumed father—often referred to as the “heretic pharaoh”—had spurned the traditional pantheon of Egyptian gods, Amun supreme among them, and worshipped a single deity known as Aten, the disk of the sun. Akhenaten, “servant of Aten,” shuttered temples, seized the power and wealth of priests, and elevated himself to the status of a living god.After his radical father died, Tutankhaten ascended to the throne at eight or nine years old. He would later oversee a restoration of the old ways—no doubt under the direction of advisers and priests eager to restore their standing. His name became Tutankhamun, “living image of Amun,” and he wed a daughter of Akhenaten andQueen Nefertiti named Ankhesenamun (presumably his half sister). Two mummified fetuses discovered in Tut’s tomb were likely his stillborn daughters.Objects from Tutankhamun’s tomb have led scholars to contradictory conclusions about his short life. Noting the numerous throwing sticks and chariots, some experts have claimed that the young pharaoh led a physically active life of hunting and warfare. Other observers, pointing out the large number of walking sticks and his clubfoot, imagine him as an invalid.Causes of the king’s death proposed over the years have included a chariot accident, a hippopotamus attack, a fatal bout of malaria, and murder. One thing is clear: The young ruler’s death was sudden and unexpected, and his officials had to quickly appropriate a courtier’s cramped, unfinished tomb and round up an ample supply of grave goods, some of which appear to have been made for other royal figures.His successors would try to erase from history nearly every trace of the heretic Akhenaten and his associates, including the birth name Tutankhaten. And so, for Carter and others, searching for the boy king was like chasing a ghost. “The mystery of his life still eludes us,” Carter wrote. “The shadows move but the dark is never quite uplifted.”",
"British archaeologist Howard Carter (left) examines King Tut's sarcophagus in 1922 (tinted photo).Around the world Wednesday, searchers were stumbling upon a gilt- and sepia-toned artifact of the Internet age—a Google doodle heralding the 138th birthday of Howard Carter, the British archaeologist who discovered the ancient Egyptian tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in 1922.The King Tut find brought Carter overnight—and lasting—fame, but it was anything but a stroke of luck, experts say.When talking about the tomb discovery, "everyone likes to use the phrase 'stumble upon,' and that always ticks me off a little bit," said Yale University Egyptologist John Darnell.Carter spent decades as an archaeological excavator exploring burial sites in ancient Thebes (now Luxor) before finding the roughly 3,000-year-old resting place of Tutankhamen, Darnell pointed out. (Take an interactive tour of Tut's tomb.)"Carter found [the tomb] in a methodical way ... He did all the necessary background work," he added. "He didn't simply look for the door of a tomb, but rather he went at it in a way that we would probably characterize today as a form of landscape archaeology."Carter really worked himself into the lives of ancient Egyptian necropolis workmen. He knew the hills, he knew the paths, he knew what happened when rainstorms hit the area"—allowing him to identify the most likely sites for finding long-buried tombs.The Miraculous Marvels of Howard CarterHoward Carter was meticulous in his methodology, agreed Egyptologist David Silverman. "I think he did miraculously," he said, adding that modern archaeologists are still benefiting from Carter's rigor.Carter not only had all of the 5,000-plus artifacts in King Tut's tomb photographed, he also used his training as an artist to sketch them. He knew that "photographs don't always tell everything," said Silverman, of the University of Pennsylvania.Still, Yale's Darnell said, "I believe that some people have periodically made suggestions that Carter didn't do this or that as carefully as he might"—for example, when Tut's mummy, stuck to its sarcophagus by hardened resins and newly vulnerable to looters, refused to budge."No amount of legitimate force could move [the resins]," Carter wrote in his book The Tomb of Tutankhamun. "What was to be done?"Carter exposed Tut's mummy to the desert sun in an effort to melt the resins. When that failed, he cut the corpse free."The mummy is in very bad condition because of what Carter did in the 1920s," archaeologist Zahi Hawass, then head of Egypt's antiquities ministry, told National Geographic magazine in 2005. (See pictures from "King Tut Revealed," National Geographic's report on modern technology's insights into the pharaoh's biology.)Even so, Yale's Darnell said, "Carter did an incredible job."I think the real marvel of Carter is that, in spite of how moved he was by the whole experience, he was able to control himself and go at it in a very methodical way. ... Nothing could be more antithetical to plundering."Penn's Silverman, though, said that if Carter had made his famous discovery today, he might have been a little more careful with the physical evidence because of all of the medical technologies—such as CT scans, MRIs, and DNA studies—now available to archaeologists now."That's one of the few places we might second-guess him," Silverman said.(Related: "King Tut Mysteries Solved: Was Disabled, Malarial, and Inbred.")Carter a Fine "Collection of Curses"When news of the Tutankhamun tomb's discovery spread, Howard Carter became a global celebrity."I think he handled the fame very well," Silverman said. "The most difficult thing that he struggled with was what to do after ... I think that may have plagued him."Carter did work on other tomb excavations afterward, but nothing compared to his 1922 find. Among his regrets were that he eventually became too ill with cancer to finish his full account of the tomb's discovery, according to Yale's Darnell."He did an incredible three-volume initial publication of the material," Darnell added, "but he never got to publish [all] those incredible notes and drawings that he made."Carter died of cancer in 1939, but he never believed his sickness was due to the so-called mummy's curse, or the Curse of the Pharaohs, a supposed death sentence for anyone who disturbed the sleep of Egypt's ancient rulers. "He knew it was a made-up curse," Silverman said—albeit one boosted by the death of Carter's British benefactor, Lord Carnarvon, shortly after the opening of Tut's tomb."Mr. Carter himself, however, was the best refutation of the curse," the New York Times pointed out in its obituary of Carter."Afflicted with bad health from his youth, he spent nearly fifty years in Egypt searching for and exploring the ruins of the tombs of Pharaohs and must have been subject to the finest collection of Egyptian curses in existence."",
"King Tutankhamun is one of the most famous rulers who ever lived thanks to the 1922 discovery of the pharaoh’s tomb in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The find stirred the imaginations of millions who were fascinated by the boy king’s golden-masked mummy. (How was Tut's tomb discovered 100 years ago? Grit and luck.)But what do we really know about Tut? Although many details of his reign remain lost to time, historians have spent years trying to piece together the pharaoh’s life and legacy. Here’s what they’ve learned—and the biggest questions that remain.Born during ancient Egypt’s 18th Dynasty—which stretched from 1550 B.C. to 1295 B.C.—Tut began his life under a different name: Tutankhaten.In the years before Tut rose to the throne, Egypt was going through a period of great upheaval. King Amenhotep IV, who is believed to be Tut’s father, had turned away from his culture’s many gods to worship a sun god called the Aten. In honor of the new deity, he changed his own name to Akhenaten and named his son Tutankhaten, meaning “living image of Aten.” (Learn about King Tut with your kids.)But around 1336 B.C., King Akhenaten died after about 17 years on the throne—and nine-year-old Tut ascended to power. The boy king restored the old ways of the kingdom, bringing back its many gods and opening new temples. (See the enduring power of King Tut as never before.)Tut also changed his name to Tutankhamun, which meant the “living image of Amun,” the Egyptian god of the air. He also took on the throne name, Nebkheperure, which was a nod to the old sun god Re. He married a woman named Ankhesenamun, a daughter of Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti. While the couple are not thought to have left any surviving children, two mummified fetuses found in Tut’s tomb were likely their stillborn daughters.The rest of Tut’s short reign was fairly unremarkable. Ruling for only about nine years, Tutankhamun was one of the lesser known pharaohs of his time. Some scholars theorize that royal advisers and priests may have even used the boy king as a puppet to reclaim power for themselves. Others suggest that Tut’s successors removed his name from monuments and records because of his association with the reviled Akhenaten.Technicians use state-of-the-art equipment to scan a wall in King Tut's burial chamber.But there was one upside to that erasure: While most of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings were looted over the centuries that followed, Tut’s was left relatively unspoiled. When its treasures were finally brought to light, they inspired modern investigations into Tut’s life and what it reveals about the time of the pharaohs. (Learn about the mysteries of the Valley of the Kings.)One of the puzzles that has most vexed historians and scientists alike is how Tut died.Theories have abounded ever since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered Tut’s tomb in 1922. Some suspect that he was murdered or died from malaria or another devastating disease. Others have hypothesized that Tut’s chest—which is missing ribs and a sternum—might have been crushed in an accident or fall from his chariot. Still others argue that he likely died an invalid, pointing to evidence of a clubfoot and canes that he may have used to walk. (Discover King Tut's 5,000 treasures, by the numbers.)One thing scholars do know is that Tut was young when he died—still a teenager by most accounts—and his death was unexpected. Tut’s final resting place was in fact an unfinished tomb intended for some other courtier, and evidence suggests that it was prepared for the king’s body in a hurry.It’s unclear whether we will ever fully understand the life of Tutankhamen, the boy king. But his memory continues to captivate the world, centuries after his short reign.",
"It’s an unusual museum director who wears camouflage clothing and combat boots to work, but Maj. Gen. Atef Moftah isn’t your typical museum director, and the Grand Egyptian Museum isn’t your typical museum. Seen from a distance, the sprawling, postmodern GEM, as it’s called, is so huge that it’s hard to make sense of. Its jutting, prowlike lines resemble an enormous ship run aground in the desert. Closer up, the museum’s exterior is covered in pyramid motifs, echoing the Pyramids at Giza that rise little more than a mile away. The design may be disorienting, but the message is clear: This is a museum fit for a pharaoh.An engineer by training, General Moftah is compact and erect, with close-cropped hair, a swift gait, and a take-charge manner, though his kindly expression and self-effacing humor don’t fit my stereotype of a military leader. Nor does his calm demeanor square with the intense pressure he’s under.The GEM is a signature project of the Egyptian government, a monumental undertaking begun 20 years ago that, because of the Arab Spring uprisings and the COVID-19 pandemic, is many years behind schedule. In a nation highly dependent on tourism revenue, and where archaeology and politics are deeply entwined, General Moftah and his staff are under orders to ensure that the GEM is a resounding success.As we walk across the broad esplanade toward the museum’s entrance, the general gestures toward the towering tombs in the distance, shimmering in the heat. A pedestrian walkway is under construction to link the museum area with the pyramids. “It will be longer than the Champs-Élysées or the Rambla,” he says.Turning to the museum, General Moftah reviews its statistics: 484,000 square feet of floor space, 12 exhibition halls, 100,000 artifacts, total cost of more than a billion dollars. “And we are 99 percent finished!” he declares, clapping his hands in satisfaction.The GEM fits the scale and theatrics of other recent archaeological projects sponsored by the Egyptian government, including the reopening of the Avenue of Sphinxes, in Luxor, and the inauguration of major new museum spaces in Sharm el Sheikh, Cairo, Hurghada, and elsewhere.In April 2021, during a flamboyant, state-sponsored event branded the Pharaohs’ Golden Parade, 22 royal mummies were placed on customized vehicles tricked out to evoke ancient funeral barges. The vehicles moved in grand style from the old Egyptian Museum, through the streets of Cairo, to the new National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. On arrival, they were greeted by President Abdel Fattah el Sisi and received a 21-gun salute.“The mummy parade really helped raise awareness among Egyptians,” says Khaled al Anani, the former minister of tourism and antiquities. “It told us that we all belong to a great civilization, that we respect our ancestors. The Grand Egyptian Museum will send the same messages in powerful new ways: pride, respect, unity, strength.” (Meet the mummies you've never heard of.)Formerly separate entities in the national government, the ministries of tourism and antiquities were merged in 2019—much to the dismay of some Egyptologists, who say archaeology has become tourism’s handmaiden. The GEM also has its critics. Some worry the museum will cater more to foreign visitors and their money than to ordinary Egyptians. Others say the huge structure is ugly—like a graceless series of aircraft hangars—and that it will be dreadfully expensive to cool and illuminate.But as General Moftah and I step out of the fierce sunlight into the museum’s soaring atrium, my doubts fade. The play of light and shadow created by the layered metal mesh roof is dramatic and ever changing. The pyramid motifs that seemed tacky on the exterior are somehow elegant here, variations on an eternal theme. The ceiling rises so high that a statue of Ramses the Great (the leading candidate for the pharaoh of the Bible) seems unremarkable—until you approach close enough to realize that it’s a 36-foot-tall colossus.From the central atrium, broad staircases lined with statues of pharaohs ascend to the 12 exhibition halls. With a laser pointer, General Moftah indicates the shallow pool in the granite floor where cooling water will soon splash. He points to decorative cartouches and squares of golden alabaster on the walls, and explains the avant-garde lighting system.Then he turns and zaps his beam up one of the staircases. “And that is where Tutankhamun lives,” he says. Two exhibition halls are devoted entirely to Egypt’s most famous pharaoh and will display, for the first time, nearly all of the more than 5,000 objects discovered in King Tut’s tomb. When I request a sneak peek, General Moftah smiles and shakes his head. “Out of the question. President El Sisi’s orders. Nobody enters until the inauguration.”I thank the general for his time, then head to the GEM’s state-of-the-art conservation labs, which were the first part of the museum to open in 2010. Priceless pieces from Tutankhamun’s tomb are being cleaned and restored before being put on display.At one station, a conservator is examining the black resin on Tut’s massive outer coffin. At another, Ahmed Abdrabou, an expert in gilded wooden artifacts, is restoring an elegant chariot in elm wood that is a masterpiece of joiner’s art. “For a young Egyptian, it’s such an honor to see many treasures from Tutankhamun’s tomb come through our laboratories,” he says. “Month after month, our heritage passes before me.”Other restorers, mostly women in headscarves and face masks, work at benches around the perimeter of the room. I pause with Manar Hafez, who wears surgical gloves and holds something like a dental tool, and ask about the war shield she’s restoring. As we talk, she gently runs her fingers over the ancient wood, as if caressing a child. “This was like a dead body when I first saw it—all in pieces, no identity,” she says. “Slowly, slowly, I have seen it come back to life. Sometimes it feels like my daughter.”Summer in upper Egypt makes excavating a very unpleasant, even dangerous, business. At 10 in the morning, as I leave the shade of date palms along the Nile and drive into the sun-seared desert beyond, the temperature already is nearing 100 degrees. Yet a team of Egyptian archaeologists is hard at work in the so-called Lost Golden City, an amazingly well-preserved site that is ancient Egypt’s version of Pompeii.Excavation leader Afifi Rohim Afifi guides me down a path that was a bustling city street decades before Tutankhamun’s time. “I almost expect to see an ancient Egyptian turn the corner and walk toward me,” he says. Local workers have helped him decipher features he’s uncovering, such as the matraha, a wooden tool for cooking bread, and the manama, a low-ceilinged room for sleeping. “ ‘We still use these in our village,’ they tell me,” Afifi says. “They feel a strong spiritual connection to this place and want to keep working even after the season ends.”Archaeological projects led by Egyptians have multiplied during the past decade. The shift to local leadership was accelerated by the pandemic, which grounded air travel and halted most fieldwork by foreign archaeologists. Egyptians stepped in to fill the void, and today they lead more than 40 archaeological missions throughout the country.As with the Lost Golden City, many of those sites are producing remarkable discoveries and a wealth of artifacts: 30 painted coffins in Luxor; 40 mummies in Tuna el Gebel, a major necropolis near Minya; and an enormous haul from Saqqara, including 250 painted wood sarcophagi, 150 bronze statuettes, and scores of mummies and statues of cats, mongooses, crocodiles, and ibises.Egyptian authorities are proud of this spate of discoveries and the media attention it’s attracted. Every new find is free publicity for Egypt and its travel industry, says Zahi Hawass, the former minister of antiquities.Some Egyptologists are less enthusiastic, however. “Right now, all the stress is on gold, on treasures, on secrets, and on people in Indiana Jones hats, all of which appeal to the Western audience,” says Monica Hanna, acting dean of the College of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage at the Arab Academy in Aswan. “This is treasure hunting, not real scientific archaeology.”Even so, Hanna echoes the glowing comments I heard from Khaled al Anani and other officials about the parade of royal mummies and the interest it has stirred among Egyptians.“Thousands and thousands of Egyptians contacted us, asking for books on ancient Egypt,” Hanna says. “People were eager to learn more about their ancestors. But there are no books in Arabic on the pharaohs, or even on Tutankhamun. So, in a way, most Egyptians feel estranged from their past. How can they fully understand and engage with their history when they can’t access the knowledge about it?”A 15-minute drive from the Lost Golden City takes me to the Valley of the Kings, site of Tutankhamun’s tomb. More of Egypt’s new generation of archaeologists are at work here, and Zahi Hawass has invited me to meet his team of young excavators. When I arrive, Fathy Yaseen and his colleagues usher me into a tomb they’re using as a workshop and storage area. They show me the 700 amulets, statuettes, and ostraca, each carefully cataloged, that they’ve unearthed recently in deposits near Tutankhamun’s tomb. As we talk, they remember their more spectacular finds of the past and muse about what the coming season may bring. Then they walk me toward the stairs leading down to Tutankhamun’s tomb.“Whatever we find, it probably won’t be like this,” Yaseen says with a wry smile.Descending the 16 steps, the desert heat and brilliance fading to a memory, it’s hard not to hear the footfalls of history: Tut’s burial party; the tomb robbers; Howard Carter and George Herbert, the fifth Earl of Carnarvon; the throngs of visitors drawn here over the past century. At the bottom, I pass through the remains of the wall Carter and Lord Carnarvon broke down on that fateful day a century ago and stand in the first of the tomb’s four rooms, which Carter called the antechamber. The wall frescoes are still bright, despite some discoloration caused by long-dead microbes. On the north wall, Tut is embraced by Osiris, god of the underworld. To the south, the goddess Hathor holds an ankh, symbol of life, to Tut’s lips.Once, parts of this tomb were packed so densely with splendid objects that the excavators had to dangle from ropes attached to the ceiling to avoid trampling them. Now all those artifacts reside in the GEM, some 400 miles away. The one exception is the hulking sarcophagus carved from a single block of quartzite, which once contained Tut’s three nested coffins. At almost five feet tall and weighing untold thousands of pounds, the sarcophagus evidently was too much trouble to remove. Four stone goddesses stand at the corners, wrapping their graceful wings protectively around it. Nothing else remains of Tut’s treasures.Tutankhamun’s mummy is still here, however. Tucked away in a corner of the tomb, in a climate-controlled glass box, the young king lies beneath a white coverlet. His face, wizened by the ages, is a far cry from the golden death mask he once wore, with its iconic, self-assured smile, sly as the Mona Lisa.For the field of Egyptology, this tomb represents a unique resource. As an icon of ancient Egypt, a symbol of the current government, and a magnet for hard currency, Tut possesses star power that remains undimmed. Yet the boy king seems forlorn here in this tomb, stripped of his treasures, deprived of all that ancient Egyptians believed he would need in the afterlife.Still, Tutankhamun would probably be pleased at how his saga is playing out. Egyptians believed that a person’s being was composed of many layers, each of which fared differently in the next world. The khat, or physical body, was thought eventually to decompose to dust, despite elaborate mummification rites. The ba was the deceased’s unique character or personality, often depicted as a falcon with a human head. The ka was the life force that required food and drink after death.A particularly important layer was the ren, or name. The Egyptians obsessively repeated the names of their famous dead in inscriptions, prayers, spells, and funerary text, believing that by doing so the deceased was in some sense revived. If the name was forgotten, the dead person’s soul would be lost for eternity—a much feared second death.Down here in Tutankhamun’s tomb, his khat has seen better days, and about his ba and ka, I can’t say for sure. But his ren is sitting pretty. No pharaoh has been named as often and as joyfully over the past hundred years as Tutankhamun. It seems a safe bet that the boy king who once was a historical footnote will live forever in our imaginations.",
"When I returned to Egypt in June for the first time in 15 years, I struggled to recognize it. In Cairo, alongside the Nile River, the first mile of a promenade called the Mamsha Ahl Misr (“walkway of the Egyptian people”) had just opened, affording sweeping views of the famed waterfront. The sprawling nearby neighborhood known as the Maspero Triangle was in the middle of a drastic face-lift. Run-down sections had been razed, and pricey riverside condos will take their place—part of a plan to demolish 357 residential areas throughout Egypt’s 27 governorates. Hundreds of houses on Warraq, a small island in the Nile, have been bulldozed to make way for hotels. The river’s storied houseboats were being dismantled or towed off one by one.Departing the city on the Tahya Masr Bridge—the world’s widest cable-stayed span, opened in 2019—I traveled north through a welcoming green burst of farmland before reaching the desert around Alexandria. The roadways were so new the asphalt was sticky; the main exits to towns under construction on the coast were yet to be completed. A posh beach resort to the west of Alexandria, New El Alamein, arose from the shore of the Mediterranean just four years ago. With a projected price tag of $60 billion, it will eventually include three universities and a presidential palace. An upscale area called the Latin Quarter was offering four-bedroom seaside “chalets” for as little as a quarter million dollars.Returning to Cairo, I headed east to a satellite city, New Cairo, replete with shiny office towers and plush restaurants, most of which had sprung up since my previous visit from what had been the emptiness of the Eastern Desert. The city projected a sedate affluence, far more akin to suburban Dallas than to the clamorous pulse of historic Cairo.Another half hour farther east, along a not yet fully paved highway, the New Administrative Capital sprawled before me. Still lacking a permanent name, with only a fraction of its projected population of six million living there, the city being built nonetheless lies at the heart of Egypt’s ambitious modernization plans. In a year’s time, perhaps less, what also had been nothing but desert will shimmer with thousands of new residences.The spectacle will seem discordant with the everyday chaos that is Cairo. Here, everything will be orderly and polished—and gigantic: the tallest office building in Africa, the continent’s biggest mosque and biggest cathedral, a public gathering area twice as long as New York City’s Central Park. There will be plenty of diversions too: museums, restaurants and shopping malls, a sumptuously marbled opera house, and a library collection of more than five million books. Visiting Cairo and the beach resorts from here will seem effortless, thanks to a new high-speed rail system. (Egypt’s new billion-dollar museum is fit for a pharaoh)In this Oz-like urban miracle, one rather idiosyncratic building, already finished, stands out: Egypt’s Capitals Museum. As the name suggests, the museum celebrates cities that have been the seat of government during the country’s 5,000 years of recorded history.For simplicity’s sake, the exhibits focus on the six most consequential capitals: the first, Memphis, just south of Cairo; Thebes, the ancient dominion of the pharaohs; Tell el Amarna, Egypt’s birthplace of monotheism; Alexandria, namesake of Alexander the Great; Cairo under Islamic influence; and the modern era’s urban Cairo, under Ottoman and British rule until independence in 1922. Implicit in this narrative of Egyptian history is the argument that relocating one’s capital constitutes a momentous but also somewhat customary turn of events.Indeed, Egypt hardly stands alone in having done so recently. In 1960, the Brazilian government relocated from Rio de Janeiro on the southeastern coast to a more central site in the savanna heartland, creating Brasília from scratch in 41 months. Four decades later, to relieve congested Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia moved its administrative and judicial offices two dozen miles south, to Putrajaya. In 2019, the president of Indonesia declared his intention to create a new capital on Borneo to relieve the population pressures in Jakarta, which is slowly sinking because its wells pump out too much groundwater. Each of these countries used the relocation as an opportunity to create a modern urban showcase for the world to admire.As to why Egypt has elected to do so, the Capitals Museum offers a clue. In addition to hulking marble likenesses of historic Egyptian rulers displayed prominently on the first floor, a life-size bronze statue of President Abdel Fattah el Sisi stands in solitude on the second floor. The statue is easy to miss, in that it doesn’t loom from a great pedestal and is away from the pedestrian flow. Still, its presence is an indication that Egypt’s authoritarian leader has tied his legacy to the founding of a new capital. Also telling is how El Sisi is depicted facing outward, toward his creation—attentively presiding over how contemporary Egypt will be shaped and how its story will be told.El Sisi’s audacious plan—one that he inaugurated in 2015 without first addressing the public, much less putting the matter to a referendum—to relocate the seat of government, embassies, and the entire financial district out into the desert some 30 miles east of Cairo has been set in motion. About a tenth of the government workforce already resides in the New Administrative Capital; the president may move to the new presidential palace there at the end of next year. This government-induced mass migration is part of El Sisi’s greater remaking of Egypt, which involves relocating millions of citizens to newly constructed cities and developing an elaborate transportation network that will connect residents from Cairo to agricultural districts in the Nile Delta and all the way to the Mediterranean coast, 150 miles away.In one sense, El Sisi’s decision to move the capital from Cairo—the seat of government for more than a thousand years—was born of the sober recognition that the city is a ticking time bomb, unable to accommodate its 20 million inhabitants, much less the four million who commute in and out daily. “Our number one goal was to relieve the overcrowding and the traffic,” Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who was overseeing the development at the time of my visit, told me as we sat in his office, situated among the government ministries in the new capital. “Egypt’s population is growing by two million every year. Construction and expansion all over the country is essential.”But with a smile, Abdeen also reminded me: “We are the builders, from ancient times, 5,000 years.” Basic to the identity of Egypt’s 106 million people, as its new capital reminds us, is civilization building—not just once but many times over.The apparition I beheld when I arrived in the new capital was more supersize construction zone than functioning city, requiring some exertion of the imagination. The St. Regis Almasa, where I stayed, is still the only hotel. Connected to it by a long pedestrian skyway is the City of Arts and Culture, a stupefying and mostly completed 127-acre array of manicured gardens, grand performance halls, art galleries, and artist studios. Otherwise, the eerie silence in the desert city, broken intermittently by the growling of construction machinery, underscored the project’s degree of difficulty.Just a few freshly planted trees stood in the arid vastness that eventually will be the Central Park. Its boutiques had yet to open. The elevated guideways for the monorail lurched over the dusty streets like concrete skeletons. The shells of handsome residential communities with international-sounding names such as El Patio Oro, La Verde, and Celia stood vacant in rows. The 77-story ebony Iconic Tower was without tenants or, for that matter, appliances and finished walls. Taking the construction crew’s creaky elevator to the 52nd floor, I had a clear vantage of the new capital’s planned districts—for businesses, for diplomats, for parliament, for the government’s ministries, and for the president. Somehow, by the end of the decade, this view would also encompass millions of residents.For now, the capital dwellers consist principally of construction workers, thousands of whom are Chinese, since China’s state-owned construction firm is the contractor for the Iconic Tower. The Egyptians have unsurpassed experience when it comes to building monumental capitals, but this time around they have chosen to solicit assistance. A French company will manage the electrical network, while a German one will operate the water and sewage systems. “We’re using all kinds of foreign expertise, without any shame,” Abdeen said.The project, though, has suffered some setbacks. Not long after we spoke, Abdeen resigned, ostensibly for health reasons but amid reports of costly flaws in some of the buildings.The government has revealed few details about the construction, including where all the money is coming from for this building boom, except to insist that it won’t cost Egyptian taxpayers anything. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested significantly—and indeed, the city’s main thoroughfare is named Mohammed bin Zayed Road, after the U.A.E.’s president.For that matter, the gleaming postmodern cityscape of the New Administrative Capital will seem aesthetically familiar to anyone who has visited Dubai. Still, the city’s designers have taken some pains to reflect Egyptian history. At the entrance of the City of Arts and Culture, an obelisk from the reign of Ramses II has been moved from the earlier capital city of Tanis to this one, in newly restored condition. It’s impressive but pint-size in comparison with the soon-to-be-constructed Oblisco Capitale. At one kilometer in height, it will be the tallest tower in the world. In the lobby of the Drama Hall, large images of pharaohs playing senet, a precursor to chess, and enjoying musical performances remind visitors that familiar aspects of contemporary culture took root here. And when I peeked into the 1,200-seat concert hall to view its organ—the largest in the Middle East, of course—I was informed by my tour guide that the pipe organ was invented in Alexandria.My guide for the City of Arts and Culture happened to be its senior engineer, Ahmed el Daly. Having overseen its construction since shortly after excavation began in January 2018, El Daly considered it a point of pride that the outside world knew next to nothing about the building crew’s prodigious labors. “Thirteen thousand workers, all of them with phones—yet no photos!” he said with relish. “We have a saying: Work in silence, and let the success do the talking.”Of course, the other reason to work in silence in the new capital is that its entire construction is taking place under the supervision of the Ministry of Defense. There are security implications to any development project that involves the seat of government, but it can be fairly said that the administration of El Sisi—Egypt’s former minister of defense, who took power in 2013 by means of a coup—seeks to maintain a firm grip on how the country is portrayed. The president’s press officials energetically sought to control how this story would depict Egypt. I was not permitted to wander the new city unescorted.That same heavy hand also has sought to project an image of enlightenment and tolerance—decreeing, for example, that the new capital’s Al Fattah Al Aleem “mega-mosque” open on January 6, 2019, the same day the city’s 9,200-capacity Cathedral of the Nativity was inaugurated.Egypt’s new smart city will emphasize green energy and cashless payment systems. And it will be a resolutely crime-free one—with a government protected from protests like those in 2011 that toppled Hosni Mubarak’s regime—courtesy of a citywide surveillance system designed by the U.S. firm Honeywell.Most of all, the New Administrative Capital will be full of life, if not necessarily by choice. A huge number of Cairenes will have their lives upended. “My cousin is a nurse who was forced to go work in its new hospital,” a 56-year-old woman who identified herself by her Arabic nickname, Umm Abdu, told me. “It’s a very hard commute for her.”We were sitting in her fast-food shop in the Bulaq district of old Cairo, a bustling hub of secondhand-clothing stands and makeshift auto-repair shops. Within the next few years, Bulaq will be demolished and most of its inhabitants relocated to new, fully furnished, free housing units in the Al Asmarat projects several miles away. Already, Umm Abdu’s shop had been chased out of one swiftly razed neighborhood, although the government had compensated her. “The new places look quite nice,” she said. “But take a look around—we’re in the heart of the city. Everything I could want is here.”To Umm Abdu and other natives of Cairo, the thousand-year-old city was anything but disordered. Its pedestrian maelstrom and cluttered streets were thoroughly comprehensible, the result of an organic agglomeration that had outlived a succession of autocrats and was therefore a thriving governing force of its own. It was not Riyadh. Cairo’s character was both welcoming and confounding, a spirited tempest of humanity, an irreplaceable feat of architecture. A visitor like me could not help but be awed by it.Umm Abdu considered the new look of her country. “I can’t believe this is Egypt,” she said. “It seems more like Europe.”Deeper into the neighborhood, I encountered two middle-age sisters, Magda and Fattem, who tended a tiny grocery store where residents dropped by throughout the day to grab whatever they needed and returned at midnight to pay their bills in cash. Suspicious of the media in a country that does not exactly embrace the virtues of a free press, they declined to tell me their last name, but Fattem poured me some tea, and they described with chagrin how Bulaq had changed.“Slums are all behind this building,” Magda said. “They’re built out into the alleys so that you can reach out your window and shake your neighbor’s hand. There are drug dealers and pickpockets with knives. Dirty, dirty.”Despite having lived in the neighborhood all their lives, the sisters viewed its imminent destruction as a blessing.“It has to be done,” Fattem said. “Just like the new capital. It will clear out the traffic. Life will be so much easier.”But, I asked, would all this newness rob Egypt of its allure?“Never,” said Fattem, as her sister nodded. “Here is the origin. Here is the history. It will always be here.”",

Sign up here.By Debra Adams Simmons, HISTORY Executive EditorThe mummies of 22 pharaohs and royals were moved Saturday from their display cases in the century-old Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo to a new home. Officials seized the opportunity to put them in the spotlight, turning their five-mile trek to the new National Museum of Egyptian Civilization into a gala parade. The spectacle was part of a larger effort to showcase Egypt’s storied past and stimulate post-pandemic tourism.Dubbed the “Pharaohs’ Golden Parade,” the procession (pictured below) included dancers, mounted guards, dramatic music, newly-commissioned murals along the route, and a light show. Each of the mummies had its own float designed to evoke the royal barges that carried the pharaohs of old to their tombs. The guests of honor included Ramses II, often styled “the Great” and portrayed as the pharaoh mentioned in the biblical Book of Exodus. Also Hatshepsut, an accomplished builder, forceful leader, and one of ancient Egypt’s few female pharaohs. Also paraded: A decade-long ruler, Seti I (pictured above).This wasn’t the mummies’ first road trip, however. As writer Tom Mueller reports, the royals were moved from their original tombs thousands of years ago to protect them from grave robbers. Then, in the late 1800s, they were transported up the Nile on steamships to take up residence in Cairo museums. Ramses even flew to Paris for a makeover in 1976.Many Egyptians enjoyed the parade as a moment of festivity amid the trials of the pandemic. But others worry that the mummy migration has brought bad luck. A recent fatal train wreck in central Egypt, a building collapse in Cairo, and the bizarre blockage of the Suez Canal all have been blamed on a modern-day mummy’s curse connected to the parade.But archaeologist Zahi Hawass, formerly head of Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities, dismisses the notion.“There is no such thing as a curse,” he laughs, “just a lot of superstitious people.”Do you get this daily?

"Escorted by Egyptian film stars, singers, dancers, and guards on high-stepping horses, the mummies of 22 pharaohs and other ancient royalty will be paraded through the streets of Cairo on Saturday, moving from the historic Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to their new home in the recently inaugurated National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC).Dubbed “The Pharaohs’ Golden Parade,” this made-for-TV extravaganza along the Nile is designed to celebrate Egypt’s rich heritage and lure visitors back in the wake of a pandemic that has brought global travel to a standstill.“This parade will make all Egyptians proud of their country,” says archaeologist Zahi Hawass, the nation’s former minister of antiquities. “In a time of COVID, they want to be happy, to feel proud of their ancestors. They will be waiting in the streets to say hello to their kings.”Most of the mummies date from the New Kingdom (about 1539 B.C. to 1075 B.C.), a golden age of Egyptian civilization. They include 18 pharaohs and four other royals ranging in stature from some of Egypt’s most storied leaders to little-known figures.The royal celebrities include Ramses II—often styled “the Great” and portrayed as the pharaoh mentioned in the biblical Book of Exodus—as well as Hatshepsut, an accomplished builder, forceful leader, and one of ancient Egypt’s few female pharaohs. (Discover the truth behind Egypt’s female pharaohs and their power.)Less fortunate rulers among the mummies include Siptah Akhenre, who died in his teens and may have suffered from polio, and Seqenenre Ta, whose savage wounds were made by a battle axe, a dagger, a staff, and a spear, according to scholars who CT scanned his mummy.Other pharaohs had different charms. "Seti I is probably my favorite,” says Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University of Cairo. “He had great taste—and he was dashingly handsome.”The procession will begin around sunset with a 21-gun salute as the royals take to the road at Tahrir Square. Proceeding along a five-mile route that parallels the Nile, the mummies will pass murals of pharaonic scenes against a backdrop of fireworks and sound-and-light shows.“The mummies will be transported in protective cases nested one inside the other, like ancient coffins or Chinese boxes,” says Ikram, who was consulted on the move because of her expertise in mummies and the mummification process. “They should travel in complete security.”The hermetically sealed, climate-controlled cases will be loaded onto military flatbed trucks decorated to look like the funerary barges that once carried deceased pharaohs to their tombs. On their arrival at the NMEC, they will be greeted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and other dignitaries. (See 25 captivating photos of Egypt.)This is hardly the mummies’ first road trip, however. Soon after they were laid to rest in lavish tombs in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor some 3,000 years ago, most of the mummies were transferred to secret caches to protect them from tomb robbers. The caches were rediscovered in the late 1800s—sometimes with help from local looters —and the mummies continued their peregrinations, sailing up the Nile on steam ships to take up residence in Cairo museums.In 1881, a journalist evoked the atmosphere of one such river cruise, as local villagers lined the riverbanks to mourn the departure of their illustrious dead: “Women with disheveled hair running along the banks and shrieking the death wail.  Men ranged in solemn silence and firing their guns in the air, greeted the Pharaohs as they passed.”(On arrival in Cairo, the royals encountered a roadblock when customs officials failed to find “mummy” on the list of goods allowed to enter the city. The officials eventually changed their labels from “mummy” to “salted fish” and let the pharaohs pass.)Since that eerie river journey, the 22 mummies have occupied four different museums, some displayed in glass cases, others in locked storerooms out of the public eye. Ramses II even flew to Paris in 1976 for restoration.It was Ramses’ trip to France, in fact, that inspired the current Minister of Antiquities, Khaled el-Anani, to stage a gala parade. As a child in a French language school in Cairo, El-Anani watched a film of Ramses’ arrival in Paris.“I was amazed to see the crowd of reporters and television cameras at the Paris airport who welcomed Ramses as a president or a king,” El-Anani says. So when he became minister, he decided to “do something big, to organize an unrivaled parade to show the respect for our ancestors, who are also part of mankind’s cultural heritage.”Many Egyptians look forward to the parade as a moment of festivity during the trials of the pandemic. But others worry that this mummy migration has brought bad luck.A recent fatal train wreck in central Egypt, a building collapse in Cairo, and the bizarre blockage of the Suez Canal all have been blamed on a modern-day mummy’s curse connected to the parade. Hawass, the archaeologist, dismisses the notion. “There is no such thing as a curse,” he laughs, “just a lot of superstitious people.” (Judicial power flowed from pharaohs—even after death.)More seriously, the evening pageant comes amid a global discussion over the ethics of exhibiting human remains. Many museum curators are pushing to cover up mummies or remove human remains from display entirely.Egyptian authorities have debated the matter for decades. In 1974, when Hawass accompanied Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth’s sister, on a tour of the Egyptian Museum, she flinched and covered her eyes on seeing the grim, desiccated form of Ramses II. “It was as if she was thinking, ‘Man, why are you doing this? I can’t stand looking at the face of a human being like this!’” Hawass remembers.But now the Egyptian royals will receive the respectful burial they deserve in their new exhibit at the NMEC, Minister El-Anani says.“You descend a ramp as if you are going to the nether world. The walls are black, with very low lighting. Each room is like a burial chamber, where the mummies lie in their coffins, surrounded by their grave goods.”Before enjoying their eternal repose in the NMEC, however, the 22 mummies are starring in a larger-than-life production worthy of Cecil B. DeMille. What might they have to say about taking part in such an event?“Rulers wished to be remembered, for their names to live forever,” says Gregory Mumford, Associate Professor of Archaeology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Thus a state and public acknowledgement of their names, reigns, and identities would, I assume, have appealed to many if not all.”Reporting contributed by Andrew Curry.",
"What makes a king mighty? Ramses II (ca 1303–ca 1213 B.C.) recognized that diplomacy and an exhaustive public relations campaign could mitigate any military shortcomings. His celebrated building accomplishments, including the marvels at Karnak and Abu Simbel, reflected his vision of a great nation and of himself as the “ruler of rulers.” He erected more monuments and statues—and sired more children—than any other pharaoh. As a result, he has long been regarded by Egyptians as Ramses the Great and his 66-year reign is considered to be the height of Egypt’s power and glory.A stone carving of Ramses II in a temple at Garf Husein.It was Ramses II’s grandfather—Ramses I—who had elevated their commoner family to the ranks of royalty through his military prowess. Ramses II’s father, Seti I, secured the nation’s wealth by opening mines and quarries. He also fortified the northern frontier against the Hittites, a tribe out of modern-day Turkey. When 14-year-old Ramses II ascended the throne, the Hittites saw an opportunity to test the young king and his empire’s northern border. They invaded and took over the important trading town of Kadesh in modern-day Syria.Ramses II led his forces to recapture Kadesh, but he was duped by spies into thinking the Hittites were far from the Egyptian camp. Instead, they were lying in wait nearby and attacked. The Egyptians were on the brink of defeat when reinforcements arrived just in the nick of time. Ramses II won that battle but he did not win the war. (Was Ramses II the Pharoah who challenged Moses?)His battered troops withdrew from Kadesh, but Ramses wasn’t about to let a little truth tarnish his perceived triumph. On temple walls across Egypt, he ordered the creation of murals depicting him single-handedly defeating the aggressors. In reality, after years of negotiation, Ramses II eventually signed a peace treaty with the Hittites. It was the earliest peace accord whose text has survived. Among its articles, both sides agreed to extradite refugees and not exact retribution after their return. Further, they agreed to aid one another if attacked by foreign or domestic enemies. One copy of the treaty, in hieroglyphics, was carved on a stela in the temple of Karnak. A second copy, written in Akkadian on a clay tablet, was discovered in Turkey in 1906. The significance of this peace treaty is reflected in the fact that a replica of the tablet is on display at the United Nations headquarters in New York.As a sign of diplomatic good faith, Ramses II married the eldest daughter of the Hittite king. She joined him, Nefertari (his chief queen), and his enormous family—he sired more than a hundred children—at his new capital, Per Ramessu, aptly, though audaciously, named after himself. (See inside the wedding of Ramses II and the Hittite princess.)The wealth of Ramses II’s reign is evident in his opulent building campaign, the largest undertaken by any pharaoh. The temples at Karnak and Abu Simbel are among Egypt’s greatest wonders. His funerary temple, the Ramesseum, contained a massive library of some 10,000 papyrus scrolls. He honored both his father and himself by completing temples at Abydos.For all of Ramses II’s efforts to ensure his legacy would live on, there was one testament to his power he could not have foreseen. After his death, nine subsequent pharaohs took his name upon ascending the throne, solidifying his stature as “the great” among Egypt’s rulers. (Read why the mummy of Ramses II was issued a modern passport.)Ramses II wanted there to be absolutely no question which pharaoh had built the magnificent temple at Abu Simbel. At its entrance, four 60-plus-foot-tall seated statues of him serve as sentries. Dedicated to the sun gods, the temple extends 185 feet into its cliff via a series of three towering halls. Scenes depict Ramses II at the Battle of Kadesh as well as the pharaoh and his principal wife, Nefertari, making offerings to the sun gods. Ramses ordered a second, smaller temple built nearby for Nefertari.Because of its remote location, Abu Simbel went undiscovered until 1813. In 1959, when the construction of the Aswan High Dam threatened to flood the site, UNESCO embarked on an unprecedented, 20-year rescue effort that relocated both Abu Simbel temples—stone by stone—to higher ground some 200 feet farther up the cliff.Among the more than 100-plus offspring of Ramses II, Prince Khaemwaset truly stands apart. He held the prestigious post of high priest of Ptah, the patron god of Memphis. Bas-reliefs depict him in his important duty of tending the tomb of Ptah’s sacred Apis bulls in the underground complex known as the Serapeum.Khaemwaset’s larger legacy is his groundbreaking role as one of the first known archaeologists. He was entranced by the thousand-year-old landmarks from the Old Kingdom that surrounded him in Memphis. He inspected and restored several temples and pyramids. At each restoration, he inscribed the names and titles of the building’s original “owners,” as well as his and his father’s names. A millennium after his death, he was revered as a scholar and featured in a series of stories about his accomplishments.",
"In his 19th century painting, Lourens Alma-Tadema depicts the Pharaoh after losing his firstborn son to the final plague described in Exodus.The Egyptian king is the principal villain of the Exodus story. Unlike the pha­raoh who knew Joseph, the pharaoh of Moses is cruel and vindictive. When Moses asks him to release the Israelites, Pharaoh makes the slaves work harder, depriving them of straw to make sun-dried mud bricks, even though the daily quota of finished bricks must remain the same (Exodus 5:7-8).Learn how the Pyramids at Giza were built.The identity of Pharaoh in the Moses story has been much debated, but many scholars are inclined to accept that Exodus has King Ramses II in mind. The Bible confirms that the Israelites were to build “supply cities, Pithom and Ramses, for Pharaoh.” Egyptian records confirm that the kings of the 19th dynasty (ca 1293–1185 B.C.E.) launched a major mili­tary program in the Levant. As part of this effort, King Seti I (ca 1290–1279 B.C.E.) built a new garri­son city, which his successor, Ramses II (ca 1279– 1213 B.C.E.), later called Pi-Ramesses. Ramses II also built a second city dedicated to his personal patron, Atum, called Per Atum. These two cities are quite possibly the biblical Ramses and Pithom.Read how female pharaohs ruled ancient Egypt.The Egyptian origin of the story is also empha­sized by the name of “Moses.” The Book of Exodus says that his name is derived from the Hebrew verb moshe, which means “to draw out.” However, mose or moses is also a very common Egyptian patronymic, as in Tutmoses, meaning “son of Tut.”Finally, the very first reference to “Israel” appears on the Victory Stela of Pharaoh Merneptah, one of Ramses’ sons. This monument is dated around 1207 B.C.E., which suggests that the Exodus story must be set in a time period prior to the reign of Merneptah, possibly between 1280 and 1220 B.C.E. No record of the exodus has been found in any Egyptian tablets, but that is not unusual; the new dynasty did not make a habit of recording its defeats. On the other hand, there are ample records of Semitic immigrant workers in Egypt, who may have drifted back to Syria-Canaan in the 13th century for a variety of reasons—including, perhaps, Ramses’ harsh poli­cies of conscripting labor.",
"The heat is merciless among the barren hills of the Judaean desert near the shore of the Dead Sea.But it’s mercifully cool inside the cave where Randall Price lies on his stomach, staring at the crevice where just yesterday he discovered a 2,000-year-old bronze cooking pot.“This cave was robbed by Bedouins maybe 40 years ago,” explains Price, an American archaeologist and research professor at Liberty University in Virginia. “Fortunately for us, they didn’t dig very deep. Our hope is that if we keep digging, we hit the mother lode.”Anyone who’s heard of these famed caves near the ancient Jewish settlement of Qumran knows what mother lode Price has in mind. In 1947 young Bedouin goat herders peered into a nearby cavern and made one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century: seven rolled parchments covered in ancient Hebrew script, the first of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls. Members of the separatist Qumran sect likely stashed the scrolls in the cave around A.D. 70, as Roman troops closed in to crush the First Jewish Revolt. Hundreds more scrolls eventually would come to light. Dating as far back as the third century B.C., they are the oldest biblical texts ever found.The Qumran caves are in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and many people consider Price’s work illegal under international law. But that hasn’t dissuaded him or the dig’s Israeli director, Oren Gutfeld of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, from pursuing a research agenda derived from an earlier, equally controversial exercise.In 1993, after signing the Oslo Accords—which provided a framework for transferring disputed territories to Palestinian control—the Israeli government launched Operation Scroll, an urgent survey of all the archaeological sites the country potentially stood to lose. The inventory was rushed and cursory, and the surveyors found no new scrolls. But they mapped dozens of caves that had been damaged by earthquakes and possibly overlooked by Bedouin treasure hunters. The one cataloged as Cave 53 caught the attention of Price in 2010 and later Gutfeld, who described it as a “juicy” cave. “They found lots of pottery from a range of periods of time—from early Islamic to Second Temple to Hellenistic,” he says. “There’s reason to hope something else might be there.”Two years ago, during their initial probe of Cave 53, the archaeologists discovered a small roll of blank parchment and broken storage jars—tantalizing evidence that the cavern might have housed scrolls. Today, after nearly three weeks of digging, their finds are arrayed across a folding table outside the cave. They include Neolithic arrowheads, an obsidian blade from Anatolia, and the bronze cooking pot. But no scrolls. And so the digging continues.People of many faiths venerate religious relics. But for those who believe that God speaks through words written down by prophets and apostles in past ages, ancient texts are foundational to their faith. From artfully adorned medieval manuscripts to humble fragments of papyrus, revered texts represent tangible links to God’s appointed messengers, whether Muhammad, Moses, or Jesus Christ.Reverence for holy writ is integral to the faith of evangelical Christians, who have become a driving force behind the search for long-lost biblical texts in desert caves, remote monasteries, and Middle Eastern antiquities markets. Critics say that the evangelical appetite for artifacts is fueling demand for looted objects—a charge borne out to some degree by recent investigations and by reports from legitimate dealers.“Evangelicals have had a tremendous impact on the market,” says Jerusalem antiquities seller Lenny Wolfe. “The price of anything connected to the lifetime of Christ goes way up.”Whatever their religious commitments, wealthy collectors and deep-pocketed benefactors have long played a supporting role in the search for ancient exotica. Among those helping to underwrite Price and Gutfeld’s Qumran expedition is a foundation established by Mark Lanier, a well-heeled Houston lawyer and avid collector of theological texts. Another archaeological dig, this one at Tel Shimron in Israel, is being supported by the new Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. The museum’s chairman, Steve Green, is president of the craft store giant Hobby Lobby and one of the biggest supporters of Christian causes in the United States. His enthusiasm for Bible hunting is unabashed.“There’s a lot to find out there—imagine how much more there could be,” Green tells me when I meet him inside the gleaming, $500 million, 430,000-square-foot museum. “We’re excited about turning over every rock.” But as Green, a devout Southern Baptist, has come to learn firsthand, not everyone in the Bible-hunting business is a saint. Turning over rocks may uncover scrolls but also snakes.Encountering serpents and other dangers—burning deserts, blinding sandstorms, armed bandits—went with the territory trodden by pioneering Bible hunters of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Egypt was among their favorite destinations; its dry climate is ideal for preserving fragile manuscripts. Many of the trailblazers were sturdy scholar-adventurers, and accounts of their travels and discoveries conjure up images from Raiders of the Lost Ark.Take, for example, Konstantin von Tischendorf, a German scholar who in 1844 made a long, dangerous journey through Egypt’s Sinai desert to the world’s oldest continuously inhabited Christian monastery, St. Catherine’s. There he encountered “the most precious biblical treasure in existence.” It was a codex—an ancient text in book form instead of a scroll—dating to the mid-fourth century. Known today as the Codex Sinaiticus, it’s one of the two oldest Christian Bibles surviving from antiquity, and the oldest complete copy of the New Testament.The discovery made Tischendorf “the most famous and most infamous textual scholar in history,” notes biographer Stanley Porter. According to his own account of events, Tischendorf first spotted some pages from the codex in a basket of old parchment the monks planned to burn. He rescued the pages and requested permission to take the entire codex back to Europe for study. The monks, alerted to its value by the foreign scholar’s excitement, would part with only a few dozen pages.Tischendorf made the arduous trek back to St. Catherine’s in 1853 but left with little to show for it. He returned a third and final time in 1859 after securing the sponsorship of the Russian tsar, considered the “defender and protector” of the Eastern Orthodox Church, to which the Sinai monastery belongs. This time Tischendorf’s doggedness paid off. After signing a pledge to return the codex once he’d made exact copies, he delivered it to his royal patron in St. Petersburg.From there the chain of events becomes tangled in controversy and accusations of imperialist power plays. The monks eventually “donated” the codex to the tsar, but whether they did so willingly or under pressure is still debated. In any event, the priceless Bible remained in St. Petersburg until 1933, when Joseph Stalin’s government, facing financial crisis and famine, sold it to the British Museum for the equivalent of nearly half a million U.S. dollars.Tischendorf wasn’t the first manuscript hunter to visit the remote monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai, nor would he be the last. Those who followed in his steps included Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson, Scottish twins and self-taught scholars who between them mastered some dozen languages. In 1892 the plucky Presbyterian sisters, both middle-aged widows by then, crossed the Egyptian desert on camelback and arrived at St. Catherine’s. They’d been tipped off that works in ancient Syriac—a dialect of Aramaic, a language Jesus spoke—were stashed in a dark closet. The sisters were eager to investigate.With the monks’ permission, they examined several volumes, including a dirt-encrusted codex that hadn’t been cracked open for decades, perhaps centuries. Using their camp kettle to steam the grimy pages apart, they found that it was a biography of female saints dated A.D. 778. Then sharp-eyed Lewis noticed a faint underwriting beneath the top layer of text and realized that it was a palimpsest—a manuscript that had been partially erased and reused. Studying the text beneath the text, she was staggered to see that it was a translation of the four Gospels. Dating roughly to the early 400s, the Codex Sinaiticus Syriacus, as it’s known today, is one of the oldest copies of the Gospels ever discovered.Rather than try to “borrow” the Syriac codex—which remains at St. Catherine’s to this day—the sisters took photographs of each page with a camera they’d brought along to document their discoveries. They also used a chemical solution in a successful attempt to enhance the faded undertext of the palimpsest. Their work anticipated by more than a century the use of multispectral imaging and other technologies to reveal ancient biblical texts hidden beneath more recent writing.The remarkable manuscripts brought to the world’s attention by Tischendorf and the Scottish sisters were made of costly parchment or vellum. But the vast majority of texts from Christianity’s earliest centuries were written on papyrus, the paper of the ancient world.In 1896 Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, rookie archaeologists from Oxford University, were prospecting for artifacts at the long-buried Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus when they made an extraordinary find: an ancient garbage dump filled with layer upon layer of papyri. Over the next decade Grenfell and Hunt dug through a papyrus-filled pit some 30 feet deep and shipped half a million documents back to Oxford. Researchers have been painstakingly piecing together the fragments ever since.Most of the papyri are the prosaic paperwork of everyday life: bills, letters, tax assessments, a deed from the sale of a donkey. But about 10 percent of the hoard is literary, including bits of works by classical authors such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Some of the most dramatic finds—such as lost gospels that didn’t make it into the New Testament—have shed light on the formative years of the Christian faith. And more than a century after their discovery, thousands of fragments have yet to be studied closely. How many revelations await in those many boxes of ancient trash is anyone’s guess.For cloak-and-dagger drama, the Dead Sea Scrolls trump all other biblical discoveries. According to one version of the story, the Bedouin goat herders sold the seven parchments they’d found to two antiquities dealers in Bethlehem. A scholar from Jerusalem acquired three of the scrolls following a clandestine meeting through a barbed wire fence. A dealer named Khalil Iskander Shahin, also known as Kando, sold the four remaining scrolls to a Syrian archbishop in Jerusalem, who reportedly paid the equivalent of $250. In 1949, spooked by the Arab-Israeli War, the bishop smuggled the scrolls to the United States in hopes of selling them to a museum or university. After getting no takers, he placed a classified ad in the Wall Street Journal on June 1, 1954. An Israeli archaeologist, working through an American intermediary, arranged to purchase the scrolls for the Israeli government for $250,000. All seven of the original scrolls now reside in their own wing of Israel’s national museum in Jerusalem.As word of the scrolls’ discovery spread, a team led by archaeologist and Dominican priest Roland de Vaux descended on Qumran in 1949. By 1956 de Vaux and local Bedouin had found 10 more “scroll caves” containing scores of manuscripts, many of them disintegrated into thousands of fragments. It took decades for scholars, working in seclusion and secrecy, to reassemble and translate the tattered parchments. The long delay in publication spawned conspiracy theories that the powers that be—the pope? Zionists?—were deliberately suppressing the scrolls’ contents.Finally, by the mid-2000s, the translators finished publishing the bulk of their findings. The scrolls included legal texts, apocalyptic and ritual treatises, accounts of life in the Qumran sect, and remnants of 230 biblical manuscripts. Scholars were thrilled to learn that among them was a nearly complete copy of the Book of Isaiah from the Hebrew Bible. Its content was virtually identical to another copy of Isaiah dated almost a thousand years later. The Great Isaiah Scroll would become Exhibit A for scholars who defend the Bible against claims that its text was corrupted by scribes who, over centuries of copying by hand, introduced a multitude of mistakes and intentional changes. (More about this contentious debate later.)The history of bible hunting is one not only of buried treasures but also of fool’s gold. As archaeologists began excavating in the Qumran caves, other Bedouin did their own digging and sold what they found to Kando. His greatest purchase was the nearly 30-foot-long Temple Scroll, the longest of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In 1967, during the Arab-Israeli Six Day War, Israeli intelligence officers seized the Temple Scroll from Kando’s home, claiming it as government property. After the incident Kando reportedly started furtively moving his remaining scroll fragments to relatives in Lebanon and later to a bank vault in Switzerland.In 2009 Steve Green began buying rare Bibles and artifacts at an unprecedented pace, eventually acquiring some 40,000 objects—one of the largest private collections of biblical material in the world. His multimillion-dollar shopping spree inevitably led him to the Kandos’ doorstep. (Kando’s son William took over the family business after his father’s death in 1993.)“Steve Green came to see me many times,” William Kando tells me through a cloud of cigarette smoke the morning we meet in his Jerusalem shop. “He’s an honest man, a good Christian. He offered me $40 million for my Genesis fragment. I refused. Some people say it is priceless.”Green, through a spokesperson, says Kando set the price at $40 million, and he opted not to purchase it. Instead he bought more affordable scroll fragments.The merchant offers me more coffee, then fumbles through a ledger. “Here, you can see,” he says, pointing to a notation that he had sold seven Dead Sea Scroll fragments to Green in May 2010.When I visit the Museum of the Bible a day before its official opening, five scroll fragments are on display. I notice a sort of disclaimer accompanying the exhibit acknowledging that the fragments might be fakes. They’ve since received further testing, revealing that the fragments are probably modern forgeries.Kando indignantly denies that his family sold inauthentic fragments, suggesting that any forgeries must have come from less reputable dealers. Green, for his part, seems philosophical about his prize acquisitions. “You would hope it would be different in the biblical world,” he says. “But as it turns out, like in any other business, there are some shady people just trying to make a buck. All you can do is learn from your mistakes and not do business with them anymore.”One of Green’s mistakes—importing thousands of clay tablets and other artifacts that, according to experts, had likely been looted in Iraq—resulted in a fine from the U.S. Justice Department of three million dollars and forfeiture of the objects. “The fact is, most antiquities are looted, and most buyers don’t ask where they came from,” says Eitan Klein, deputy director of the Israel Antiquities Authority’s anti-looting division, when we meet in his cramped office in Jerusalem. “Because in my view, if you are dealing with antiquities, you must get your hands dirty somehow.”Klein’s phone rings. He listens, hangs up, and excuses himself, saying with a smile, “Our unit caught some looters, so I have to go.”One hundred tiny microform Bibles flew to the moon with astronaut Edgar Mitchell on Apollo 14 in 1971. The “lunar Bibles” were created by the Apollo Prayer League, NASA employees who prayed for the astronauts’ safety. Later some were set in gold and sold to collectors.Because the authentic Dead Sea Scrolls are “the most significant cultural treasure of a Jewish nature on Earth,” as curator Adolfo Roitman puts it, the sacred documents are preserved with exquisite care. Meanwhile multitudes of other biblical manuscripts are left to molder in academic storerooms or be consumed by fire, flood, insects, looters, or war in countries wracked by political upheaval. Conserving and documenting them before their secrets slip away forever is “literally a race against time,” says Daniel B. Wallace, head of the Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts in Plano, Texas.Wallace and other globe-trotting textual scholars—most notably the Benedictine monk Father Columba Stewart of the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library at Saint John’s University in Minnesota—have logged tens of thousands of miles traveling the world on an urgent mission: to digitally document ancient biblical manuscripts in archives, monastic libraries, and other repositories and make them available to scholars everywhere via the internet. It’s a daunting task. In the case of the New Testament, whose authors wrote in Greek, more than 5,500 Greek manuscripts and fragments have been found—more than any other ancient text. They total as many as 2.6 million pages, Wallace estimates, and like the Oxyrhynchus papyri, most of them have yet to receive scholarly attention.“About 80 percent of already known manuscripts that would be of help for New Testament scholarship aren’t published yet,” says Father Olivier-Thomas Venard of the École Biblique et Archéologique Française, a Dominican research center in Jerusalem. “It’s an embarrassment of riches,” adds Venard’s colleague Father Anthony Giambrone, “which frankly makes the challenges of textual criticism insurmountable. There are just not enough specialists to work on them.”The Institute for New Testament Textual Research in Münster, Germany, has sought to reduce the labor challenges by classifying biblical documents according to key passages, but such a system amounts to triage that wholly ignores numerous texts. A far more comprehensive solution may soon be technologically feasible, predicts Wallace, who hopes to use optical character recognition (OCR) software to digitize every volume of the Greek New Testament. “Right now it would take a scholar 400 years to read and collate all the known documents,” he says. “With OCR, we think we can do the job in 10 years.”You’d be forgiven for raising an awkward question at this point: Why does any of this matter? Why all the fuss about old Bibles and older scraps of Egyptian papyrus? For folks like Wallace, who teaches at an evangelical seminary, and Green, who has invested much of the family fortune in a world-class museum dedicated to the Bible, it boils down to this: Is their faith based on fact or fiction?“When visitors to our museum see an ancient text,” Green says, “they’re seeing evidence that what they believe isn’t just a bunch of fairy tales.”But how good is that evidence? Assuming for the moment that the God of the Bible actually exists and that he somehow spoke to the authors of the ancient biblical documents—do we have now what they wrote then? After all, none of their original writings, what scholars call the autographs, have been found. Their words survive only because they were hand copied countless times until the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. And even conservative scholars admit that no two copies are exactly alike.Few publishers would bet that such questions would produce a national best seller, but that’s what happened in 2005 with the publication of the cleverly titled Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. The book’s author, Bart Ehrman, argues that the “facts” about Jesus set forth in modern Bibles are based on centuries of copies, all of which say different things, so we may not know what the original texts actually said.In person, the goateed evangelical turned atheist is even-tempered if subversively caustic. Over coffee near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he’s a professor of religious studies, Ehrman recites a host of scriptural passages that he views with scholarly suspicion. The last 12 verses of the Gospel of Mark, he says, were likely tacked on many years after the fact, as was the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, foreshadowing Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem.Many of Ehrman’s assertions are debatable (literally so: he and Wallace have squared off in three public debates), but some scholars agree that Christian scribes deliberately corrupted certain passages over time. The question is one of degree.“Broadly, I support what Ehrman is saying about this,” says Peter Head, an Oxford scholar who studies Greek New Testament manuscripts. “But the manuscripts suggest a controlled fluidity. Variants emerge, but you can sort of figure out when and why. Now, it’s in the earlier period that we don’t have enough data. That’s the problem.”The “earlier period” that Head refers to begins with the birth of Christianity in the first century A.D. and concludes in the early fourth century. And while it’s true that more than 5,500 Greek New Testament manuscripts have been found, close to 95 percent of those copies come from the ninth to the 16th centuries. Only about 125 date back to the second or third centuries, and none to the first.None of these figures rattle Ehrman’s sparring partner Wallace, who considers Ehrman a friend and refers to him by his first name.“Bart likes to point out that we don’t have any autographs, only copies,” Wallace says. “But the fact is, we don’t have the autographs of any Greco-Roman literature, except possibly one fragment from one classical author.”Wallace acknowledges that the thousands of New Testament manuscripts contain myriad differences owing to scribes’ errors, but he argues that because scholars have such a wealth of texts to study and compare, they’ve been able to identify those errors and largely recover the original wording. He also points out that an important measure of the trustworthiness of any historical document is its nearness in time to the events it purports to record.“On average the earliest surviving copies of Greco-Roman literature are half a millennium removed from the time of composition,” he says. “But in the case of the New Testament, the earliest copies are only a few decades after the fact. That’s a huge difference.”Still, the lack of Christian writings from the first century would seem to be a point in Ehrman’s column—a point Wallace is eager to eliminate. Too eager, perhaps.During a debate with Ehrman in February 2012, Wallace dropped a bombshell. A manuscript fragment of Mark’s Gospel had recently been discovered that was authoritatively dated to the late first century—more than a century earlier than the oldest known text from the Book of Mark. It would be the only first-century New Testament document ever discovered, and the earliest surviving Christian text. A study of the ancient manuscript would likely be published in 2013, the Texas theologian said.The Bible-hunting world went into hyperventilation over Wallace’s disclosure. Who discovered the Mark manuscript? Where was it being kept? Was it on the market? How many millions would it cost to buy? But five years passed, and the document had yet to see the light of day.I begin making calls in December 2017. A month later I show up at the Sackler Library on the campus of Oxford University, which houses the world’s largest collection of ancient papyri. An Italian woman in a laboratory coat leads me through a secure area. She is Daniela Colomo, a research associate at Oxford and curator of the legendary Oxyrhynchus papyrus collection excavated by Grenfell and Hunt around the turn of the 20th century.In marked contrast to the regal Oxford townscape, the papyrology room containing one of the most vital repositories of biblical texts is a chaotic, fluorescent-lit assemblage of strewn papers, mislaid coffee mugs, and low-tech microscopes. Colomo produces a piece of acid-free paper, folded in the manner of an envelope. A brownish fragment of papyrus, not much bigger than my thumb, lies in the middle. Squinting, hovering a foot above it, I can make out a series of scratches across the ancient scrap.“This is Mark,” Colomo says. “The date is probably late second century, early third century. We never intended to take an official position, but there were all those blogs being written, and all the rumors. So, because of all the anonymous publicity, we have to publish it soon.”Colomo and her colleague Dirk Obbink, an American papyrologist and Oxford professor, published their findings last May. The fragment, cataloged as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345, was among the thousands unearthed by Grenfell and Hunt that had yet to be fully examined. The Egypt Exploration Society, which sponsored the Oxyrhynchus excavation and retains ownership of the collection, issued a statement that reads in part: “This is the same text that Professor Obbink showed to some visitors to Oxford in 2011/12, which some of them reported in talks and on social media as possibly dating to the late first century A.D. on the basis of a provisional dating when the text was catalogued many years ago.”The buildup and subsequent letdown over the much touted Mark fragment have obscured the actual importance of the discovery. Only two other fragments of Mark from before A.D. 300 are known to exist. Colomo chalks up the frenzy to first-century fever among some researchers who dream of unearthing a Gospel or epistle penned by an Apostle.“Among the New Testament scholars, particularly in the States, there’s this tendency to look for the earliest documents, hoping to find an autograph from people who met Jesus,” Colomo says. “They tend to date a papyrus very early, using random similarities. This is not scholarly.”For his part, Wallace has apologized to Ehrman for announcing an unverified find. “I take full responsibility,” he says. “I didn’t vet it properly. It was naive on my part.”It may also be naive, Ehrman says, to expect a single, small fragment to settle the long-simmering debate over the Bible. “Would it change anybody’s mind about anything?” he says. “My view is, almost certainly not. I’ve repeatedly said that if you find three or four early manuscripts from different places and they all say the same thing, then you have an argument. I just don’t think that’s likely.”Randall Price, the Qumran excavator, is also having to come to terms with long odds. In all but the rarest cases, archaeological feats are measured in increments rather than mother lodes. His and Gutfeld’s team of students, friends, and family members are wrapping things up in Cave 53 one morning in late January when a shout rings out. Price’s wife, Beverlee, emerges from a natural chamber, not quite a cave itself, that the team discovered recently. In her hand is a clay object about two inches long.Price studies it. “Yep,” he slowly murmurs. “That’s a rim.” Meaning: the rim of what might have been a scroll jar. Chances are, whatever else the sherd belonged to has long since been carted off by Bedouin. But the Bible that Price reads and believes teaches, above all else, to have faith. And where there are scroll jars…“Hey, come on out!” he hollers into Cave 53. “We’ve got some digging to do!”",
"A piece of parchment rolled up in a jug that was being processed for writing, found in a cave on the cliffs west of Qumran by Hebrew University archeaologists.Archaeologists may be one step closer to decoding the mystery of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls.Researchers from the University of Haifa in Israel have restored and deciphered one of the last untranslated Qumran Scrolls. The collection, which consists of 900 ancient Jewish manuscripts, has been shrouded in controversy since it was unearthed more than 70 years ago. (Read: "Dead Sea Scrolls Mystery Solved?")The university's Eshbal Ratson and Jonathan Ben-Dov spent one year reassembling the 60 fragments that make up the scroll. Deciphered from a band of coded text on parchment, the find provides insight into the community of people who wrote it and the 364-day calendar they would have used."Because this number can be divided into four and seven, special occasions always fall on the same day," Ratson and Ben-Dov say in a press release. "The Qumran calendar is unchanging."The scroll names celebrations that indicate shifts in seasons as "Tekufah," which is Hebrew for "period." These celebrations have been known from other texts but have not been officially named until now. (Watch: "Decoding the Dead Sea Scrolls")It also details two religious events known from another Dead Sea Scroll. The festivals, for New Wine and for New Oil, would have been tacked onto the Jewish harvest festival Shavuot 100 and 150 days after the first Sabbath of Passover, respectively.This scroll also gives information about its authors, who would have roamed the region's desert between the second century BC and second century AD. Dates for the aforementioned celebrations appear to have been scribbled in the margins between columns of text, giving the impression that they were added to the scroll by one person after it was authored by another.As religious documents, a wave of controversy surrounds the Dead Sea Scrolls. They were written between the second century BC and the second century AD, but their exact authors are highly contested. Scholars agree, however, that the documents—which consist of explanatory, wisdom, apocalyptic, and calendrical texts, in addition to hymns and prayers—were written by Judean desert dwellers. (Read: "New Dead Sea Scroll Find May Help Detect Forgeries")About 230 "Biblical" manuscripts make up the Scrolls, which refer to practices found in the Hebrew Bible. Other "non-Biblical" documents relate to biblical texts, describing religious beliefs and community practices rather than explicit stories mentioned in the Bible.The scrolls are mostly written in Hebrew and code, although Aramaic and Greek scrolls have also been found. Most are scribed on parchment, but some are written on papyrus, and one has been found on copper. Scanning efforts have been made to preserve the ancient texts. (See: "Dead Sea Scrolls Being Digitized for Web")Now, only one more known scroll remains untranslated.Familiar yet exotic, this gold figurine of the Greek goddess of love bears a forehead mark from India. It is part of the fabled 'Bactrian Hoard,' a collection of thousands of 2,000-year-old gold objects excavated from nomad burials in Afghanistan in 1978. Once believed to have been stolen, most of the hoard was re-discovered in a bank vault in Kabul in 2003.A previous version of this story misidentified when the scroll's authors lived in the desert and the language most of the Dead Sea Scrolls were written in. The story has been updated.",
"Archaeologists uncovered this 2,000-year-old parchment in a newly discovered cave near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.The discovery of a twelfth cave associated with the famous Dead Sea Scrolls may arm scholars with new clues to deter looters and detect modern forgeries of the ancient documents.Earlier this week archaeologists announced the discovery of the cave—the first scroll site found since 1956—and revealed the results of recent excavations. The Israeli team found numerous storage jars that had been hidden in niches cut into the cave walls, but all were broken and their contents removed.Some items were left behind, however, including leather scroll ties, textiles for wrapping scrolls, and a pair of rusty pickaxes from the 1950s—telltale signs that the cave had once harbored a collection of scrolls stored in clay jars, but looters had made off with the documents decades ago.“The findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen,” said Hebrew University archaeologist and excavation director Oren Gutfeld.The team also found pieces of parchment with no writing on it. Such material has become a hot commodity, with scraps of ancient parchment commanding high prices, according to Randall Price, an archaeologist at Liberty University who collaborated on the project. Much of the material is supplied by looters, who in recent years have been aggressively targeting the Dead Sea caves.The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) has apprehended a growing number of artifact hunters attempting to enter the caves, usually under cover of night, Price said. The increase in illegal digging prompted the IAA to launch Operation Scroll, a renewed effort to locate and systematically explore the region’s caves.Archaeologists have determined that this cave on the rocky cliffs of Qumran once harbored ancient manuscripts similar to the famous Dead Sea Scrolls.The goal is to have “controlled archaeological excavations in possible scroll caves to prevent this knowledge from being lost to history,” Price said, adding that there’s probably another 50 sites that merit investigating in the near future.The Dead Sea scrolls are often called the greatest archaeological find of the 20th century. At more than 2,000 years old, they include the earliest surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. Bedouin shepherds discovered the first scrolls in a cave near Khirbet Qumran on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea in late 1946 or early 1947. Since then searchers have found scrolls in 10 other caves. (Also see "Dead Sea Scrolls Mystery Solved?")Over the past 15 years there has been an increase in the number of Dead Sea Scroll fragments offered for sale on the private art market, said Lawrence Schiffman, professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies at New York University and an authority on the scrolls. “Many of the fragments that entered the market since 2002 appear to be forged.”Some forgeries have expert lettering on parchment as old as the actual scrolls themselves, Schiffman said. “It’s possible some of this is coming from caves where people were able to locate ancient blank material to write on.”These scroll jars were found inside the cave.The blank parchment that archaeologists recently found may shed light on how high quality forgeries could be making their way to the market. And because it was recovered by scientifically rigorous methods, the parchment will help experts assess fragments that show up for sale.“When things turn up, you just don’t know where they came from—you’re relying on the testimony of the seller,” Price said. “We need these controlled excavations so that when something’s found, there’s no doubt of its origins and authenticity.”The prospect of discovering more scrolls has already spawned breathless speculation and headlines, but Schiffman isn’t expecting any fodder for the next novel by Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code.“We’re not going to find the diary of the three wise men,” he quipped. “We might find new books that help us understand passages of the New Testament or Talmudic literature. But the notion that a bombshell text will come and overturn our picture of ancient religion at the turn of the era really isn’t a realistic one.”Archaeologists Oren Gutfeld and Ahiad Ovadia survey the cave.Neither is it realistic, according to Schiffman, to expect Israel to heed the protests of Palestinians who argue that the Dead Sea Scrolls are rightfully part of their cultural patrimony.The effort to recover additional scrolls is taking place in the West Bank, which Palestinians—and the United Nations—consider occupied territory. Israel signed a U.N. convention in 1954 that forbids excavation and removal of ''cultural artifacts'' by foreign occupiers.Even so, "There isn't any Israeli government that’s about to surrender the most ancient copies of the Bible and Jewish literature to someone else,” Schiffman said. “Plain and simple, it isn’t happening.”Follow Michelle Z.

"Around the altarpiece, painted clouds hover in a blue sky. Small statues stand in niches backlit with brilliant aqua. On a rug near the church wall a woman in a blue sari with a purple veil covering her hair kneels motionless, elbows at her sides, hands upraised. In a larger, newer church adjacent, a shard of pale bone no bigger than a thumbnail lies in a golden reliquary. A label in English identifies the relic as belonging to St. Thomas. On this site, tradition says, Thomas founded the first Christian church in India, in A.D. 52.In Parur and elsewhere in Kerala exotic animals and vines and mythic figures are woven into church facades and interiors: Elephants, boars, peacocks, frogs, and lions that resemble dragons—or perhaps they are dragons that resemble lions—demonstrate the rich and decidedly non-Western flavor of these Christian places. Brightly painted icons are everywhere, of Thomas and the Virgin Mary and Jesus and St. George. Even Hindus pray to St. George, the dragon slayer, believing he may offer their children protection from cobras. At Diamper Church in Thripunithura a painted white statue of the pietà—the Virgin Mary holding the dead Jesus—is backed by a pink metal sun radiating rectangular blades of light.Kerala's Thomas Christians—like Christians elsewhere in Asia and in Africa and Latin America—have made the faith uniquely their own, incorporating traditional art, architecture, and natural symbolism. And so a statue depicting Mary flanked by two elephants shading her head with a bower seems at home among the palms of southern India.Thomas, or Doubting Thomas as he is commonly known, was one of the Twelve Apostles, disciples sent out after Christ's Crucifixion to spread the newborn faith. He was joined by Peter, Andrew, James the Greater, James the Lesser, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thaddaeus, Simon—and Matthias, who replaced the former disciple and alleged traitor, Judas Iscariot. In time the terms "apostle" and "apostolic" (derived from the Greek apostolos, or messenger) were applied to others who spread the word. In the case of Paul, he claimed the title of apostle for himself, believing he had seen the Lord and received a spiritual commission from him. Mary Magdalene is known as the apostle to the Apostles for her role of announcing the resurrection to them. Although only two of the four Evangelists—Matthew and John—were among the original Apostles, Mark and Luke are considered apostolic because of the importance of their work in writing the New Testament Gospels.In the first years after the Crucifixion, Christianity was only the seed of a new religion, lacking a developed liturgy, a method of worship, and a name—the earliest followers called it simply "the way." It was not even a formal sect of Judaism. Peter was the movement's first champion; in the Acts of the Apostles we hear of his mass conversions and miraclemaking—healing the lame, raising the dead—and in an un-Christian flourish, calling down a supernatural death upon one couple who held back a portion of their donation to the community.In its earliest days the movement was too insignificant to attract wide-scale persecution, and Christians, as they came to be called, had more friction with neighboring Jewish sects than with the Roman Empire. The faith's first martyr, according to the Bible, was St. Stephen, a young Christian leader who enraged a Jewish community by suggesting that Christ would return and destroy the Temple of Jerusalem. After he was tried for blasphemy, around the year 35, his accusers dragged him out of the city and stoned him to death while he prayed for them. The young Saul—who would soon become Paul in his celebrated conversion on the road to Damascus— observed Stephen's execution, minding the cloaks of those who stoned him.In the year 44 King Herod Agrippa I imprisoned and beheaded James the Greater, the first of the Apostles to die. In 64, when a great fire in Rome destroyed 10 of the city's 14 quarters, Emperor Nero, accused by detractors of setting the fire himself, pinned the catastrophe on the growing Christian movement and committed scores of believers to death in his private arena. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote: "An immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind … Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired." In the year 110 Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch, was arrested by the Romans under Trajan, shipped to Rome, and condemned to death ad bestias—by beasts—at the public games. Bloody episodes like this would recur sporadically for the next two centuries.Tradition holds that 11 of the Twelve Apostles were martyred. Peter, Andrew, and Philip were crucified; James the Greater and Thaddaeus fell to the sword; James the Lesser was beaten to death while praying for his attackers; Bartholomew was flayed alive and then crucified; Thomas and Matthew were speared; Matthias was stoned to death; and Simon was either crucified or sawed in half. John—the last survivor of the Twelve—likely died peaceably, possibly in Ephesus, around the year 100.In the early days, Columba Stewart, a Benedictine monk and historian at Saint John's Abbey in Minnesota, told me, "the organizational structure, the great institution of the church—signified for Roman Catholics today by the Vatican and its complex hierarchy—simply wasn't there. There was an apostolic band of followers. There were missionary efforts in major centers, first in Jerusalem, then Antioch, then Rome, but certainly no sense of a headquarters. Instead you had this tiny, vulnerable, poor, often persecuted group of people who were on fire with something."The Apostles were the movement's cutting edge, spreading the message across the vast trade network of the ancient world and leaving small Christian communities in their paths. "To study the lives of the Apostles," Stewart said, "is a bit like what we've been doing with the Hubble telescope—getting as close as we can to seeing these earliest galaxies. This was the big bang moment for Christianity, with the Apostles blasting out of Jerusalem and scattering across the known world."Thomas the Apostle went east, through what is now Syria and Iran and, historians believe, on down to southern India. He traveled farther than even the indefatigable Paul, whose journeys encompassed much of the Mediterranean. Of all the Apostles, Thomas represents most profoundly the missionary zeal associated with the rise of Christianity—the drive to travel to the ends of the known world to preach a new creed.Mark the Evangelist too spread the word, bringing Christ's message to Egypt and founding the Coptic faith. But for some Catholics, Mark represents most emphatically the saint as political symbol, powerfully linked with the identity of Venice. Although a figure from the ancient past, he retains a stronger grip on the consciousness of modern-day Venetians than Washington or Lincoln holds on most Americans.If Thomas is the iconic missionary and Mark a political cornerstone, Mary Magdalene epitomizes the mystical saint, closely associated with grace and divine intercession. Other saints, including Thérèse of Lisieux and Teresa of Ávila, play a similar role among Catholics, but none has exerted a stronger pull on the imagination, or created more controversy, than Mary Magdalene. Once maligned as a reformed courtesan, venerated today by millions worldwide, she was a significant presence in Christ's inner circle.Although one tradition holds that she died in Ephesus, others maintain that she traveled from the Middle East to southern France. But establishing with scientific certainty that Mary Magdalene came to the hills of Provence, or that Thomas died in India, is likely to remain outside our grasp. Scientific analysis of relics is invariably inadequate, often confirming only that the bones are of the right gender and period. Advances in testing and archaeology, together with the discovery of yet unknown manuscripts, will continue to refine our historical knowledge of the saints. But much will remain inconclusive. How best, then, to understand these individuals if the reach of science is limited? As with most of the earliest Christians, we must rely largely on legend and historical accounts, acknowledging the power these mythic figures still exert today, some 2,000 years after their deaths.Many historians believe that Thomas landed on the palm-lined coast of Kerala at a site now called Cranganore. He is reported to have established seven churches in Kerala and to have been martyred 20 years later on the other side of the country, in Mylapore, now a neighborhood in Chennai. At Palayur Church in Guruvayur, Thomas is said to have raised the first cross in India and performed one of his earliest miracles: When he encountered a group of Brahmans throwing water into the air as part of a ritual, he asked why the water fell back to Earth if it was pleasing to their deity. My God, Thomas said, would accept such an offering. He then flung a great spray into the air, and the droplets hung there in the form of glistening white blossoms. Most onlookers converted on the spot; the rest fled.My guides in Kerala were Columba Stewart and Ignatius Payyappilly, a priest from Kochi in Kerala whose connection to Thomas is personal. He and his mother nearly died during his birth, but his grandmother and mother, the latter slipping in and out of consciousness, prayed fervently to St. Thomas. "And we were spared," Payyappilly told me.Stewart is the executive director of his abbey's Hill Museum & Manuscript Library, which has been preserving religious manuscripts around the world since 1965. Payyappilly and his small staff spearhead the effort in Kerala, digitizing and preserving thousands of inscribed palm leaves and other manuscripts. Theirs is a race against a humid climate, which destroys manuscripts if they're not properly cared for. Since 2006 the team has accumulated 12 terabytes of digitized data—one million images of manuscripts. The oldest document in their possession, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, dates to 1291. These extraordinary documents are important to Thomas Christians, linking them to the founder of their faith.In India, Thomas is revered as a bold missionary. In the West, he represents the believer who wrestles with uncertainty. "The classic portrayal of Thomas," Stewart said, "is the doubting Thomas. That's a little inaccurate, because it's not so much that he doubted the resurrection but that he needed a personal encounter with Jesus to make the resurrection real. So you might think of him as the pragmatic Thomas or the forensic Thomas. The guy who's so experiential that he said, 'I need to put my finger in the wounds in his hands and in his side.' And this experience gave him the fuel he needed to do amazing things."Thomas's moment of incredulity has proved a two-edged sword in the history of Christian thought. On the one hand, some theologians are quick to point out that his doubt is only natural, echoing the uncertainty, if not the deep skepticism, felt by millions in regard to metaphysical matters. How can we know? That Thomas challenged the risen Christ, probed the wounds, and then believed, some say, lends deeper significance to his subsequent faith. On the other hand, his crisis of doubt, shared by none of the other Apostles, is seen by many as a spiritual failure, as a need to know something literally that one simply cannot know. In the Gospel of John, 20:29, Christ himself chastises Thomas, saying, "Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."His skepticism notwithstanding, St. Thomas still stands as the direct link between his converts in Kerala and the founding Christian story on the shores of the Mediterranean, clear across the known world of the first century. Unlike later Christian groups in Asia who were converted by missionaries, Thomas Christians believe their church was founded by one of Christ's closest followers, and this is central to their spiritual identity. "They are an apostolic church," Stewart said, "and that's the ultimate seal of approval for a Christian group."Mark the Evangelist is indelibly associated with pride in place: No historical figure is more clearly linked with Venice than her patron saint. His square is the heart of Venice, his basilica the center of its ancient faith. Mark's symbol—the winged lion, its paw upon the open Gospel—is as ubiquitous in Venice as the gondola. For the Venetians of the ninth century and after, "Viva San Marco!" was the battle cry, and legends of St. Mark are entwined with the earliest roots of the Venetian Republic. And yet, tradition tells us, Mark died a martyr in Alexandria, Egypt. How did he gain such importance in a Western city-state?In the delicate balance of political one-upmanship in ninth-century Italy, a young power bound for greatness required theistic no less than military legitimacy. As its patron, the city needed not the third-string dragon slayer it had, St. Theodore, but a titan among saints. And so was born a masterstroke of shadow politics unrivaled in medieval history: In 828, presumably on the orders of the doge, two Venetian merchants named Bono da Malamocco and Rustico da Torcello stole the remains of St. Mark from his tomb in Alexandria or, some say, conned it from the possession of local priests. Returning to their ship, the conspirators put the saint's remains in a basket, covering them with pork to discourage official entanglements. When Muslim port authorities stopped the thieves and peered into the basket, they recoiled in disgust, crying "Kanzir! Kanzir!"—"pig" in Arabic—and commanded the Venetians to hurry along. On the voyage home, legend tells us, a tempest blew up off the Greek coast. St. Mark, his remains lashed to the mast, quieted the storm, saving the vessel. However embroidered by legend, this brazen theft of the Evangelist's relics gave the fledgling republic a spiritual cachet matched in all of Latin Christendom only by that of St. Peter's Rome. This extraordinary coup set in motion brilliant successes that brought forth a Venetian superpower.From the earliest days of the Republic, "St. Mark was the flag of Venice," Gherardo Ortalli, a medievalist at the University of Venice and a leading expert on St. Mark, told me. "I don't think there are other examples of saints who were so important politically. Wherever Venice left her imprint, you find Mark's lion—in Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Alexandria. On the old Venetian gold coin, the ducato, St. Mark offers the flag of Venice to the doge."And what of the saint's relics? Are the remains entombed in the sarcophagus in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice really his? What of the skull in Alexandria that the Coptic Church claims belongs to the saint? What of the relic, possibly a bone fragment, said to be Mark's, given to Egypt by the Vatican in 1968, in effect as an apology for the ninth-century theft? Are any of these relics, including that tiny piece of bone in the church in Kerala attributed to Thomas, genuine?"It's not important if they have the real bones or not," Ortalli said, "because in the Middle Ages they had a very different mentality. You could have 50 fingers of a saint. It wasn't a problem."For scientists, nonbelievers, many believers, and perhaps for the forensic Thomas, 50 fingers of the same saint is a problem. Even the Catholic Church calls in pathologists to examine, date, and preserve relics in the church's possession. Based in Genoa, Ezio Fulcheri is a devout Catholic and trained pathologist who has worked on church relics for decades. He has studied and preserved the remains of many saints, including John of the Cross and Clare of Assisi, a friend of St. Francis's. "Whenever we can find a relic that is clearly not authentic," Fulcheri said, "we acknowledge that. The church does not want false relics to be venerated." But what of those relics, like St. Mark's, that have yet to be tested? Scholars, scientists, and even clerics within the Catholic Church have called, without success, for scientific testing of the remains in Mark's sarcophagus. Clearly the church has little to gain, and quite a bit to lose, by testing bones of such critical importance. In the case of St. Mark, perhaps it's safer not to know—at least for now.Not all scientists are eager to press too hard on holy relics. Giorgio Filippi, an archaeologist employed by the Vatican, told me he had opposed the recent analysis and dating of Paul's relics in Rome, announced by the pope in 2009. "Curiosity does not justify the research. If the sarcophagus was empty or if you found two men or a woman, what would you hypothesize? Why do you want to open St. Paul's tomb? I didn't want to be present in this operation." The subsequent investigation, through a finger-size hole drilled in the sarcophagus, produced a bone fragment the size of a lentil, grains of red incense, a piece of purple linen with gold sequins, and threads of blue fabric. Independent laboratory analysis, the church claimed, revealed that they dated to the first or second century. Not conclusive, but better news for the faithful than if they had hailed from the fourth century. The first-century date would mean the bones could be those of St. Paul. Until science advances to the point that testing can reveal fine details such as that the person was short, bald, and from Tarsus—Paul's presumed birthplace on the Turkish coast—we're not likely to get much closer to the truth.Mark's bones aside, I asked Ortalli if the pious of Venice pray to their patron saint."It's better to pray to the Virgin or to Christ," he said. "St. Mark is more complicated. Apart from the basilica, it is difficult to find a place to light a candle to St. Mark. He is many things, but you don't go to St. Mark with a candle." In Catholic and Orthodox churches believers often light candles to accompany prayers to the saints, mounting them before favored icons or statues. "St. Mark is part of [a Venetian's] identity," Ortalli continued. "It's something in your bones—you have two feet, and you have St. Mark. When older people are drunk on the street late at night, they often sing, 'Viva Venezia, viva San Marco, viva le glorie del nostro leon.' Venice was constructed with a soul in which St. Mark is the center."When the Venetian Republic was finally dissolved under Napoleon, the cry of mourning and defiance on the streets was not "Viva la libertà" or "Viva la repubblica" but "Viva San Marco."East of Aix-en-Provence, in the face of a broad, forested massif overlooking a high plain, lies the cave of Sainte-Baume. Here, according to Roman Catholic tradition, Mary Magdalene spent the last 30 years of her life. From the parking lot, a steep hike through the forest brings you to the cave and a small, adjoining monastery. On a clear June morning the cave's interior was noticeably colder than the air outside. In the candlelight a stone altar glowed in the center of the grotto, and statues of Mary Magdalene were visible in the cave's irregular corners. Two relics of the saint—a lock of hair and the presumed end of a tibia, dark with age, lay in a gilded reliquary.I later spoke with Candida Moss, professor of New Testament and Christian origins at the University of Notre Dame. Moss has a particular interest in early martyrs; I asked if work had been done on the psychology of relics. "People have looked at relics as part of a grieving process," she said. "When my mother died, they offered each of us a piece of her hair to keep, and we all did. So I think anyone who has ever mourned would understand why you would fixate on things associated with someone you loved. Even more so in small Christian communities. The appeal was of a person in your midst, with whom you could have direct contact after his or her death."In the cave of Sainte-Baume I sat in a rear pew during Mass, joined by a handful of pilgrims and a large group of cheerful French middle schoolers, arms crossed against the cold. Later, Fathers Thomas Michelet and François Le Hégaret led vespers. Sitting near me was Angela Rinaldi, a former pilgrim and a resident of the area since 2001. Rinaldi first came to the site with her companion at that time, a modern shaman drawn to Sainte-Baume not for its Catholic significance but for its reputation among shamans and New Age practitioners. Local tradition holds that the cave long ago served as a shrine for pagan fertility rites and endures as a pilgrimage site for those seeking feminine spirituality. The Catholic faith of Rinaldi's childhood eventually reasserted itself, and she began to help out at the small bookshop.I asked how her perception of Mary had shifted while she'd been at Sainte-Baume. "In the beginning," she said, "I compared myself a lot to her … My life before was a constant seeking for something different, for something else. For a great love—not just love coming from another person but a love which can only come, I believe, from a spiritual dimension."There is some sort of force everywhere in this forest—not just in the cave. It has nothing to do with the representation of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel. It's an energy which makes you stand up afterward." She paused. "I don't know how to explain it," she said, laughing. "There is a silence in the cave which is full of life."The cave has been cared for by the Dominican Order since 1295. Earlier in the day I visited with Michelet and Le Hégaret over lunch in the monastery's simple, beautifully antique dining room. Through its open leaded windows, from the monastery's great height upon the cliff face, the forest and the plain below could be seen for miles during breaks in the fog."After the Virgin Mary," Michelet said, "Mary Magdalene is the most important woman in the New Testament. And yet we speak of her very little. It's too bad, as many could be touched by this woman, who was a sinner and who was chosen by Christ as the first witness of his resurrection. He didn't choose an Apostle or the Virgin Mary. He chose Mary Magdalene. Why? Perhaps because she was the first to ask forgiveness. It was not yet the hour of Peter," he said, referring to Peter's rise to fame as a miracle worker and the founder of the Catholic Church. "It was the hour of Mary Magdalene."The significance of this moment in the New Testament when she first witnessed the risen Christ has been debated for centuries. In the Gospel of John, three days after Christ's burial Mary Magdalene went first to the sepulchre, "while it was still dark," and found that the stone covering it had been moved. She ran to find the disciples, who returned with her and saw that the tomb was empty. "Then the disciples went away again to their own homes," reads the scripture. "But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping." She stayed, as she had remained at the foot of the cross. When she peered again into the sepulchre, she saw two angels where the body of Christ had rested. "Woman, why are you weeping?" they asked her. "Because they have taken away my Lord," she said, "and I do not know where they have laid him." And then, the Gospel says, the risen Christ appeared to her.Such tenacity would have served her well if she did indeed spend three decades in the cold and damp of the Provence cave. "This is known as a place of penitence," Le Hégaret said. "In winter it's austere. Very few people come up to the cave. The road is frozen for weeks. There is a great simplicity here." He chuckled. "There is a proverb among the brothers of Provence: At Sainte-Baume either you go crazy, or you become a saint." With Christian Vacquié, the warden responsible for the ancient forest at Sainte-Baume, I visited a much smaller cave in the same massif that had contained the remains of Neanderthals from 150,000 years ago. This cave and others nearby have a distinctly female-reproductive organ shape, leading some to believe that they were fertility-cult sites in prehistoric times. One can imagine barren Neanderthals performing fertility rituals many tens of thousands of years before the arrival of Mary Magdalene.Protected by the state and cherished for its rich biological diversity, the forest itself has long been held sacred. "There was once a priest at the grotto," Vacquié told me with a grin, "who said that while he was Mary Magdalene's majordomo, I was her gardener." The forest and local caves are still believed to have a strong connection to fecundity, and women have come here for millennia to pray for children. To this day some women even rub their abdomens against the statues of Mary Magdalene as they pray. This physicality is not encouraged by the church, Le Hégaret told me, but it's difficult to prevent. On the walls of the cave are notes and plaques of gratitude in many languages. "Thank you Saint Mary Magdalene for healing my daughter," reads one in French dated October 1860. Another reads simply, "Merci pour Marion."The Dominicans manage a hostel on the plain at the foot of the massif, the Hôtellerie de la Sainte-Baume, receiving pilgrims, students, scholars, and other travelers. There I spoke with Marie-Ollivier Guillou, a novitiate and former sailor who served four years as a priest on French submarines, including Le Terrible, before being transferred here two years ago. "For me," he said, "Mary Magdalene is the saint of love. She was a very courageous woman. She was one of the few who stayed at the Crucifixion. Most of the others ran for their lives, but Mary Magdalene stayed at the foot of the cross, ready to die for Christ. In this sense she is the model for the religious life."Near the end of my time at Sainte-Baume I went back into the cave and climbed the short flight of steps to the rise of stone on which legend says Mary Magdalene slept; it's the only spot in the cave that remains dry. The last of the other visitors had left; fog rolled through the open doorway. Standing in the shadows, I reached through the grating and pressed my hand against the stone. The grotto was perfectly silent, save for the faintest occasional drip in the cistern, the same ancient spring that would have supplied the saint with fresh water.When I had suggested to Thomas Michelet that Mary Magdalene may never have come to Provence, he replied in a matter-of-fact tone, "There was a priest who lived here at the cave for decades. He said that while it's impossible to know if Mary Magdalene truly came here in the first century, that certainty was of less importance. She's here now."",
"Click to explore portrayals of Jesus, which range from Roman-era frescoes to a modern forensic reconstruction.The office of Eugenio Alliata in Jerusalem looks like the home base of any archaeologist who’d rather be in the field dirtying his hands than indoors tidying things up. A tumble of dusty, defunct computer equipment sits in one corner, and excavation reports share crowded shelves with measuring reels and other tools of the trade. It feels like the office of every archaeologist I’ve met in the Middle East, except that Alliata is wearing the chocolate brown habit of a Franciscan friar and his headquarters are in the Monastery of the Flagellation. According to church tradition, the monastery marks the spot where Jesus Christ, condemned to death, was scourged by Roman soldiers and crowned with thorns.“Tradition” is a word you hear a lot in this corner of the world, where throngs of tourists and pilgrims are drawn to dozens of sites that, according to tradition, are touchstones of the life of Christ—from his birthplace in Bethlehem to his burial place in Jerusalem.For an archaeologist turned journalist like me, ever mindful that entire cultures rose and fell and left few traces of their time on Earth, searching an ancient landscape for shards of a single life feels like a fool’s errand, like chasing a ghost. And when that ghost is none other than Jesus Christ, believed by more than two billion of the world’s people to be the very Son of God, well, the assignment tempts one to seek divine guidance.Which is why, in my repeated visits to Jerusalem, I keep coming back to the Monastery of the Flagellation, where Father Alliata always welcomes me and my questions with bemused patience. As a professor of Christian archaeology and director of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum’s museum, he’s part of a 700-year-old Franciscan mission to look after and protect ancient religious sites in the Holy Land—and, since the 19th century, to excavate them according to scientific principles.As a man of faith, Father Alliata seems at peace with what archaeology can—and cannot—reveal about Christianity’s central figure. “It will be something rare, strange, to have archaeological proof for [a specific person] 2,000 years ago,” he concedes, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms over his vestments. “But you can’t say Jesus doesn’t have a trace in history.”Rising from her baptism in the Jordan River, an Indonesian Christian wears a gown depicting Jesus undergoing the same rite in the same river 2,000 years ago. The faith that began as a tiny Jewish sect is now the world’s largest, most diverse religion, with more than two billion believers.By far the most important—and possibly most debated—of those traces are the texts of the New Testament, especially the first four books: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. But how do those ancient texts, written in the second half of the first century, and the traditions they inspired, relate to the work of an archaeologist?“Tradition gives more life to archaeology, and archaeology gives more life to tradition,” Father Alliata replies. “Sometimes they go together well, sometimes not,” he pauses, offering a small smile, “which is more interesting.”And so with Father Alliata’s blessing, I set out to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, retracing his story as told by the Gospel writers and interpreted by generations of scholars. Along the way I hope to discover how Christian texts and traditions stack up against the discoveries of archaeologists who began sifting the sands of the Holy Land in earnest some 150 years ago.But before I begin my pilgrimage, I need to probe an explosive question that lurks in the shadows of historical Jesus studies: Might it be possible that Jesus Christ never even existed, that the whole stained glass story is pure invention? It’s an assertion that’s championed by some outspoken skeptics—but not, I discovered, by scholars, particularly archaeologists, whose work tends to bring flights of fancy down to literal earth.“I don’t know any mainstream scholar who doubts the historicity of Jesus,” said Eric Meyers, an archaeologist and emeritus professor in Judaic studies at Duke University. “The details have been debated for centuries, but no one who is serious doubts that he’s a historical figure.”I heard much the same from Byron McCane, an archaeologist and history professor at Florida Atlantic University. “I can think of no other example who fits into their time and place so well but people say doesn’t exist,” he said.Even John Dominic Crossan, a former priest and co-chair of the Jesus Seminar, a controversial scholarly forum, believes the radical skeptics go too far. Granted, stories of Christ’s miraculous deeds—healing the sick with his words, feeding a multitude with a few morsels of bread and fish, even restoring life to a corpse four days dead—are hard for modern minds to embrace. But that’s no reason to conclude that Jesus of Nazareth was a religious fable.“Now, you can say he walks on water and nobody can do that, so therefore he doesn’t exist. Well, that’s something else,” Crossan told me when we spoke by phone. “The general fact that he did certain things in Galilee, that he did certain things in Jerusalem, that he got himself executed—all of that, I think, fits perfectly into a certain scenario.”Scholars who study Jesus divide into two opposing camps separated by a very bright line: those who believe the wonder-working Jesus of the Gospels is the real Jesus, and those who think the real Jesus—the man who inspired the myth—hides below the surface of the Gospels and must be revealed by historical research and literary analysis. Both camps claim archaeology as their ally, leading to some fractious debates and strange bedfellows.Whoever Jesus Christ was or is—God, man, or the greatest literary hoax in history—the diversity and devotion of his modern disciples are on colorful parade when I arrive in Bethlehem, the ancient city traditionally identified as his birthplace. The tour buses that cross the checkpoint from Jerusalem to the West Bank carry a virtual United Nations of pilgrims. One by one the buses park and discharge their passengers, who emerge blinking in the dazzling sun: Indian women in splashy saris, Spaniards in backpacks emblazoned with the logo of their local parish, Ethiopians in snow-white robes with indigo crucifixes tattooed on their foreheads.I catch up to a group of Nigerian pilgrims in Manger Square and follow them through the low entrance of the Church of the Nativity. The soaring aisles of the basilica are shrouded in tarps and scaffolding. A conservation team is busy cleaning centuries of candle soot from the 12th-century gilded mosaics that flank the upper walls, above elaborately carved cedar beams erected in the sixth century. We carefully circle a section of floor cut open to reveal the earliest incarnation of the church, built in the 330s on orders of Rome’s first Christian emperor, Constantine.Another series of steps takes us down into a lamp-lit grotto and a small marble-clad niche. Here, a silver star marks the very spot where, according to tradition, Jesus Christ was born. The pilgrims ease to their knees to kiss the star and press their palms to the cool, polished stone. Soon a church official entreats them to hurry along and give others a chance to touch the holy rock—and, by faith, the Holy Child.The Church of the Nativity is the oldest Christian church still in daily use, but not all scholars are convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem. Only two of the four Gospels mention his birth, and they provide diverging accounts: the traditional manger and shepherds in Luke; the wise men, massacre of children, and flight to Egypt in Matthew. Some suspect that the Gospel writers located Jesus’ Nativity in Bethlehem to tie the Galilean peasant to the Judaean city prophesied in the Old Testament as the birthplace of the Messiah.Archaeology is largely silent on the matter. After all, what are the odds of unearthing any evidence of a peasant couple’s fleeting visit two millennia ago? Excavations at and around the Church of the Nativity have so far turned up no artifacts dating to the time of Christ, nor any sign that early Christians considered the site sacred. The first clear evidence of veneration comes from the third century, when the theologian Origen of Alexandria visited Palestine and noted, “In Bethlehem there is shown the cave where [Jesus] was born.” Early in the fourth century, the emperor Constantine sent an imperial delegation to the Holy Land to identify places associated with the life of Christ and hallow them with churches and shrines. Having located what they believed was the site of the Nativity grotto, the delegates erected an elaborate church, the forerunner of the present-day basilica.Many of the scholars I spoke to are neutral on the question of Christ’s birthplace, the physical evidence being too elusive to make a call. To their minds, the old adage that I learned in Archaeology 101—“Absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence”—applies here.If the trail of the real Jesus has gone cold in Bethlehem, it grows much warmer 65 miles north in Galilee, the rolling hill country of northern Israel. As the names “Jesus of Nazareth” and “Jesus the Nazarene” suggest, Jesus was raised in Nazareth, a small, agricultural village in southern Galilee. Scholars who understand him in strictly human terms—as a religious reformer, or a social revolutionary, or an apocalyptic prophet, or even a Jewish jihadist—plumb the political, economic, and social currents of first-century Galilee to discover the forces that gave rise to the man and his mission.By far the mightiest force at the time shaping life in Galilee was the Roman Empire, which had subjugated Palestine some 60 years before Jesus’ birth. Almost all Jews chafed under Rome’s ironfisted rule, with its oppressive taxes and idolatrous religion, and many scholars believe this social unrest set the stage for the Jewish agitator who burst onto the scene denouncing the rich and powerful and pronouncing blessings on the poor and marginalized.Unearthed in a synagogue in the hometown of Mary Magdalene, the Magdala Stone is thought to be modeled after the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem and may have served as a ceremonial Torah stand. It’s shown here in Israel’s national treasures storerooms.Others imagine the onslaught of Greco-Roman culture molding Jesus into a less Jewish, more cosmopolitan champion of social justice. In 1991 John Dominic Crossan published a bombshell of a book, The Historical Jesus, in which he put forward the theory that the real Jesus was a wandering sage whose countercultural lifestyle and subversive sayings bore striking parallels to the Cynics. These peripatetic philosophers of ancient Greece, while not cynical in the modern sense of the word, thumbed their unwashed noses at social conventions such as cleanliness and the pursuit of wealth and status.Crossan’s unorthodox thesis was inspired partly by archaeological discoveries showing that Galilee—long thought to have been a rural backwater and an isolated Jewish enclave—was in fact becoming more urbanized and romanized during Jesus’ day than scholars once imagined, and partly by the fact that Jesus’ boyhood home was just three miles from Sepphoris, the Roman provincial capital. Although the city isn’t mentioned in the Gospels, an ambitious building campaign fueled by Galilee’s ruler, Herod Antipas, would have attracted skilled workers from all the surrounding villages. Many scholars think it’s reasonable to imagine Jesus, a young craftsman living nearby, working at Sepphoris—and, like a college freshman, testing the boundaries of his religious upbringing.On a brilliant spring day after rains have left the Galilean hills awash with wildflowers, I hike around the ruins of Sepphoris with Eric and Carol Meyers, the Duke University archaeologists I consulted at the start of my odyssey. The husband-and-wife team spent 33 years excavating the sprawling site, which became the nexus of a heated academic debate about the Jewishness of Galilee and, by extension, of Jesus himself. Eric Meyers, lanky and white-haired, pauses in front of a pile of columns. “It was pretty acrimonious,” he says, recalling the decades-long dispute over the influence of a hellenizing city on a young Jewish peasant. He stops at the top of a hill and waves his hands across a sprawl of neatly excavated walls. “We had to dig through a bivouac from the 1948 war, including a live Syrian shell, to get to these houses,” he explains. “And underneath we found the mikvaot!”At least 30 mikvahs, or Jewish ritual baths, dot the residential quarter of Sepphoris—the largest domestic concentration ever found by archaeologists. Along with ceremonial stone vessels and a striking absence of pig bones (pork being shunned by kosher-keeping Jews), they offer clear evidence that even this imperial Roman city remained a very Jewish place during Jesus’ formative years.This and other insights gleaned from excavations across Galilee have led to a significant shift in scholarly opinion, says Craig Evans, professor of Christian origins in the School of Christian Thought at Houston Baptist University. “Thanks to archaeology, there’s been a big change in thinking—from Jesus the cosmopolitan Hellenist to Jesus the observant Jew.”When Jesus was about 30 years old, he waded into the Jordan River with the Jewish firebrand John the Baptist and, according to New Testament accounts, underwent a life-changing experience. Rising from the water, he saw the Spirit of God descend on him “like a dove” and heard the voice of God proclaim, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” The divine encounter launched Jesus on a preaching and healing mission that began in Galilee and ended, three years later, with his execution in Jerusalem.One of his first stops was Capernaum, a fishing town on the northwest shore of a large freshwater lake called, confusingly, the Sea of Galilee. Here Jesus met the fishermen who became his first followers—Peter and Andrew casting nets, James and John mending theirs—and established his first base of operation.Commonly referred to on the Christian tour route as the “town of Jesus,” the pilgrimage site of Capernaum today is owned by the Franciscans and surrounded by a high metal fence. A sign at the gate makes clear what’s not allowed inside: dogs, guns, cigarettes, and short skirts. Directly beyond the gate is an incongruously modern church mounted on eight pillars that resembles a spaceship hovering above a pile of ruins. This is St. Peter’s Memorial, consecrated in 1990 over one of the biggest discoveries made during the 20th century by archaeologists investigating the historical Jesus.From its odd perch the church offers a stunning view of the lake, but all eyes are drawn to the center of the building, where visitors peer over a railing and through a glass floor into the ruins of an octagonal church built some 1,500 years ago. When Franciscan archaeologists excavated beneath the structure in 1968, they discovered that it had been built on the remains of a first-century house. There was evidence that this private home had been transformed into a public meeting place in a short span of time.By the second half of the first century—just a few decades after the Crucifixion of Jesus—the home’s rough stone walls had been plastered over and household kitchen items replaced with oil lamps, characteristic of a community gathering place. Over the following centuries, entreaties to Christ were etched into the walls, and by the time Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century, the dwelling had been expanded into an elaborately decorated house of worship. Since then the structure has commonly been known as Peter’s House, and while it’s impossible to determine whether the disciple actually inhabited the home, many scholars say it’s possible.The Gospels note that Jesus cured Peter’s mother-in-law, ill with fever, at her home in Capernaum. Word of the miracle spread quickly, and by evening a suffering crowd had gathered at her door. Jesus healed the sick and delivered people possessed by demons.A crucified man’s heel bone found in a family tomb may rebut the charge that Jesus, executed as a criminal, would not have been given a proper burial. Roman crucifixion took many forms.Accounts of large crowds coming to Jesus for healing are consistent with what archaeology reveals about first-century Palestine, where diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis were rife. According to a study of burials in Roman Palestine by archaeologist Byron McCane, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the surveyed graves held the remains of children and adolescents. Survive the perilous years of childhood, and your chances of living to old age greatly increased, McCane says. “During Jesus’ time, getting past 15 was apparently the trick.”From Capernaum I head south along the Sea of Galilee to a kibbutz (a communal farm) that in 1986 was the scene of great excitement—and an emergency excavation. A severe drought had drastically lowered the lake’s water level, and as two brothers from the community hunted for ancient coins in the mud of the exposed lake bed, they spotted the faint outline of a boat. Archaeologists who examined the vessel found artifacts dating to the Roman era inside and next to the hull. Carbon 14 testing later confirmed the boat’s age: It was from roughly the lifetime of Jesus.Efforts to keep the discovery under wraps soon failed, and news of the “Jesus boat” sent a stampede of relic hunters scouring the lakeshore, threatening the fragile artifact. Just then the rains returned, and the lake level began to rise.The round-the-clock “rescue excavation” that ensued was an archaeological feat for the record books. A project that normally would take months to plan and execute was completed, start to finish, in just 11 days. Once exposed to air, the boat’s waterlogged timbers would quickly disintegrate. So archaeologists supported the remains with a fiberglass frame and polyurethane foam and floated it to safety.Today the treasured boat has pride of place in a museum on the kibbutz, near the spot where it was discovered. Measuring seven and a half feet wide and 27 feet long, it could have accommodated 13 men—although there’s no evidence that Jesus and his Twelve Apostles used this very vessel. To be candid, it’s not much to look at: a skeleton of planks repeatedly patched and repaired until it was finally stripped and scuttled.“They had to nurse this boat along until they couldn’t nurse it any longer,” says Crossan, who likens the vessel to “some of those cars you see in Havana.” But its value to historians is incalculable, he says. Seeing “how hard they had to work to keep that boat afloat tells me a lot about the economics of the Sea of Galilee and the fishing at the time of Jesus.”Another dramatic discovery occurred just over a mile south of the Jesus boat, at the site of ancient Magdala, the hometown of Mary Magdalene, a devoted follower of Jesus. Franciscan archaeologists began excavating part of the town during the 1970s, but the northern half lay under a defunct lakeside resort called Hawaii Beach.Enter Father Juan Solana, a papal appointee charged with overseeing a pilgrimage guesthouse in Jerusalem. In 2004 Solana “felt the leading of Christ” to build a pilgrims’ retreat in Galilee, so he set about raising millions of dollars and buying up parcels of waterfront land, including the failed resort. As construction was about to begin in 2009, archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority showed up to survey the site, as required by law. After a few weeks of probing the rocky soil, they were startled to discover the buried ruins of a synagogue from the time of Jesus—the first such structure unearthed in Galilee.The find was especially significant because it put to rest an argument made by skeptics that no synagogues existed in Galilee until decades after Jesus’ death. If those skeptics were right, their claim would shred the Gospels’ portrait of Jesus as a faithful synagogue-goer who often proclaimed his message and performed miracles in these Jewish meeting places.As archaeologists excavated the ruins, they uncovered walls lined with benches—indicating that this was a synagogue—and a mosaic floor. At the center of the room they were astounded to find a stone about the size of a footlocker that showed the most sacred elements of the Temple in Jerusalem carved in relief. The discovery of the Magdala Stone, as the artifact has come to be called, struck a death blow to the once fashionable notion that Galileans were impious hillbillies detached from Israel’s religious center.As archaeologists continued to dig, they discovered an entire town buried less than a foot below the surface. The ruins were so well preserved that some began calling Magdala the “Israeli Pompeii.”Archaeologist Dina Avshalom-Gorni walks me through the site, pointing out the remains of storerooms, ritual baths, and an industrial area where fish may have been processed and sold. “I can just imagine women buying fish in the market right there,” she says, nodding toward the foundations of stone stalls. And who knows? Maybe those women included the town’s famous native daughter, Mary of Magdala.Father Solana comes over to greet us, and I ask him what he tells visitors who want to know whether Jesus ever walked these streets. “We can’t expect to answer that,” he admits, “but we see the number of times that the Gospels mention Jesus in a Galilee synagogue.” Considering the fact that the synagogue was active during his ministry and just a brief sail from Capernaum, Solana concludes, “we have no reason to deny or doubt that Jesus was here.”At each stop on my journey through Galilee, Jesus’ faint footprints seemed to grow a bit more distinct, a shade more discernible. But it’s not until I return to Jerusalem that they finally come into vivid focus. In the New Testament, the ancient city is the setting for many of his miracles and most dramatic moments: his triumphal entry, his cleansing of the Temple, his healing miracles at the Pools of Bethesda and Siloam—both of which have been uncovered by archaeologists—his clashes with the religious authorities, his last Passover meal, his agonized prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, his trial and execution, his burial and Resurrection.Unlike the disparate stories of Jesus’ birth, the four Gospels reach much closer agreement in their account of his death. Following his arrival in Jerusalem for Passover, Jesus is brought before the high priest Caiaphas and charged with blasphemy and threats against the Temple. Condemned to death by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, he’s crucified on a hill outside the city walls and buried in a rock-cut tomb nearby.The traditional location of that tomb, in what is now the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, is considered the holiest site in Christianity. It’s also the place that sparked my quest for the real Jesus. In 2016 I made several trips to the church to document the historic restoration of the Edicule, the shrine that houses the reputed tomb of Jesus. Now, during Easter week, I return to see it in all its soot-scrubbed, reinforced glory.Standing shoulder to shoulder with holiday pilgrims waiting to enter the tiny shrine, I recall the nights spent inside the empty church with the conservation team, coming upon darkened nooks etched with centuries of graffiti and burials of crusader kings. I marvel at the many archaeological discoveries made in Jerusalem and elsewhere over the years that lend credibility to the Scriptures and traditions surrounding the death of Jesus, including an ornate ossuary that may contain the bones of Caiaphas, an inscription attesting to the rule of Pontius Pilate, and a heel bone driven through with an iron crucifixion nail, found in the Jerusalem burial of a Jewish man named Yehohanan.I’m also struck by the many lines of evidence that converge on this ancient church. Just yards from the tomb of Christ are other rock-hewn tombs of the period, affirming that this church, destroyed and rebuilt twice, was indeed constructed over a Jewish burial ground. I recall being alone inside the tomb after its marble cladding was briefly removed, overwhelmed that I was looking at one of the world’s most important monuments—a simple limestone shelf that people have revered for millennia, a sight that hadn’t been seen for possibly a thousand years. I was overwhelmed by all the questions of history I hoped this brief and spectacular moment of exposure would eventually answer.Today, on my Easter visit, I find myself inside the tomb again, squeezed alongside three kerchiefed Russian women. The marble is back in place, protecting the burial bed from their kisses and all the rosaries and prayer cards rubbed endlessly on its time-polished surface. The youngest woman whispers entreaties for Jesus to heal her son Yevgeni, who has leukemia.A priest standing outside the entrance loudly reminds us that our time is up, that other pilgrims are waiting. Reluctantly, the women stand up and file out, and I follow. At this moment I realize that to sincere believers, the scholars’ quest for the historical, non-supernatural Jesus is of little consequence. That quest will be endless, full of shifting theories, unanswerable questions, irreconcilable facts. But for true believers, their faith in the life, death, and Resurrection of the Son of God will be evidence enough.",
"Built in the sixth century at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt, St. Catherine’s Monastery is the world’s oldest such institution in continuous use. Its library preserves hundreds of manuscripts collected during medieval times—classical texts, scriptures, and other documents of interest to the monks. But it turns out that people recycled the pages of some of those manuscripts, erasing texts they no longer needed. Since 2011 the monastery has been working to recover some of those long-lost erasures using modern digital technology.About half of the library’s manuscripts were written on parchment, the specially prepared skin of a calf, goat, or sheep. Parchment can be recycled by scraping off any ink and writing on the fresh surface. The old text isn’t entirely gone, though. It remains embedded in the page as a ghostly shadow, which can be resurrected with a technique called multispectral imaging, designed to peer into both visible and invisible wavelengths of light.So far the imaging has revealed some 6,800 hidden pages in 74 of the monastery’s 163 recycled parchments, called palimpsests. “We have identified erased texts in 10 languages that date from the fifth to the 12th centuries,” says Michael Phelps, the director of the recovery effort. In the example above, a text in Syriac overlays a ninth-century translation of a page from a medical treatise by the ancient Greco-Roman physician known as Galen.With dozens of palimpsests yet to be scanned, Phelps believes there are still treasures to come: “It’s not unlikely that St. Catherine’s holds many more pages of previously unidentified and unstudied texts from antiquity.”",
"The Museum of the Bible, which opened to the public on November 17, 2017, is a $500-million monument to the world’s most popular book. Few artifacts capture the scripture’s timelessness more than the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest known copies of Biblical text—which is why the museum’s founders are rumored to have spent millions of dollars to obtain 16 of them for their collection.However, research suggests that some of the fragments that visitors will encounter may be modern forgeries. On October 22, 2018, the Museum of the Bible announced that five of its 16 Dead Sea Scrolls fragments are probably modern forgeries, based on analyses conducted by Germany's Federal Institute for Materials Research. The report corroborates concerns raised by biblical scholars in 2017, just before the Museum of the Bible opened."Though we had hoped the testing would render different results, this is an opportunity to educate the public on the importance of verifying the authenticity of rare biblical artifacts, the elaborate testing process undertaken and our commitment to transparency," said Jeffrey Kloha, chief curatorial officer for Museum of the Bible, in a statement. "As an educational institution entrusted with cultural heritage, the museum upholds and adheres to all museum and ethical guidelines on collection care, research and display."The spotlights on the Museum of the Bible burn especially bright. The museum’s founder Steve Green, who owns the Hobby Lobby craft chain, has faced intense public scrutiny for his company’s antiquities purchases, including 5,500 ancient clay tablets that U.S. authorities claim were illegally smuggled into the country. In July, Hobby Lobby reached a settlement on the tablets with the Department of Justice. The company has returned the artifacts to Iraq.While some scholars have derided the museum for aggressive acquisition practices, Green and museum officials stress that they received poor advice in their early collecting days, and that the Museum of the Bible abides by academic best practices.Widely respected Biblical scholar David Trobisch now directs the collection—and the Museum of the Bible has supported the very work on the Dead Sea Scrolls which has uncovered evidence of forgery.“Anybody who thinks that in a gigantic museum that there’s going to be no item [with disputed authenticity], it’s like believing that there’s no amoeba in your water,” says New York University Biblical scholar Lawrence Schiffman, who consulted the museum on its presentation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. “The museum did everything they’re supposed to do.”Discovered by a Bedouin shepherd in the caves of Qumran, the Dead Sea Scrolls consist of passages of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament, that range from 1,800 to more than 2,000 years old. They comprise the oldest copies of Biblical text ever found. (See digital copies of the Dead Sea Scrolls.)From 1947 to 1953, many of the scrolls were purchased from Bedouin by the local merchant Khalil Iskander Shahin (also known as Kando), who then sold them to collectors and academic institutions. But once the 1970 UNESCO convention on cultural property kicked in, the illicit excavation and selling of newfound scrolls was made illegal.Today, many of the Dead Sea Scrolls—which total some 100,000 fragments—are housed in the Shrine of the Book, part of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. The private market fights for the literal scraps grandfathered into current law, mostly pieces that entered private collections before 1970.In the early 2000s, about 75 grandfathered-in fragments—most no bigger than large coins—were put up for sale, many by Kando’s relatives. Sixteen of the fragments were purchased by the Green family from 2009 to 2014. Many of these “post-2002” fragments aren’t academically revelatory: Their texts mirror content known from earlier Dead Sea Scrolls. Nevertheless, museums and private collectors jumped at the chance to claim physical ownership of some of the earliest known Biblical texts."Any reputable Bible museum almost has to have Dead Sea Scrolls," said Trobisch, the museum’s director, in a 2017 interview with CNN’s Daniel Burke.At the time of these purchases, Schiffman says that the post-2002 fragments were largely considered authentic. But this consensus began to unravel in early 2016, when University of Leuven researcher Eibert Tigchelaar challenged the authenticity of several fragments held by Norwegian collector Martin Schøyen. Tigchelaar’s efforts quickly snowballed.“It took a long time to come to the point where I became convinced… [that] a few of these are probably not authentic—at least a few,” says Kipp Davis, a Dead Sea Scrolls expert at Trinity Western University who has closely studied post-2002 fragments.In interviews last year, Schiffman and Davis noted that while the field is now wary of forgeries, some highly respected scholars still believed the new fragments to be genuine. Schiffman said that at least a few of the post-2002 fragments must be real, since they fit into authentic Dead Sea Scrolls like puzzle pieces. (Who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?)This Dead Sea Scroll-like fragment, one of 16 in the Museum of the Bible's collection, contains part of the Book of Genesis. At present, isn't one of the suspected forgeries. Like authentic Dead Sea Scrolls, its text runs in largely parallel lines, and its lettering marks the handiwork of a skilled scribe.In a 2017 interview with CNN, leading Dead Sea Scrolls scholar Emanuel Tov said that he didn't think the fragments are fake. "I will not say the Museum of the Bible has no inauthentic fragments," he said at the time. "I will say I have not seen the proof."Other scholars, however, err on the side of forgery. “I think that over 90 percent of the post-2002 fragments most probably are modern forgeries,” says University of Agder researcher Årstein Justnes, who leads the Lying Pen of Scribes project, which monitors the post-2002 fragments.If some of the Museum of the Bible's Dead Sea Scroll fragments are in fact forgeries, how did they come about?For starters, while at least one post-2002 parchment fragment in another collection has reportedly been carbon-dated—a result that Davis finds suspicious—microscopic mistakes in the writing suggest that the ink was laid down in modern times. (Recently, archaeologists discovered blank parchment in one of the Dead Sea Scroll caves.)In some examples Davis has examined from the Norwegian Schøyen Collection, ink sits atop the ancient parchment’s patina, or bleeds over the fragments’ tattered edges, as if the ink was laid down centuries or millennia later. One manuscript was even found covered in modern table salt, which forgers apparently used to mimic the salty crust on authentic Dead Sea Scrolls.Research on the Museum of the Bible’s fragments continues; scholars took their first stab at them in 2016, in a 236-page volume co-edited by Tov and Davis. Even then, researchers supported by the museum, including Davis, had flagged possible signs of forgery in some of the museum’s fragments—including one that was on display when the museum first opened.In that fragment, a passage from the Book of Jonah, one Hebrew character is squeezed into a corner that wouldn’t have been there when the parchment was whole. The lines of text also seem to follow the contours of the fragment’s torn edges. “These [lines of text] are probably not authentic,” says Davis. “It looks more like the letters were applied to something that has already deteriorated.”In a separate Museum of the Bible fragment that’s not currently on display, the Hebrew text—a portion of the Book of Nehemiah—is interrupted by what looks like the Greek letter alpha. The Greek letter appears in the same passage in a Hebrew Bible published in 1937; the character denotes a footnote.As scientific work continued, the museum had installed placards under each of the fragments that were on display, which read:“In 2002, dozens of previously known ‘Dead Sea Scroll’ fragments began appearing with antiquity dealers. Universities, museums, and private collectors acquired many of these ‘new’ fragments. As scholars began to study them, some noted puzzling features and labeled them as forgeries.“[The Museum of the Bible] published the initial research on its scroll fragments in 2016, but scholarly opinions of their authenticity remain divided. Scientific analysis of the ink and handwriting on these pieces continues.”Now, the Museum of the Bible says that all five fragments that were on display were probably forgeries. It has now replaced them with three other fragments that haven't been chemically analyzed yet. Placards will still be displayed beside them.Schiffman, who wrote the placard text, said at the museum's opening that its staff had done their job to be transparent with visitors. Now, it’s a matter of uncovering the fragments’ true origin story.“What we need now is a detective,” he said.",
"All three of Giza's famed pyramids and their elaborate burial complexes were built during a frenetic period of construction, from roughly 2550 to 2490 B.C. The pyramids were built by Pharaohs Khufu (tallest), Khafre (background), and Menkaure (front).The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental tombs are relics of Egypt's Old Kingdom era and were constructed some 4,500 years ago.Egypt's pharaohs expected to become gods in the afterlife. To prepare for the next world they erected temples to the gods and massive pyramid tombs for themselves—filled with all the things each ruler would need to guide and sustain himself in the next world.Pharaoh Khufu began the first Giza pyramid project, circa 2550 B.C. His Great Pyramid is the largest in Giza and towers some 481 feet (147 meters) above the plateau. Its estimated 2.3 million stone blocks each weigh an average of 2.5 to 15 tons.Khufu's son, Pharaoh Khafre, built the second pyramid at Giza, circa 2520 B.C. His necropolis also included the Sphinx, a mysterious limestone monument with the body of a lion and a pharaoh's head. The Sphinx may stand sentinel for the pharaoh's entire tomb complex.The third of the Giza Pyramids is considerably smaller than the first two. Built by Pharaoh Menkaure circa 2490 B.C., it featured a much more complex mortuary temple.Each massive pyramid is but one part of a larger complex, including a palace, temples, solar boat pits, and other features.The ancient engineering feats at Giza were so impressive that even today scientists can't be sure how the pyramids were built. Yet they have learned much about the people who built them and the political power necessary to make it happen.The builders were skilled, well-fed Egyptian workers who lived in a nearby temporary city. Archaeological digs on the fascinating site have revealed a highly organized community, rich with resources, that must have been backed by strong central authority.It's likely that communities across Egypt contributed workers, as well as food and other essentials, for what became in some ways a national project to display the wealth and control of the ancient pharaohs.Such revelations have led Zahi Hawass, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities and a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, to note that in one sense it was the Pyramids that built Egypt—rather than the other way around.If the Pyramids helped to build ancient Egypt, they also preserved it. Giza allows us to explore a long-vanished world."Many people think of the site as just a cemetery in the modern sense, but it's a lot more than that," says Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Tufts University Egyptologist Peter Der Manuelian. "In these decorated tombs you have wonderful scenes of every aspect of life in ancient Egypt—so it's not just about how Egyptians died but how they lived."Tomb art includes depictions of ancient farmers working their fields and tending livestock, fishing and fowling, carpentry, costumes, religious rituals, and burial practices.Inscriptions and texts also allow research into Egyptian grammar and language. "Almost any subject you want to study about Pharaonic civilization is available on the tomb walls at Giza," Der Manuelian says.To help make these precious resources accessible to all, Der Manuelian heads the Giza Archives Project, an enormous collection of Giza photographs, plans, drawings, manuscripts, object records, and expedition diaries that enables virtual visits to the plateau.Older records preserve paintings or inscriptions that have since faded away, capture artifacts that have been lost or destroyed, and unlock tombs not accessible to the public.Armed with the output of the longest-running excavations ever at Giza, the Harvard-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Expedition (1902-47), Der Manuelian hopes to add international content and grow the archive into the world's central online repository for Giza-related material.But he stresses that nothing could ever replicate, or replace, the experience of a personal visit to Giza.Tourism to the structures has declined rapidly since the advent of the Arab Spring in 2011, when Egypt experienced a political upheaval that lasted years. The country has since been through several administration changes, and the instability means the future of tourism to the Pyramids is uncertain.",
"This bust of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti was made before she commanded that no more images be made of her as a woman—but only as a ruler. A new book by Kara Cooney, When Women Ruled the World: Six Queens of Egypt, suggests that Egypt gained stability by allowing periods of rule by women.A woman has yet to be elected to the highest office in the United States, but 3,000 years ago in ancient Egypt it wasn’t unusual for women to rule—and some became all powerful, like Cleopatra and Nefertiti. Yet as Kara Cooney explains in her new book, When Women Ruled the World: Six Queens of Egypt, those women were ultimately only placeholders for the next male to take the pharaoh’s throne.When National Geographic caught up with Cooney by phone in Los Angeles, she explained why Hatshepsut was so perfect; how Cleopatra grew up in a family that makes the Sopranos seem like lambs; and what these women symbolize for their society—and ours.That’s a giant question so, as the academics say, let me unpack it. Growing up as a Ptolemy must have been a PTSD-inducing experience. Every Ptolemy son or daughter had their own entourage, their treasuries, their own sources of power and also shared power, but within a very exclusive system of siblings.And killed each other with impunity and regularity. My favorite Ptolemaic story is Cleopatra II, who was married to her brother. They got in a massive argument and the brother was killed. Then she married another brother. Her daughter, Cleopatra III, then ended up overthrowing her mother and taking up with her uncle, Cleopatra II’s brother, kicking the mother out into exile. The uncle then sent her (Cleopatra II) a package containing her own son, cut up into little bits, as a birthday present. Then they all get back together for political reasons. [laughs ironically]Cleopatra is probably the only woman in our story who uses her reproductive abilities like a man, to create a legacy. The other women are either ruling on behalf of a younger child or they’re ruling because there is no male offspring and are stepping in during years when they couldn’t produce any children. Cleopatra used her productive womb to have children with two Roman warlords. She had one child with Julius Caesar, three children with Mark Antony—twins, no less—and she survived it. She then carefully placed each child in charge of a different part of her growing Eastern Empire, in competition with the Western Roman Empire. If it weren’t for the boneheaded decisions made by Antony, the Roman warlord she was partnered with, we would maybe talk about her and her legacy differently.She has come down to us as a great beauty, but we have to assume that she was partially a product of incest. And incest did not make people beautiful. I am thinking of Charles II’s giant head, how he needed special pillows and couldn’t chew. Cleopatra’s coinage doesn’t show her as a great beauty. What is written about her talks, rather, of her wit, conversation, and intelligence. Whatever it was that drew these Roman warlords to her, she used it. She used personal connections better than any of the other women in our story.Nefertiti is the trickiest of our women to talk about because she is only just now being discovered by Egyptologists for what she was. That is, a leader of her people. We have thus far only discussed her as a beauty, as evidenced by the bust in Berlin’s Neues Museum. But when she became a political leader she changed her identity. She had herself renamed and was no longer depicted in that feminine way.When I say that Nefertiti was the most successful of our feminine leaders what I mean is that she cleaned up the mess that the men before her had made. She used her feminine emotionality to do so. She wasn’t interested in her own ambition. She didn’t even claim it in a way historians can talk about her as having been in power. She hid all the evidence of herself having taken power.Egyptologists still fiercely debate whether she became co-king at all, and certainly whether she became sole king. If she did, she had to erase her feminine identity of beauty and allurability. That, right there, speaks volumes about what political power is—and what it does to a woman.The United States is no exception. Most of the world has an aversion to powerful female leaders. I would also caution anybody who believes that they’re more enlightened because they have had female leaders of state. The places where female leaders were elected are parliamentary systems where you have no direct election, one person, one vote. You elect your parliamentary representative and they then elect your prime minister. You see that in Britain or India, and other places around the world, that when a female is elected, there is no direct, organic vote.Number one: My book is a tragedy. [laughs] I’m not here to write revisionist history. I am here to say it the way I see it. These women in ancient Egypt were serving a patriarchy, in a context of social inequality. They were stepping in to support their husbands, brothers, or sons. The reason Egypt had women rulers again and again is because Egypt was very risk-averse and wanted a divine kingship to survive no matter what. The Egyptians knew that women ruled differently, that they weren’t warlords or rapists, they weren’t going to throttle you in the night. Not that they’re not capable of murder. But fewer women commit violent crimes today and we should assume that it was the same in the ancient world.She left Egypt better than she found it! She put Egypt and her dynasty onto a secure footing and created the next king, Thutmose III, who ended up being the Napoleon of Egypt, enlarging its empire beyond anything it had ever seen. She was very canny in how she used ideology to set herself up with unassailable power. She told her people: “The God has chosen me, it’s not my own ambition, it’s not my own wish but my father, the God Amon-Re has spoken to me and told me that I must do this.”The reason I’m so drawn to Hatshepsut is because she did everything so perfectly, which is something that is idealized. Success is very fungible. It’s something that someone else can claim and take credit for. Her name can easily be removed from a set of reliefs showing her building obelisks or sending expeditions to the land of Punt, and another name put in her place.Failure, on the other hand, is not abstract. [laughs] It involves suicide with asps or naval battles where everything goes horribly wrong. It’s something that is very individualized. Thus, we remember Cleopatra. Shakespeare wrote a play about her. But Hatshepsut we must resurrect from the ashes of history and investigate why female success is so easily ignored, while female failure is so beautifully aggrandized.The women were placeholders for a much larger scheme of power that is dependent on masculinity. They were there to make sure the next male in line could step into the power circle. Simple biology helps us understand that it’s harder for a woman to be at the center of the circle. She can only have one, maybe two children a year. Whereas, a man can produce hundreds of children, without all the hormonal changes and the vulnerability it produces. So, she is there at a moment of crisis to protect the patriarchy when something goes wrong with the succession from man to man. As soon as it can go back to the patriarchal system, she is removed. Five of the six women in this book were called King. But that doesn’t mean that they won’t be erased a few generations later when it’s expedient for the men to remove them from the story, and claim that success outright for themselves.Number one: We need to understand that if racism is something that is inherent to our biology, then sexism could be as well. Until we start to verbalize and discuss what form that takes, we will not be able to transcend it.Number two: What we think of as the greatest problem in a female, her emotionality, that ability to cry or feel someone else’s pain, could be the only thing that gets us through the 21st century intact. It is that emotionality that causes women to commit less violent acts, not want to wage war and be more nuanced in their decision-making. It is what pulls the hand away from the red button rather than slamming the fist down upon it. These women ruled in a way that kept the men around them safe and ensured their dynasties continued.These women are whispering to me from the past that we need to do things differently. The thing that pulls me to them the strongest is their protectiveness; their ability to work with others; their interest in nuance; trying to build bridges rather than burn them. That it’s not all about masculine aggression and economic growth. If these women can tell us anything, it’s to look to the future rather than the short-term solutions; and look to our children and grandchildren.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall is a frequent contributor to National Geographic, both the print magazine and online.

"Reading the news these days is often a depressing and anxiety inducing task. Mass shootings, pipe bombs, assassinations, and—over it all—climate change haunt the discussion. The sources of these modern human malignancies are generally the same: male leaders who want to maintain economic, political, and religious power no matter the cost. It begs the question: Might women rule differently from men? If history is any indicator, the answer is yes.The ancient Egyptians certainly believed in the wisdom of female rulers. Indeed, when there was a political crisis, the ancient Egyptians chose a woman time and again to fill the power vacuum—precisely because she was the least risky option. For the ancient Egyptians, placing women in power was often the best protection for the patriarchy in times of uncertainty.Compared to other states of the time, the kingdom of Egypt was different. Natural boundaries of deserts and sea protected it from the constant invasions, warlording, and aggression that Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia, Greece, or Rome endured. In these lands, if a young child took the throne, it would be a call to military competition to seize it from him. But in Egypt, where sovereigns, no matter how young, were revered as god-kings, women protected them. Rather than see the child as an obstacle to power, mothers, aunts, sisters would defended the youths at the center of the wheel of power. This stabilizing tendency was employed repeatedly in Egypt’s history.In the first dynasty (ca. 3000-2890 B.C.), when her husband King Djet died, Queen Merneith stepped into power on behalf of her young son, instead of allowing an uncle to serve as regent and manipulate his nephew. Merneith was the first documented queen regent who shepherded her son to the throne and insured stability in Egypt. In the 12th dynasty (ca. 1985-1773 B.C.), when inbreeding (or other factors) meant there was no crown prince to take the throne at all, Neferusobek, the wife of the dead king, stepped forward to rule and guided Egypt until another dynasty was ready to rule.Depicted as a sphinx, the pharoah Hatshepsut dons a lion's main as well as the traditional king's beard.In Dynasty 18 (ca. 1550-1295 B.C.), a new trailblazer led Egypt during an era of growth and prosperity. When the king died after only three years on the throne, a mere toddler became pharaoh; the boy’s aunt stepped into the breach, and the era of Hatshepsut began. She led Egypt for more than two decades, the longest of any female king, and left the kingdom better than she found it.Later in Dynasty 18, when King Akhenaten foisted religious extremism upon his people, he made his wife Nefertiti his co-ruler. She must have been the safest option of holding power, and it was arguably she who had to clean up his mess after his death. In Dynasty 19 (1295-1186 B.C.), another woman, Queen Tawosret, was placed as regent for a boy (not her own son) and even allowed to rule as king after his death, but she was no match for the warlord who removed her from power with impunity, seizing the crown for himself.This black basalt statue of Cleopatra is one of the few surviving depictions of the last pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty.Best known of all was Cleopatra of the Ptolemaic Dynasty (305-285 B.C.), who eliminated her siblings to take the throne unaccosted, only to put all of her energies into creating a dynasty for her many children. In the end, even this seducer of Roman leaders ruled differently than her partner of the moment, Marc Antony. While he was the (defeated) aggressor in Parthia, she stayed in Egypt and tried to create calm. While he foolishly engaged in the Battle of Actium, she saw the writing on the wall and fled with her fleet, back to Egypt, where she could do some good.History shows that the Egyptians knew that women ruled differently from men. And so they used them to protect the patriarchy, to act as stopgaps, placeholders, until the next man could fill the top spot on the social pyramid. But no matter how much power they held, even though many of them were called nothing less than King, these formidable women of ancient Egypt were not able to transcend the patriarchal agenda and change the system itself. When their reigns ended, the masculine Egyptian power structure remained intact.For thousands of years, women have ruled in remote villages and reigned over major empires. Here, a Mongolian princess poses for a portrait in full court dress in the 1920s.Cognitive scientists know that the female brain is different from the male. Social scientists have found that men are most responsible for violent crime, including rape and homicide. On the whole, women are less likely to commit mass murder, less inclined to start a war, more likely to be in touch with and express their emotions, and more interested in nuance, rather than decisiveness. Perhaps these qualities were what ancient Egypt sought in times of crisisThese queens call out from the past, challenging us to place women into political power, not as representatives of a patriarchal dynasty, but as women who serve their own, different agendas of social connection and emotional cohesion, instead of aping the aggression of their fathers, brothers, and sons. If a long time ago, women really did rule the world, they were able to do so even without feminism, without a sisterhood, without their own agenda, without their own long term hold on power.It’s time to look to history, to the powerful women of ancient Egypt who were the salvation of their people again and again. What if today they were allowed to rule with the full force of their emotions–using their emotions—that trait most demonized about women–their ups and downs, their sadness and joy, their mercurial natures? Could this trait be harnessed to connect with others, to find compromise, to take the finger off the trigger, to look to a nuanced solution? It is this element of emotionality that could lead humanity through the trials and tribulations of the 21st century. We should let ancient history be our guide and let women be our salvation once more, this time with their own interests front and center.",
"There was something strangely touching about her fingertips. Everywhere else about her person all human grace had vanished. The raveled linen around her neck looked like a fashion statement gone horribly awry. Her mouth, with the upper lip shelved over the lower, was a gruesome crimp. (She came from a famous lineage of overbites.) Her eye sockets were packed with blind black resin, her nostrils unbecomingly plugged with tight rolls of cloth. Her left ear had sunk into the flesh on the side of her skull, and her head was almost completely without hair.I leaned toward the open display case in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and gazed at what in all likelihood is the body of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut, the extraordinary woman who ruled Egypt from 1479 to 1458 B.C. and is famous today less for her reign during the golden age of Egypt's 18th dynasty than for having the audacity to portray herself as a man. There was no beguiling myrrh perfume in the air, only some sharp and sour smell that seemed minted during the many centuries she had spent in a limestone cave. It was hard to square this prostrate thing with the great ruler who lived so long ago and of whom it was written, "To look upon her was more beautiful than anything." The only human touch was in the bone shine of her nailless fingertips where the mummified flesh had shrunk back, creating the illusion of a manicure and evoking not just our primordial vanity but our tenuous intimacies, our brief and passing feel for the world.The discovery of Hatshepsut's lost mummy made headlines two summers ago, but the full story unfolded slowly, in increments, a forensic drama more along the lines of CSI than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indeed the search for Hatshepsut showed the extent to which the trowels and brushes of archaeology's traditional toolbox have been supplemented by CT scanners and DNA gradient thermocyclers.In 1903 the renowned archaeologist Howard Carter had found Hatshepsut's sarcophagus in the 20th tomb discovered in the Valley of the Kings—KV20. The sarcophagus, one of three Hatshepsut had prepared, was empty. Scholars did not know where her mummy was or whether it had even survived the campaign to eradicate the record of her rule during the reign of her co-regent and ultimate successor, Thutmose III, when almost all the images of her as king were systematically chiseled off temples, monuments, and obelisks. The search that seems to have finally solved the mystery was launched in 2005 by Zahi Hawass, head of the Egyptian Mummy Project and secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. Hawass and a team of scientists zeroed in on a mummy they called KV60a, which had been discovered more than a century earlier but wasn't thought significant enough to remove from the floor of a minor tomb in the Valley of the Kings. KV60a had been cruising eternity without even the hospitality of a coffin, much less a retinue of figurines to perform royal chores. She had nothing to wear, either—no headdress, no jewelry, no gold sandals or gold toe and finger coverings, none of the treasures that had been provided the pharaoh Tutankhamun, who was a pip-squeak of a king compared with Hatshepsut.A grand expression of royal power, Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple rises against a desert bluff at Deir el Bahri. Reliefs in the porticoes record the greatest triumphs of her 21-year reign.And even with all the high-tech methods used to crack one of Egypt's most notable missing person cases, if it had not been for the serendipitous discovery of a tooth, KV60a might still be lying alone in the dark, her royal name and status unacknowledged. Today she is enshrined in one of the two Royal Mummy Rooms at the Egyptian Museum, with plaques in Arabic and English proclaiming her to be Hatshepsut, the King Herself, reunited at long last with her extended family of fellow New Kingdom pharaohs.Given the oblivion that befell Hatshepsut, it's hard to think of a pharaoh whose hopes of being remembered are more poignant. She seems to have been more afraid of anonymity than of death. She was one of the greatest builders in one of the greatest Egyptian dynasties. She raised and renovated temples and shrines from the Sinai to Nubia. The four granite obelisks she erected at the vast temple of the great god Amun at Karnak were among the most magnificent ever constructed. She commissioned hundreds of statues of herself and left accounts in stone of her lineage, her titles, her history, both real and concocted, even her thoughts and hopes, which at times she confided with uncommon candor. Expressions of worry Hatshepsut inscribed on one of her obelisks at Karnak still resonate with an almost charming insecurity: "Now my heart turns this way and that, as I think what the people will say. Those who see my monuments in years to come, and who shall speak of what I have done."Many uncertainties plague the early history of the New Kingdom, but it's clear that when Hatshepsut was born, Egyptian power was waxing. Her possible grandfather Ahmose, founder of the 18th dynasty, had driven out the formidable Hyksos invaders who had occupied the northern part of the Nile Valley for two centuries. When Ahmose's son Amenhotep I did not produce a son who lived to succeed him, a redoubtable general known as Thutmose is believed to have been brought into the royal line since he had married a princess.Hatshepsut was the oldest daughter of Thutmose and his Great Royal Wife, Queen Ahmose, likely a close relative of King Ahmose. But Thutmose also had a son by another queen, and this son, Thutmose II, inherited the crown when his father "rested from life." Adhering to a common method of fortifying the royal lineage—and with none of our modern-day qualms about sleeping with your sister—Thutmose II and Hatshepsut married. They produced one daughter; a minor wife, Isis, would give Thutmose the male heir that Hatshepsut was unable to provide.Thutmose II did not rule for long, and when he was ushered into the afterlife by what CT scans 3,500 years later would suggest was heart disease, his heir, Thutmose III, was still a young boy. In time-honored fashion, Hatshepsut assumed effective control as the young pharaoh's queen regent.So began one of the most intriguing periods of ancient Egyptian history.At first, Hatshepsut acted on her stepson's behalf, careful to respect the conventions under which previous queens had handled political affairs while juvenile offspring learned the ropes. But before long, signs emerged that Hatshepsut's regency would be different. Early reliefs show her performing kingly functions such as making offerings to the gods and ordering up obelisks from red granite quarries at Aswan. After just a few years she had assumed the role of "king" of Egypt, supreme power in the land. Her stepson—who by then may have been fully capable of assuming the throne—was relegated to second-in-command. Hatshepsut proceeded to rule for a total of 21 years.What induced Hatshepsut to break so radically with the traditional role of queen regent? A social or military crisis? Dynastic politics? Divine injunctions from Amun? A thirst for power? "There was something impelling Hatshepsut to change the way she portrayed herself on public monuments, but we don't know what it is," says Peter Dorman, a noted Egyptologist and president of the American University of Beirut. "One of the hardest things to guess is her motive."Bloodlines may have had something to do with it. On a cenotaph at the sandstone quarries of Gebel el Silsila, her chief steward and architect Senenmut refers to her as "the king's firstborn daughter," a distinction that accents her lineage as the senior heir of Thutmose I rather than as the chief royal wife of Thutmose II. Remember, Hatshepsut was a true blue blood, related to the pharaoh Ahmose, while her husband-brother was the offspring of an adopted king. The Egyptians believed in the divinity of the pharaoh; only Hatshepsut, not her stepson, had a biological link to divine royalty.Still, there was the small matter of gender. The kingship was meant to be passed down from father to son, not daughter; religious belief dictated that the king's role could not be adequately carried out by a woman. Getting over this hurdle must have taken great shrewdness from the female king. When her husband died, Hatshepsut's preferred title was not King's Wife, but God's Wife of Amun, a designation some believe paved her way to the throne.Hatshepsut never made a secret of her sex in texts; her inscriptions frequently employed feminine endings. But in the early going, she seemed to be looking for ways to synthesize the images of queen and king, as if a visual compromise might resolve the paradox of a female sovereign. In one seated red granite statue, Hatshepsut is shown with the unmistakable body of a woman but with the striped nemes headdress and uraeus cobra, symbols of a king. In some temple reliefs, Hatshepsut is dressed in a traditional restrictive ankle-length gown but with her feet wide apart in the striding pose of the king.As the years went on, she seems to have decided it was easier to sidestep the issue of gender altogether. She had herself depicted solely as a male king, in the pharaoh's headdress, the pharaoh's shendyt kilt, and the pharaoh's false beard—without any female traits. Many of her statues, images, and texts seem part of a carefully calibrated media campaign to bolster the legitimacy of her reign as king—and rationalize her transgression. In reliefs at Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, she spun a fable of her accession as the fulfillment of a divine plan and declared that her father, Thutmose I, not only intended her to be king but also was able to attend her coronation. In the panels the great god Amun is shown appearing before Hatshepsut's mother disguised as Thutmose I. He commands Khnum, the ram-headed god of creation who models the clay of mankind on his potter's wheel: "Go, to fashion her better than all gods; shape for me, this my daughter, whom I have begotten."Unlike most contractors, Khnum gets right to work, replying: "Her form shall be more exalted than the gods, in her great dignity of King. …"On Khnum's potter's wheel, little Hatshepsut is depicted unmistakably as a boy.Exactly who was the intended audience for such propaganda is still disputed. It's hard to imagine Hatshepsut needed to shore up her legitimacy with powerful allies like the high priests of Amun or members of the elite such as Senenmut. Who, then, was she pitching her story to? The gods? The future? National Geographic?One answer may be found in Hatshepsut's references to the lapwing, a common Nile marsh bird known to ancient Egyptians as rekhyt. In hieroglyphic texts the word "rekhyt" is usually translated as "the common people." It occurs frequently in New Kingdom inscriptions, but a few years ago Kenneth Griffin, now at Swansea University in Wales, noticed that Hatshepsut made greater use of the phrase than other 18th-dynasty pharaohs. "Her inscriptions seemed to show a personal association with the rekhyt which at this stage is unrivaled," he says. Hatshepsut often spoke possessively of "my rekhyt" and asked for the approval of the rekhyt—as if the unusual ruler were a closet populist. When Hatshepsut's heart flutters this way and that as she wonders what "the people" will say, the people she may have had in mind were the ones as common as lapwings on the Nile, the rekhyt.After her death, around 1458 B.C., her stepson went on to secure his destiny as one of the great pharaohs in Egyptian his­tory. Thutmose III was a monument maker like his stepmother but also a warrior without peer, the so-called Napoleon of ancient Egypt. In a 19-year span he led 17 military campaigns in the Levant, including a victory against the Canaanites at Megiddo in present-day Israel that is still taught in military academies. He had a flock of wives, one of whom bore his successor, Amenhotep II. Thutmose III also found time to introduce the chicken to the Egyptian dinner table.In the latter part of his life, when other men might be content to reminisce about bygone adventures, Thutmose III appears to have taken up another pastime. He decided to methodically wipe his stepmother, the king, out of history.When Zahi Hawass set out to find Her Majesty King Hatshepsut, he was fairly certain of one thing: The naked mummy found resting on the floor of a minor tomb was not her. "When I started searching for Hatshepsut, I never thought I would discover that she was this mummy," Hawass says. For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had "huge pendulous breasts" of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse.Months earlier Hawass had visited Hatshepsut's tomb, KV20, to search for clues to her whereabouts. Wearing his trademark fedora, Hawass lowered himself 700 feet into one of the most dangerous tombs in the Valley of the Kings. The tunnel through friable shale and limestone reeked of bat droppings. When Howard Carter cleared it in 1903, he called it "one of the most irksome pieces of work I ever supervised." In the tomb Carter found two sarcophagi bearing Hatshepsut's name, some limestone wall panels, and a canopic chest, but no mummy.Carter made another discovery in a tomb close by—tomb KV60, a minor structure whose entrance was cut into the corridor entrance of KV19. In KV60 Carter found "two much denuded mummies of women and some mummified geese." One mummy was in a coffin, the other on the floor. Carter took the geese and closed the tomb. Three years later another archaeologist removed the mummy in the coffin to the Egyptian Museum. The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B.C.Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared. That changed in June 1989, when Donald Ryan, an Egyptologist and lecturer at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, came to explore several small, undecorated tombs in the valley. Prompted by the influential Egyptologist Elizabeth Thomas, who suspected that KV60 might house Hatshepsut's mummy, Ryan had included it on his application for a research permit. Arriving too late his first day to start work, Ryan decided to stroll around the site to drop off some tools. He wandered over to the entrance of KV19 and for the heck of it, thinking KV60 might be nearby, started sweeping the entranceway with his broom. He worked backward from the door of KV19. Within half an hour he'd found a crack in the rock corridor. A stone hatch revealed a set of stairs. A week later, with Beethoven's Pathétique Sonata playing on a tape deck, he and a local antiquities inspector entered the "lost" tomb.A craggy bay in the Western Desert embraces Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple. Behind its crowning ridge lies the great rift now known as the Valley of the Kings, the royal cemetery that holds the entrance to her tomb. Her father was likely the first pharaoh to prepare his final resting place in the valley, launching a tradition that would last for more than four centuries."It was spooky," he recalls. "I had never found a mummy before. The inspector and I walked in very carefully. There was a woman lying on the floor. Oh my gosh!"The mummy was lying in a tomb that had been trashed in ancient times by robbers. Her left arm was crooked across her chest in a burial pose some believe to be common to 18th-dynasty Egyptian queens. Ryan set about cataloging what he found. "We found the smashed-up face piece of a coffin and flecks of gold that had been scraped off," he recalls. "We didn't know how much had been moved around by Howard Carter, so we documented it as an intact site." In a side chamber Ryan found a huge pile of wrappings, a mummified cow's leg, and a stacked pile of "victual mummies," wrapped bundles of food laid up for the deceased's long journey through eternity.The more Ryan studied the mummy, the more he thought she might be someone important. "She was extraordinarily well mummified," he says. "And she was striking a royal pose. I thought, Why, she's a queen! Could it be Hatshepsut? Possibly. But there was nothing to link the mummy to any specific individual."Still, it didn't seem right to leave whoever she was lying naked on the floor in a mess of rags. Before he closed the tomb, Ryan and a colleague tidied the burial chamber up a bit. At a local carpenter's shop they had a simple coffin built. They lowered the unknown lady into her new bed and closed the lid. Hatshepsut's prolonged period of anonymity was nearing its end.Historians long cast Hatshepsut in the role of evil stepmother to the young Thutmose III. The evidence of her supposed cruelty was the payback she posthumously received when her stepson had her monuments attacked and her kingly name erased from public memorials. Indeed, Thutmose III did as thorough a job smiting the iconography of King Hatshepsut as he had whacking the Canaanites at Megiddo. At Karnak her image and cartouche, or name symbol, were chiseled off shrine walls; the texts on her obelisks were covered with stone (which had the unintended effect of keeping them in pristine condition).At Deir el Bahri, the site of her most spectacular architectural achievement, her statues were smashed and thrown into a pit in front of her mortuary temple. Known as Djeser Djeseru, holy of holies, on the west bank of the Nile across from modern Luxor, the temple is set against a bay of lion-colored cliffs that frame the tawny temple stones the way the nemes frames a pharaoh's face. With its three tiers, its porticoes, its spacious ramp-linked terraces, its now vanished sphinx-lined causeway and T-shaped papyrus pools and shade-casting myrrh trees, Djeser Djeseru is among the most glorious temples ever built. It was designed (perhaps by Senenmut) to be the center of Hatshepsut's cult.Images of her as queen were left undisturbed, but wherever she had proclaimed herself king, the workers of her stepson followed with their chisels, the vandalism careful and precise. "The destruction was not an emotional decision; it was a political decision," says Zbigniew Szafrań­ski, the director of the Polish archaeological mission to Egypt that has been working at Hatshepsut's mortuary temple since 1961.By the time excavators cleared the debris from the mostly buried temple in the late 1890s, the mystery of Hatshepsut had been refined: What kind of ruler was she? The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power. William C. Hayes, the curator of Egyptian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a principal at the Deir el Bahri excavations in the 1920s and '30s, wrote in 1953: "It was not long … before this vain, ambitious, and unscrupulous woman showed herself in her true colors."When archaeologists discovered evidence in the 1960s indicating that the banishment of King Hatshepsut had begun at least 20 years after her death, the soap opera of a hotheaded stepson wreaking vengeance on his unscrupulous stepmother fell apart. A more logical scenario was devised around the possibility that Thutmose III needed to reinforce the legitimacy of his son Amenhotep II's succession in the face of rival claims from other family members. And Hatshepsut, once disparaged for ruthless ambition, is now admired for her political skill."Nobody can know what she was like," says Catharine Roehrig, now a curator in the same department once headed by Hayes. "She ruled for 20 years because she was capable of making things work. I believe she was very canny and that she knew how to play one person off against the next—without murdering them or getting murdered herself."Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60. The thin mummy was retrieved from storage in the museum's attic; the fat one, KV60a, which had remained in the tomb where it had been found, was transported from the Valley of the Kings. Over a four-month period in late 2006 and early 2007, the mummies passed through a CT scanner that enabled the archaeologists to examine them in detail and to gauge their age and cause of death.The CT results from the four candidate mummies were inconclusive. Then Hawass had another idea. A wooden box engraved with Hatshepsut's cartouche had been found in a great cache of royal mummies at Deir el Bahri in 1881; it was believed to contain her liver. When the box was run through the scanner, the researchers were astonished to detect a tooth. The team dentist identified it as a secondary molar with part of its root missing. When Ashraf Selim, professor of radiology at Cairo University, reexamined the jaw images of the four mummies, there in the right upper jaw of the fat mummy from KV60 was a root with no tooth. "I measured the root in the mummy and the tooth, and we found that they both matched," Selim says.To be sure, the scientists have proved only that a tooth in a box belongs to a mummy. The identification is based on the assumption that the contents of the box are properly labeled and were once vital parts of the famous female pharaoh. And the box inscribed with Hatshepsut's cartouche is not the typical canopic vessel in which mummified organs are found. It's made of wood, not stone, and might have been used to hold jewelry or oils or small valuables."Some would say we have not found absolute proof," Selim says. "And I would agree."Visitors to the Temple of Amun at Karnak can see firsthand how images of Hatshepsut as a virile pharaoh were chiseled away years after her death. The likely culprit was her stepson, who may have hoped to keep her blood relatives from using the images to support their own claims to the throne.Still, Hawass asks, what are the odds that a box identified with Hatshepsut and found in a cache of royal mummies contains a tooth that exactly matches a hole in the smile of a mummy found next to the beloved nurse of Egypt's great female pharaoh? And how marvelous that the tooth was there to connect Hatshepsut's cartouche with a mummy. "If the embalmer hadn't picked it up and put it in with the liver, there is no way we would have known what happened to Hatshepsut," Hawass says.Already the CT scans have changed history, dispelling theories that Hatshepsut might have been killed by her stepson. She probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes. Hawass speculates that the high priests of Amun may have moved her body to the tomb of her nurse to protect it from looters; many royalty of the New Kingdom were hidden in secret tombs for security. As for the DNA tests, the first round began in April 2007 and has shown nothing definitive."With ancient specimens you never have a 100 percent match, because the genetic sequences aren't complete," says Angélique Corthals, a professor of biomedicine and forensic studies at Stony Brook University in New York and one of three consultants working with the Egyptians. "We looked at mitochondrial DNA for the suspected Hatshepsut mummy and her grandmother Ahmose Nefertari. There is about a 30 to 35 percent chance that the two samples are not related, but I cannot emphasize enough that these are just preliminary results." Another round of tests may soon deliver a clearer verdict.Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris. El Saddik came to the final item on the list: the mummified body of Hatshepsut herself. "You want us to remove the glass?" she asked incredulously, as if the mummy, long neglected, now possessed something unspeakably precious. The photographer nodded. The director shuddered. "This is the history of the world we're talking about!" she exclaimed.Hatshepsut’s obelisk, sculpted from a single block of granite, soars a hundred feet above the ruins of Karnak. Defying the attempts to erase her from history, it now stands magnificently as the tallest such monument in Egypt.In the end, it was decreed that one of the panels of glass could be removed from the case in the Royal Mummy Room without jeopardizing the history of the world. Staring at what was left of the great female pharaoh as the lights were being set up, I found myself wondering why it was so important to authenticate her corpse. On the one hand, what could better animate the astonishing history of ancient Egypt than the actual woman preserved in defiance of nature and the forces of decay? Here she was now, among us, like an ambassador of antiquity.On the other hand, what did we want from her? Wasn't there something oppressively morbid about the curiosity that brought millions of rubberneckers to the Royal Mummy Rooms and made a fetish of the royal dead in the first place? The longer I stared at Hatshepsut, the more I recoiled from those unfathomable eyes and the suffocating fixity of that lifeless flesh. Most of us live by the lapwing creed that is the antithesis of the pharaohs' faith: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. It struck me how much more of Hatshepsut was alive in her texts, where even after so many thousands of years, you can still feel the flutter of her heart.",
"Where, oh where is Cleopatra? She's everywhere, of course—her name immortalized by slot machines, board games, dry cleaners, exotic dancers, and even a Mediterranean pollution-monitoring project. She is orbiting the sun as the asteroid 216 Kleopatra. Her "bath rituals and decadent lifestyle" are credited with inspiring a perfume. Today the woman who ruled as the last pharaoh of Egypt and who is alleged to have tested toxic potions on prisoners is instead poisoning her subjects as the most popular brand of cigarettes in the Middle East.In the memorable phrase of critic Harold Bloom, she was the "world's first celebrity." If history is a stage, no actress was ever so versatile: royal daughter, royal mother, royal sister from a family that makes the Sopranos look like the Waltons. When not serving as a Rorschach test of male fixations, Cleopatra is an inexhaustible muse. To a recent best-selling biography add—from 1540 to 1905—five ballets, 45 operas, and 77 plays. She starred in at least seven films; an upcoming version will feature Angelina Jolie.Yet if she is everywhere, Cleopatra is also nowhere, obscured in what biographer Michael Grant called the "fog of fiction and vituperation which has surrounded her personality from her own lifetime onwards." Despite her reputed powers of seduction, there is no reliable depiction of her face. What images do exist are based on unflattering silhouettes on coins. There is an unrevealing 20-foot-tall relief on a temple at Dendera, and museums display a few marble busts, most of which may not even be of Cleopatra.Ancient historians praised her allure, not her looks. Certainly she possessed the ability to roil passions in two powerful Roman men: Julius Caesar, with whom she had one son; and Mark Antony, who would be her lover for more than a decade and the father of three more children. But her beauty, said Greek historian Plutarch, was not "the sort that would astound those who saw her; interaction with her was captivating, and her appearance, along with her persuasiveness in discussion and her character that accompanied every interchange, was stimulating. Pleasure also came with the tone of her voice, and her tongue was like a many-stringed instrument."People have been puzzling over the whereabouts of Cleopatra's tomb since she was last seen in her mausoleum in the legendary deathbed tableau, adorned with diadem and royal finery and reposed on what Plutarch described as a golden couch. After Caesar's assassination, his heir Octavian battled Antony for control of the Roman Empire for more than a decade; following Antony and Cleopatra's defeat at Actium, Octavian's forces entered Alexandria in the summer of 30 B.C. Cleopatra barricaded herself behind her mausoleum's massive doors, amid stores of gold, silver, pearls, art, and other treasures that she vowed to torch lest they fall into Roman hands.It was to the mausoleum that Antony, dying of self-inflicted sword wounds, was brought on the first of August so he might take a last sip of wine and perish in Cleopatra's arms. And it may have been in the mausoleum where, ten days or so after Antony's death, Cleopatra herself escaped the humiliation of defeat and captivity by committing suicide at the age of 39, reputedly with the venom of an asp. The Roman historian Dio Cassius reported that Cleopatra's body was embalmed as Antony's had been, and Plutarch noted that on the orders of Octavian, the last queen of Egypt was buried beside her defeated Roman consort. Sixteen centuries later Shakespeare proclaimed: "No grave upon the earth shall clip in it / a pair so famous."And yet we have no idea where that grave might be. The wealth of attention paid to Cleopatra by artists seems inversely proportional to the poverty of material generated about her by archaeologists. Alexandria and its environs attracted less attention than the more ancient sites along the Nile, such as the Pyramids at Giza or the monuments at Luxor. And no wonder: Earthquakes, tidal waves, rising seas, subsiding ground, civil conflicts, and the unsentimental recycling of building stones have destroyed the ancient quarter where for three centuries Cleopatra and her ancestors lived. Most of the glory that was ancient Alexandria now lies about 20 feet underwater.In the past few decades archaeologists have finally taken up the mystery of Cleopatra's whereabouts and are searching for her burial place in earnest. Underwater excavations begun in 1992 by French explorer Franck Goddio and his European Institute of Underwater Archaeology have allowed researchers to map out the drowned portions of ancient Alexandria, its piers and esplanades, the sunken ground once occupied by royal palaces. The barnacled discoveries brought to the sea's surface—massive stone sphinxes, giant limestone paving blocks, granite columns and capitals—whet the appetite for a better understanding of Cleopatra's world.Thesse statue parts—the head of a Roman woman and the body of one of Cleopatra’s ancestors— were uncovered during almost 20 years of excavations off the coast of Alexandria, Cleopatra’s capital. Much of the city and the area around it sank during centuries of earthquakes, tsunamis, and rising seas."My dream is to find a statue of Cleopatra—with a cartouche," says Goddio. So far, however, the underwater work has failed to yield a tomb. The only signs of Cleopatra the divers have encountered are the empty cigarette packs that bear her name, drifting in the water as they work.More recently, a desert temple outside Alexandria has become the focus of another search, one that asks whether a monarch of Cleopatra's calculation and foresight might have provided a tomb for herself in a place more spiritually significant than downtown Alexandria—some sacred spot where her mummified remains could rest undisturbed beside her beloved Antony.In November 2006 at his office in Cairo, Zahi Hawass, then secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, pulled out a sheet of Nile Hilton stationery. On it he had sketched the highlights of an archaeological site where he and a team of scientists and excavators had been digging over the previous year. "We are searching for the tomb of Cleopatra," he said, excitedly. "Never before has anyone systematically looked for the last queen of Egypt." This particular quest had begun when a woman from the Dominican Republic named Kathleen Martinez contacted Hawass in 2004 and came to share a theory she'd developed: that Cleopatra might be buried in a tumbledown temple near the coastal desert town of Taposiris Magna (present-day Abu Sir), 28 miles west of Alexandria.Located between the Mediterranean and Lake Mareotis, the ancient city of Taposiris Magna had been a prominent port town during Cleopatra's time. Its vineyards were famous for their wine. The geographer Strabo, who was in Egypt in 25 B.C., mentioned that Taposiris staged a great public festival, most likely in honor of the god Osiris. Nearby was a rocky seaside beach, he said, "where crowds of people in the prime of life assemble during every season of the year.""I thought before we started digging that Cleopatra would be buried facing the palace in Alexandria, in the royal tombs area," said Hawass. But in time, Martinez's reasoning persuaded him another theory might be worth exploring: that Cleopatra had been clever enough to make sure she and Antony were secretly buried where no one would disturb their eternal life together.A child prodigy who'd earned her law degree at the age of 19, Kathleen Martinez was teaching archaeology at the University of Santo Domingo, but it was an avocation; she'd never been to Egypt or handled a trowel. She traced her obsession with Cleopatra to an argument she'd had with her father in 1990, when she was 24 years old. She wandered into his library one day looking for a copy of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. Her father, Fausto Martínez, a professor and legal scholar normally quite careful in his judgments, disparaged the famous queen as a trollop. "How can you say that!" she protested. After an hours-long debate in which Kathleen argued that Roman propaganda and centuries of bias against women had distorted Cleopatra's character, Professor Martínez conceded that his opinion of Cleopatra might have been unfair.From that moment Martinez resolved to learn everything she could about the queen. She pored over the canonical texts, particularly Plutarch's account of Mark Antony's alliance with Cleopatra. It seemed clear that the Romans had been intent on depicting her (at worst) as a decadent and lustful despot and (at best) as a manipulative politician who'd played the bitter factions of the emerging Roman superpower against each other in a desperate bid to preserve Egypt's autonomy. It was also possible that modern-day researchers might have missed important clues about where Cleopatra was buried."You cannot find anything in any ancient writing about where Cleopatra is buried," Martinez said. "But I believe she prepared everything, from the way she lived to the way she died to the way she wanted to be found."In 2004 she emailed Hawass. She did not receive a reply. Unable to have herself smuggled into Hawass's office inside a sack—the famous stratagem by which the 21-year-old Cleopatra is supposed to have acquainted herself with Julius Caesar in 48 B.C.—Martinez assailed him with emails, upwards of a hundred by her estimate. Again, no reply. She headed for Cairo and eventually wangled an audience with Hawass through a guide who had worked for the Supreme Council of Antiquities."Who are you and what do you want?" Hawass asked when Martinez arrived in his office in the fall of 2004. She did not explain that she was searching for Cleopatra, worried that he would lump her in with the nuts who believe aliens built the pyramids. "I want to visit places that aren't open to the public," Martinez explained. Hawass granted her permission to visit sites in Alexandria, Giza, and Cairo.Martinez returned to Egypt in March 2005, calling on Hawass with the news that she had been appointed an ambassador of culture by the Dominican Republic. He laughed and said she was too young to be an ambassador. She told him she'd visited Taposiris Magna the previous year and wanted to go back. There were remnants of a Coptic church on the site, and Dominicans were interested in the history of Christianity. Hawass again said yes.After she had photographed and walked the site, she again called on Hawass. "You have two minutes," he said. The time had come to drop the veil. Martinez explained to him that she wanted to excavate at Taposiris. "I have a theory," she said, and finally confided that she thought Taposiris Magna was where Cleopatra was buried."What?" said Hawass, grabbing his chair. A group of Hungarian archaeologists had just concluded excavations at the site, and French archaeologists had excavated Roman baths just outside the walls of the temple. Plans were pending to turn Taposiris Magna into a tourist attraction."Give me two months," Martinez countered. "I will find her."Cleopatra VII was born in Egypt, but she was descended from a lineage of Greek kings and queens who had ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years. The Ptolemies of Macedonia are one of history's most flamboyant dynasties, famous not only for wealth and wisdom but also for bloody rivalries and the sort of "family values" that modern-day exponents of the phrase would surely disavow, seeing as they included incest and fratricide.The Ptolemies came to power after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, who in a caffeinated burst of activity beginning in 332 B.C. swept through Lower Egypt, displaced the hated Persian occupiers, and was hailed by the Egyptians as a divine liberator. He was recognized as pharaoh in the capital, Memphis. Along a strip of land between the Mediterranean and Lake Mareotis he laid out a blueprint for Alexandria, which would serve as Egypt's capital for nearly a thousand years.The top half of a granite colossus is hoisted to the surface of Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria. About 18 feet tall, the full sculpture represented Hapy, the god of the Nile’s yearly flooding, which fertilized Egypt’s fields. It likely stood outside the major temple in Herakleion. That long-lost city, now redis- covered underwater, was a center of trade and pilgrimage and a ritual site for Cleopatra and other Ptolemaic pharaohs.After Alexander's death in 323 B.C., Egypt was given to Ptolemy, one of his trusted generals, who, in a brilliant bit of marketing, hijacked the hearse bearing Alexander's body back to Greece and enshrined it in a tomb in Alexandria. Ptolemy was crowned pharaoh in 304 B.C.on the anniversary of Alexander's death. He made offerings to the Egyptian gods, took an Egyptian throne name, and portrayed himself in pharaonic garb.The dynasty's greatest legacy was Alexandria itself, with its hundred-foot-wide main avenue, its gleaming limestone colonnades, its harborside palaces and temples overseen by a towering lighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, on the island of Pharos. Alexandria soon became the largest, most sophisticated city on the planet. It was a teeming cosmopolitan mix of Egyptians, Greeks, Jews, Romans, Nubians, and other peoples. The best and brightest of the Mediterranean world came to study at the Mouseion, the world's first academy, and at the great Alexandria library.It was there, 18 centuries before the Copernican revolution, that Aristarchus posited a heliocentric solar system and Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth. Alexandria was where the Hebrew Bible was first translated into Greek and where the poet Sotades the Obscene discovered the limits of artistic freedom when he unwisely scribbled some scurrilous verse about Ptolemy II's incestuous marriage to his sister. He was deep-sixed in a lead-lined chest.The Ptolemies' talent for intrigue was exceeded only by their flair for pageantry. If descriptions of the first dynastic festival of the Ptolemies around 280 B.C. are accurate, the party would cost millions of dollars today. The parade was a phantasmagoria of music, incense, blizzards of doves, camels laden with cinnamon, elephants in golden slippers, bulls with gilded horns. Among the floats was a 15-foot Dionysus pouring a libation from a golden goblet.Treasures from the sunken ruins of the city of Canopus—pendants, beads, clasps, and other adornments—conjure up legends of Cleopatra’s lavish lifestyle. Such wealth helped motivate Rome’s conquest of Egypt, which brought access to the gold mines in Nubia and the caravans that delivered other luxuries. Canopus was notorious for wild celebrations, but it was also the site of a temple to Serapis, the Ptolemaic version of Osiris, god of the afterlife. This spiritual aspect continued into the Byzantine era, when Christian pilgrims may have offered up their valuables in thanks for cures.Where could they go from there but down? By the time Cleopatra VII ascended the throne in 51 B.C. at age 18, the Ptolemaic empire was crumbling. The lands of Cyprus, Cyrene (eastern Libya), and parts of Syria had been lost; Roman troops were soon to be garrisoned in Alexandria itself. Still, despite drought and famine and the eventual outbreak of civil war, Alexandria was a glittering city compared to provincial Rome. Cleopatra was intent on reviving her empire, not by thwarting the growing power of the Romans but by making herself useful to them, supplying them with ships and grain, and sealing her alliance with the Roman general Julius Caesar with a son, Caesarion.Lest her subjects resent her Roman overtures, Cleopatra embraced Egypt's traditions. She is said to have been the first Ptolemaic pharaoh to bother to learn the Egyptian language. While it was politic for foreign overlords to adopt local deities and appease the powerful religious class, the Ptolemies were genuinely intrigued by the Egyptian idea of an afterlife. Out of that fascination emerged a hybrid Greek and Egyptian religion that found its ultimate expression in the cult of Serapis—a Greek gloss on the Egyptian legend of Osiris and Isis.One of the foundational myths of Egyptian religion, the legend tells how Osiris, murdered by his brother Seth, was chopped into pieces and scattered all over Egypt. With power gained by tricking the sun god, Re, into revealing his secret name, Isis, wife and sister of Osiris, was able to resurrect her brother-husband long enough to conceive a son, Horus, who eventually avenged his father's death by slaughtering uncle Seth.By Cleopatra's time a cult around the goddess Isis had been spreading across the Mediterranean for hundreds of years. To fortify her position, and like other queens before her, Cleopatra sought to link her identity with the great Isis (and Mark Antony's with Osiris), and to be venerated as a goddess. She had herself depicted in portraits and statues as the universal mother divinity.Beginning in 37 B.C., Cleopatra began to realize her ambition to enlarge her empire when Antony restored several territories to Egypt and decreed Cleopatra's children their sovereigns. She appeared in the holy dress of Isis at a festival staged in Alexandria to celebrate Antony's victory over Armenia in 34 B.C., just four years before her suicide and the end of the Egyptian empire.It was Cleopatra's intense identification with Isis, and her royal role as the manifestation of the great goddess of motherhood, fertility, and magic, that ultimately led Kathleen Martinez to Taposiris Magna. Using Strabo's ancient descriptions of Egypt, Martinez sketched a map of candidate burial sites, zeroing in on 21 places associated with the legend of Isis and Osiris and visiting each one she could find."What brought me to the conclusion that Taposiris Magna was a possible place for Cleopatra's hidden tomb was the idea that her death was a ritual act of deep religious significance carried out in a very strict, spiritualized ceremony," Martinez says. "Cleopatra negotiated with Octavian to allow her to bury Mark Antony in Egypt. She wanted to be buried with him because she wanted to reenact the legend of Isis and Osiris. The true meaning of the cult of Osiris is that it grants immortality. After their deaths, the gods would allow Cleopatra to live with Antony in another form of existence, so they would have eternal life together."Slightly larger than life-size, a stone statue from Canopus in the third century B.C. wears a dress typical of Ptolemaic queens. Given the association of those women with Isis, the knot in the fabric is often called an Isis knot. For the Ptolemies, the relationship between Isis and her husband-brother, Osiris, was a model for royal marriages. Her cult endured for 500 years after the death of Cleopatra, one of her devoted followers.After studying more than a dozen temples, Martinez headed west of Alexandria along the coastal road to explore the ruin she had begun to believe was the last, best hope for her theory. The temple at Taposiris Magna had been dated to the reign of Ptolemy II, though it may have been even older. The suffix Osiris in its name implied the site was a sacred spot, one of at least 14 throughout Egypt where legend holds that the body of Osiris (or a dismembered part of it) had been buried.With the Mediterranean on her right and Lake Mareotis on the left, Martinez mused on the possibility that Cleopatra might have traveled a similar route, selecting this strategic location for her burial because it was inside the limits of ancient Alexandria and not yet under the control of the Romans during those last days before her death. "When I saw the place my heart beat very fast," she recalls. As she walked the site, she trailed her hands along the white and beige limestone blocks of the temple's enclosure. This is it! she thought. This is it!In 1935 British traveler Anthony de Cosson had called Taposiris Magna "the finest ancient monument left to us north of the Pyramids." What was surprising was how little work had been done at the site. In 1905 Evaristo Breccia, the renowned Italian archaeologist, had excavated the foundation of a small fourth-century A.D. Coptic basilica in the otherwise vacant courtyard of the enclosure and discovered an area of Roman baths. In 1998 a Hungarian team led by Győző Vörös found evidence of a colonnaded structure inside the enclosure that they concluded (incorrectly, as it turned out) had been an Isis temple.It was clear when Vörös's book, Taposiris Magna, was published in 2004 that the temple had had three incarnations—as a Ptolemaic sanctuary, a Roman fort, and a Coptic church. But was that the whole story? Zahi Hawass found himself pondering the possibility that a black granite bust of Isis that Vörös had coaxed from the dirt of Taposiris Magna might well be the face of Cleopatra herself. In October 2005 the dig got under way.Today it's easy to imagine that the view from the pylon of Taposiris Magna looks much like it did in Cleopatra's day—if you can block out the unsightly band of condominiums and resort hotels between the coastal highway and the broad white sand beach and glimmering blue expanse of the Mediterranean. One hot, sun-washed morning at the temple in May 2010, Kathleen Martinez was bundled in a long-sleeve shirt, head scarf, and fingerless woolen gloves. "For some reason I am always cold when I am here," she said. The two months of excavation she had requested had turned into three months, and three months had become five years.On the bedrock in the middle of the site an array of column fragments showed the ghostly outlines of what Hawass and Martinez have concluded was not a temple to Isis, but a temple to Osiris. It was oriented on the east-west axis. At an angle just north were the faint hints of an Isis chapel; to the south, an excavated rectangular pit: "That was the sacred lake," Martinez says.It's a cliché that you can stick a shovel in the ground almost anywhere in Egypt and find something amazing from the long-gone past. When Martinez and a team of excavators began probing the ground in 2005, she was focused less on the ultimate prize of Cleopatra's tomb than on simply finding sufficient evidence to sustain her theory that Taposiris Magna might be the place to look. She hoped to demonstrate that the temple was among the most sacred of its day, that it was dedicated to the worship of Osiris and Isis, and that tunnels had been dug underneath the enclosure walls. Within the first year, she was rewarded by the discovery of a shaft and several underground chambers and tunnels. "One of our biggest questions is why did they dig tunnels of this magnitude," she says. "It had to be for a very significant reason."During the 2006-07 season the Egyptian-Dominican team found three small foundation deposits in the northwest corner of the Osiris temple, just inches from where the Hungarian expedition had stopped digging. The deposits conclusively linked the Osiris temple to the reign of Ptolemy IV, who ruled a century and a half before Cleopatra. In 2007, further supporting the view that the site was very important to the Greeks of ancient Egypt, the excavators found a skeleton of a pregnant woman who had died in childbirth. The tiny bones of the unborn baby lay between the skeleton's hips. Her jaw was distended, suggesting her agony, and her right hand was clutching a small white marble bust of Alexander the Great. "She is a mystery," said Martinez, who had a coffin built for the remains of the mother.In six years Taposiris Magna has become one of Egypt's most active archaeology sites. More than a thousand objects have been recovered, 200 of them considered significant: pottery, coins, gold jewelry, the broken heads of statues (probably smashed by early Christians). An important discovery was a large cemetery outside the temple walls, suggesting that the subjects of a monarch wished to be buried near royal remains.Yet the tomb of Cleopatra still hovers out of reach, like a tantalizing mirage, and the theory of who is buried at Taposiris Magna still rests more on educated speculation than on facts. Might not Cleopatra's reign have unraveled too quickly for her to build such a secret tomb? A fantastic story, like a horse with wings, flies in the face of the principle of parsimony. But it's a long hard haul from not-yet-proved to disproved.Critics of Martinez's theory point out that it is rare in archaeology for someone to announce they are going to find something and then actually find it. "There is no evidence that Cleopatra tried to hide her grave, or would have wanted to," says Duane Roller, a respected Cleopatra scholar. "It would have been hard to hide it from Octavian, the very person who buried her. All the evidence is that she was buried with her ancestors. The material associated with her at Taposiris Magna is not meaningful because material associated with her can be found in many places in Egypt.""I agree that Octavian knew and authorized the place where she was buried," Martinez says. "But what I believe—and it is only a theory—is that after the mummification process was complete, the priests at Taposiris Magna buried the bodies of Cleopatra and Mark Antony in a different place without the approval of the Romans, a hidden place beneath the courtyard of the temple."If Cleopatra's tomb is ever found, the archaeological sensation would be rivaled only by Howard Carter's unearthing of the tomb of King Tut in 1922. But will finding her tomb, not to say her body itself, deepen our portrait of the last Egyptian pharaoh? On one hand, how could it not? In the last hundred years about the only new addition to the archaeological record is what scholars believe is a fragment of Cleopatra's handwriting: a scrap of papyrus granting a tax exemption to a Roman citizen in Egypt in 33 B.C.On the other hand, maybe finding her tomb would diminish what Shakespeare called "her infinite variety." Disembodied, at large in the realm of myth, more context than text, Cleopatra is free to be of different character to different times, which may be the very wellspring of her vitality. No other figure from antiquity seems so versatile in her ambiguities, so modern in her contradictions.It was lunch hour at the dig site, and the workers had gone to eat in the shade. We were sitting on top of the temple pylon in the radiance of noon, staring out at the sea beyond. There was a feeling of stillness in the air, an inkling of eternity, as if the old Egyptian gods were about—Re, who ruled over the earth, sky, and the underworld, and Isis, who saved Osiris by tricking Re into revealing his secret name.The search for Cleopatra has come at no small cost to Martinez. She gave up her thriving law practice in Santo Domingo and poured much of her savings into her quest. She moved to an apartment in Alexandria, where she has begun studying Arabic. But it's not an easy life, far from her family and friends. During the revolution earlier this year, she was confronted by a group of aggressive men as she worked at the excavation site. For now, work at the site is on hold. She hopes to return in the fall."I believe we are going to find what we are looking for," she says. "The difference is now we're digging in the ground, not in books."",
"For thousands of years, women have ruled in remote villages and reigned over major empires. Here, a Mongolian princess poses for a portrait in full court dress in the 1920s.Modern queens and princesses, ruling from the highlands of the Tibetan Plateau to the tiny South Pacific island of Niue, have rarely possessed the type of power wielded by the female leaders of ancient Egypt.These women were not just figureheads or puppet-masters behind a man, they were powerful and ruthless heads of a highly advanced civilization. In ancient Egypt women enjoyed the sort of human rights that their counterparts today are still fighting for—they worked, owned property, ran businesses, and divorced their husbands. Their society was, writes Kara Cooney, a professor of Egyptology at UCLA, in her new book When Women Ruled the World, "light-years ahead of us in their trust of female power.""In one place on our planet thousands of years ago, against all the odds of the male-dominated system in which they lived, women ruled repeatedly with formal, unadulterated power," Cooney writes in the book's introduction. No other civilization was so regularly run by women, particularly in times of war, which leads her to ask: "What about ancient Egypt allowed this kind of political and ideological power among the acknowledged weaker sex, plagued by pregnancy, nursing, monthly hormonal shifts, and menopause?"Cooney seeks answers in profiles of six ancient female leaders—Merneith, Neferusobek, Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Tawosret, and Cleopatra—beginning near the dawn of the empire in 3000 B.C. All ruled as queens and all but one ended up in the official role of king. But their reign wasn't as liberated as it seems: though they were given ultimate power, they often served in the place of a male leader who was too young or old to rule, and wielding this power still threw them into battle with the patriarchy. Soon after their rule, most of these female leaders had their accomplishments wiped from history, their statues smashed, and their names forgotten. But for brief moments, they ruled Egypt, and a glance at the current world stage shows that remains unique. "Simply put," Cooney writes. "modern female leaders are far more distrusted than their counterparts were in the ancient Egyptian world."",
"Ramses II enjoyed one of the longest reigns in Egyptian history. He spent more than 65 years on the throne during a period of military and cultural splendor which would win him the title Ramses the Great.In 1249 B.C. Ramses II had been ruling for 30 years. To commemorate such a notable occasion, pharaohs held jubilee celebrations known as Heb Sed. Ramses chose his magnificent new capital city, Pi-Ramses, to stage a suitably lavish celebration for this milestone.Nothing, for the moment, imperiled the prosperity and security of Egypt, especially the Hittites to the north, whose empire spread over modern-day Turkey and northern Syria. Ramses II had defeated them in 1275 B.C. at the Battle of Kadesh. Ramses presented his win as a crushing victory over the Hittites. He had 60-foot-tall statues of himself carved out of the sandstone in Lower Nubia near the Nile at Abu Simbel. Scenes of the battle adorn the halls of these astonishing funerary temples, exemplifying Ramses’ dual role as builder and public relations expert. Historians now know, by comparing Hittite and Egyptian accounts of the battle, that the outcome of Kadesh was probably less one-sided than Ramses’ depiction.1279 B.C. Son of Seti I, a great builder and warrior, Prince Ramses succeeds his father and becomes Pharaoh, taking the name Ramses II.1275 B.C. Egyptian and Hittite forces clash at the Battle of Kadesh. Ramses almost loses both the battle and his life, but presents it as a victory.Circa 1264 B.C. Construction begins on the great funerary temples of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia to commemorate the Battle of Kadesh.1258 B.C. Ramses and the Hittite king Hattusilis III sign a peace treaty that brings their rivalry to control modern-day Syria and Israel to an end.1249 B.C. After ruling for 30 years, Ramses II celebrates his first royal jubilee at Pi-Ramses, his magnificent capital on the Nile River Delta.1245 B.C. Ramses marries Hattusilis III’s daughter. The princess takes the Egyptian name Maathorneferure.1213 B.C. Ramses II dies after more than 60 years on the throne. He is succeeded by his 13th son, Merneptah.In 1258 B.C., partly as a result of that battle, the Hittite king, Hattusilis III, agreed to sign a treaty to bring the long hostilities between the two empires to an end, ushering in one of ancient Egypt’s most creative and prosperous periods. Nine years later, around the time of his 30-year jubilee, Ramses and the Hittites decided to work for a closer, political alliance by proposing a marriage between the pharaoh and a Hittite princess. And not just any princess: Envoys sent from the Egyptian capital, Pi-Ramses, made it clear the pharaoh had his eye on no one other than King Hattusilis’s firstborn daughter.The two courts embarked on lengthy negotiations, whose twists and turns historians have interpreted from the clay tablets preserved in the archives of the Hittite capital, Hattusha, in the central region of modern Turkey. Discovered by archaeologists in 1906-08, the tablets have provided a wealth of detail on the day-to-day diplomacy between these two ancient empires and the intricate details involved in planning a royal union.In the second millennium B.C. rulers did not usually meet one another as they do at modern summits. Diplomacy was conducted through people referred to by the Akkadian term mar shipri. These civil servants were both messengers and ambassadors at the same time, and many had royal or aristocratic blood. They bore expensive gifts, and were received with pomp and ceremony.Written in cuneiform, the ancient writing was formed by pressing a wedge-shaped tool into wet clay. The Hittite tablets reveal how the pharaoh’s emissaries convinced the king to send Ramses II a formal marriage proposal. On the Hittite side, the arrangements were mainly conducted by Hattusilis’s consort, Queen Puduhepa, who focused on her daughter’s dowry.When Ramses’ envoys complained about the delay in the new bride’s arrival, as well as the pithy size of the dowry promised by the Hittites, Puduhepa wrote to blame it on shortages and a fire that had ravaged the royal storehouses. The queen also reproached the pharaoh—whom she addressed as a “brother”—for his greed. “Does my brother have no possessions? ... But brother, you are getting rich at my expense! That is unbecoming of a great lord's renown and dignity.”Nevertheless, she told him he would be satisfied: “The dowry will be more beautiful than the King of Babylon’s ... I will send my daughter this year; servants, cattle, sheep and horses will go with her.” A subsequent letter said the princess would take “magnificent tribute in the form of gold, silver, bronze, slaves, teams of horses, cattle, goats and thousands of sheep as gifts for the pharaoh.”The main demand on the Hittite side was that the princess should hold the rank of principal wife. She was not to be a mere secondary spouse, in the same category as other Near Eastern princesses who had joined the pharaoh’s harem. Making the princess his principal wife was the only concession Ramses was willing to make.The account of the Hittite princess’s journey to Pi-Ramses was engraved on a large stela in the Great Temple at Abu Simbel. The Marriage Stela opens by exalting the pharaoh, portraying the Hittites as a subordinate power: “Thou commandest them ... forever and ever, together with the whole land of Kheta [the Hittites]. While thou shinest upon the throne of Re, every land is under [thy] feet, forever.” The stela then recounts the journey undertaken by the princess and her retinue: “Then they [came] with [their] possessions, and [their] splendid [gifts] before them, of silver and gold ... The great chiefs of every land came; they were bowed down, turning back in fear, when they saw [his majesty].”Any suggestion that he might send Hattusilis an Egyptian princess in return was unthinkable. Pharaohs had entered into arranged marriages with foreign princesses for more than a century. Ramses himself had five non-Egyptian wives and his predecessor had seven. But the pharaohs never allowed their own daughters to go abroad. It was their way of demonstrating that, for all the military power of the Hittites, an Egyptian pharaoh enjoyed the higher status, in spite of the pretense of treating one another as equals in their letters. When Kadashman-Enlil I, a Babylonian king, dared ask for the hand of an Egyptian princess, the reply was blunt. Ramses II merely reminded him that “since time immemorial no daughter of the King of Egypt has ever been given [in marriage].”Having left Hattusha, Hattusilis’s daughter and her entourage headed south through modern-day Turkey to Adana, a city near the Mediterranean coast. From there, they proceeded through the Kingdom of Kizzuwatna to Aleppo in modern-day Syria, and finally to Kadesh, where the Egyptians and Hittites fought the famous battle years before. It was here, on the border of the Egyptian territories, that Queen Puduhepa bid farewell forever to her daughter. All that is known about the rest of the journey is what the Marriage Stela relates: The Hittite princess entered Egypt’s capital, Pi-Ramses, in the third month of the winter-spring season (peret) in the 34th year of Ramses’ reign: February of the year 1245 B.C.In a letter to Ramses, Hattusilis wrote that the bride was ready for her journey, so the pharaoh’s emissaries could set off to meet her at the border between the empires. “May they come and anoint my daughter’s head with fine oil and take her to the home of the Great King, the King of the land of Egypt, my brother!”This is the only marriage ritual mentioned in the correspondence. It was widespread practice in the Near East, and raised the woman to a higher rank when she was engaged to be married. When he found out the young woman was on her way, Ramses was jubilant. “The Sun God, the Storm God, the Gods of Egypt and the Gods of the Land of the Hittites have decreed that our two great countries be united forever,” he wrote.Few details about the bride have been recorded. The Hittite princess’s identity is only recorded with her adopted Egyptian name, Maathorneferure. She traveled to Egypt accompanied by a vast retinue—a common practice in the dynastic marriages of the time. Just over a century before, a princess from the Mitannian empire in what is today northern Syria, had arrived at Amenhotep III’s court with more than 3,300 ladies-in-waiting. These huge entourages acted as an ancient diplomatic service that could return valuable information back to their home countries. No wonder, then, that in one of her letters Queen Puduhepa insisted that those who were accompanying her daughter would be afforded full protection on arrival.Puduhepa also took care to arrange security for the journey. The Hittite company may have been crossing vassal states, but they would never have been completely safe from attacks by bandits and nomads. Long remembered was an attack on a traveling Hittite prince a century earlier. He was killed en route to Egypt, more than likely by a faction from the Egyptian court that was opposed to his marriage to an Egyptian queen—possibly Tutankhamun’s widow, Ankhesenamun, or perhaps even Akhenaten’s widow, Nefertiti.Puduhepa told Ramses that the princess would be escorted by Hittite troops, and that she would accompany her some of the way. King Hattusilis himself did not go with his daughter, because to have been seen in the retinue could have been interpreted as paying homage to a superior ruler.Ramses, however, always the expert propagandist, simply ignored this absence when he documented the wedding. On the Marriage Stela in Ramses’ temple of Abu Simbel, the Hittite king is shown alongside his daughter, both figures submissively approaching and honoring the pharaoh.According to correspondence from the period of Akhenaten, roughly a century before Ramses II’s jubilee, the quickest route from the Hittite capital to Egypt, took around a month and a half. However, the princess’s party took from three to six months to complete the trip.“They have traversed many mountains and difficult ways, that they might reach the boundaries of his majesty,” recount the hieroglyphs of the Marriage Stela. The carved image shows Ramses awaiting her arrival, surrounded by the gods Ptah—one of the main state deities—and Seth, god of warfare and storms, for whom Ramses II’s father, Seti I, was named.The festivities to celebrate the new queen’s arrival probably took place at Pi-Ramses, where the pharaoh’s jubilee had been held four years before. Her new name, Maathorneferure—meaning “Neferure, she who sees Horus”—was tied to a belief system that, despite some similarities, would have seemed very different to what she knew in her native Hattusha. Her fate, from that point on, became tied to that of Egypt and Egyptian culture. When the wedding finally took place, in 1245 B.C., she did become Ramses’ Great Royal Wife, as the previous queen, Isis-Nofret, had died after succeeding Queen Nefertari ten years earlier.What became of the bride? Little about her life after marriage is known. She is not thought to have had any sons, although she probably bore a daughter. There is an inscription that proves that at one time Maathorneferure was living in the Gurob harem to the south of El Faiyum, which may mean that she lost her status as principal wife. In any case, a second Hittite princess later arrived to become Ramses’ wife, suggesting that Maathorneferure died and a second marriage took place to renew the alliance between the two great powers of the ancient world.Teshub, the Hittite version of Seth, on a basalt relief from the ninth century B.C.Egyptian and Hittite culture did have certain features in common. Teshub, the Hittite god of storms, was equivalent to the Egyptian divinity, Seth, who played a key role in the wedding preparations. The Marriage Stela records how Ramses II called on Seth to grant favorable weather for his bride-to-be’s long journey south.",
"Today's ubiquitous passport requirements only became a formalized standard in the wake of World War I.A passport is a doorway to the world—at least for those who, based on the arbitrariness of place of birth, possess one deemed “powerful” enough to grant the freedom to travel it with relative ease. But the evolution of the passport hasn't been a straight path, and the document we recognize today is still fairly new. Although the earliest reference to a passport-like document dates to 450 B.C., and Henry V of England began granting travel documents to his subjects in the 15th century, it wasn't until the early 20th century that passport design was standardized and the palm-sized booklet really took shape. Here are some of the oddest passport facts.There's no known record of anything like a passport existing in ancient Egypt. But in 1974, when the mummy of Ramses II (died 1213 B.C.) had to be flown to Paris for restoration, it was issued a valid Egyptian passport, including a photo of the pharaoh's ancient face. His occupation was listed as “King (deceased).” (Learn more about the passport’s contentious history.)Had there been passports during Ramses’ six-decade rule, he likely wouldn’t have needed one, anyway: Living monarchs do not generally require passports. The U.K. Royal Family's official website explains that “as a British passport is issued in the name of Her Majesty, it is unnecessary for The Queen to possess one.” Indeed, a message inside a U.K. passport’s cover requests that the bearer be allowed to pass freely “in the Name of Her Majesty.” Basically, the Queen is a passport.Similarly, in Japan, it was decided that it would be “inappropriate” to issue the Emperor a Japanese passport, which bears the imperial seal of the Chrysanthemum Throne on its cover and contains “a foreign minister’s request to allow the holder to travel without trouble.” Though when Emperor Akihito abdicates next spring, he will, like the rest of the Imperial family, need one for future international travels.While international borders are very much a human construct, an ancient mummy is not the oddest entity to have required a passport. The peregrine falcon's name may mean “wanderer” but in the United Arab Emirates, they can’t go wandering far without a passport. Falcons—specifically saker and peregrine falcons—are highly prized in the U.A.E., where falconry is a significant part of the region’s Bedouin heritage. Once essential for hunting, the sport continues to be a source of national pride.Unfortunately with the falcon’s high status (and monetary value) comes the risk of smuggling, so falcons in the Emirates get their own green, U.A.E.-issued passports for jetting around the world to falconry festivals and competitions. Each passport has its own identification number corresponding to the number inscribed on the falcon’s leg ring and, just like those of humans, it must “be endorsed by the appropriate border control officer who should validate it with an ink stamp, signature and date to show the history of movement from State to State.”Teddy the domestic short hair cat has a passport for travel to France. European Union Pet Passports allow quarantine-free travel between member countries.Animal passports are more common than you might expect. While pets in the United States can get paperwork permitting them to cross borders with minimum hassle, European Union pets actually get their own blue booklets, complete with a photo inside the cover. E.U. Pet Passports allow quarantine-free travel between member countries, a scheme so beloved that, in October, hundreds of dogs (and their owners) took to the streets of London in a wooferendum, protesting the threat posed by Brexit to their prized passports.British horses, on the other hand, require horse passports even if they never venture farther than their field—the policy is meant to ensure that horses treated with drugs harmful to humans do not get sent for slaughter and enter the food chain.In the U.S., some (human) travelers may soon also require passports even if they don’t leave the country. The 2005 Real ID Act requires that state ID must be compliant with increased security requirements if the holder is to be allowed to board domestic flights. While most states have complied, some have needed an extension. California and Massachusetts, for example, have only until January 10, 2019 to issue the new IDs, otherwise residents will need to show a passport to board a domestic flight.Fortunately, the number of Americans owning passports has greatly increased in recent years, a phenomenon often attributed to the 2007 law change regarding visiting Mexico and Canada—the previously porous U.S./Canada border is now so restricted that you’ll need a passport just to cross the street in one town—as well as a trend toward investing in experiences over material objects. An indication, perhaps, that this small document is set to become an ever-more important part of our daily lives.",
"Immigrants crowd the deck of the S.S. Patricia circa 1906, a time when there was no worldwide standard for passports.In black and white photos and crackly films shot through with static, a classic image of the United States at the turn of the last century emerges: a near constant rush of immigrants, most destined to pass through Ellis Island. There they were given a cursory disease check, questioned, and in most cases, allowed to proceed on their journeys inward. This was easy enough to do without a global standard for identifying documents. Now, as immigration policy takes center stage worldwide, it’s hard to imagine just how they got through without them.With their microchips and holograms, biometric photos and barcodes, today’s passports can seem like stunning feats of modern technology, especially when considering their origins can be traced back to the biblical era. Centuries ago, the sauf conduit or safe conduct pass was designed to grant an enemy “passage in and out of a kingdom for the purpose of his negotiations,” explains historian Martin Lloyd in The Passport: The History of Man’s Most Travelled Document. This was little more than written plea that acted as a type of gentleman’s agreement: that two rulers recognized each other’s authority, and stepping over a border would not cause a war.Of course, it’s not too easy to enforce the rules when there’s no agreement on them. This all changed in 1920, when the idea of a worldwide passport standard emerged in the aftermath of the First World War, championed by the League of Nations, a body tasked with the heavy burden of maintaining peace. A year later, perhaps recognizing a political opportunity, the U.S. passed the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and later, the Immigration Act of 1924 limiting the inflow of immigrants. The emergency? Too many newcomers from countries deemed a threat to “the ideal of American hegemony.” How to identify an immigrant’s country of origin? By a newly minted passport, of course.The children of detained and waiting immigrants wave American flags on a rooftop garden at Ellis Island circa 1900.Cooked up by a Western-centric organization trying to get a handle on a post-war world, the passport was almost destined to be an object of freedom for the advantaged, and a burden for others. “A passport is a kind of shield: when you're a citizen of a wealthy democracy,” explains Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, author of The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen. A Canadian-born Swiss citizen of Iranian parentage, Abrahamian puzzles over the construct of citizenship, “I don't have a particularly strong emotional attachment to any of my passports; I see them as accidents of birth and I wouldn't identify as any nationality if I didn't have to.”Like Abrahamian, critics of the 1920 resolution argued it was less about creating a more democratic society of world travelers than it was about control, even within a country’s own borders. In the early 20th century, married American women were literally a footnote in their husbands’ passports, reports Atlas Obscura. They were unable to cross a border alone, though married men were of course free to roam.An immigrant family carries their bags through Ellis Island circa 1905.Some nations foresaw the darker implications of the passport and spoke out against what they saw as Western dominance, Mark Salter explains in Rights of Passage: The Passport in International Relations. “Although many countries wished to dispose of the passport, because a few countries would not give up the passport—in fact, no country could afford to give up the passport.” This catch 22—along with a heavy dose of angst—would make sly, quiet appearances in 20th-century travel literature, including works by Paul Bowles and Joan Didion. No one, it seemed, much liked the idea of being labeled, packaged, and dehumanized within a passport’s pages, but no one could get around without one.In recent years, passports have faced a distinctly 21st-century identity crisis, becoming a highly sought after commodity, like real estate and fine art. In addition to a black market of stolen and fake passports, some countries have willingly opened up their borders to the highest bidder. “When I discovered [during my research] that there was a whole legal market for passports, it validated my feeling that citizenship was a pretty arbitrary thing,” Abrahamian notes. For example, countries like Malta and Cyprus essentially sell citizenship—the former for over $1 million, the latter for significant investments.Beyond the one percent, a shifting global landscape of new states, changing borders, and discriminatory ethnic policies has further reinforced statelessness: those who do not belong to a nationality of any country. At least 10 million people around the world are stateless, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These people are often denied passports, and consequently, freedom of movement. These extremes again illustrate how murky our notions of citizenship really are.Today, U.S. State Department statistics report 18.6 million passports issued in 2016–the highest annual number on record. The popular online search tool Passport Index offers up ways of comparing passports via interactive tools reminiscent of fantasy football scoreboards. Magazines like Travel & Leisure breathlessly announce the winners of “best” and “worst” passport rankings every year. As other nations join the new U.S. administration in toying with the idea of closed borders, it is worth meditating once again on the passport’s essential arbitrariness.Depending on our country of origin, a passport may grant us extreme privilege or extreme distress. It may be a sheltering sky or a burden to bear. The passport isn’t going anywhere, but the carefully thought-out precautions meant to shape it over a period of decades into a near-perfect document must now evolve as our world changes. So what will it look like next?",
"The blue light of dawn reveals the shadowed contours of the Arabian desert as Sheikh Butti bin Maktoum bin Juma al Maktoum and his son kneel in prayer. The velvet sand is cool, and the tracks from the night wanderings of a desert fox crisscross the area. Nearby, the silhouettes of 12 small pillars mark the foot of a dune, at the top of which a man is setting up a folding table to serve tea. On the horizon it’s possible to see the shimmer of the Dubai skyline, a place transformed from a tiny backwater into a hypermodern port city by the sheikh’s uncle, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum.There, a cascade of concerns and obligations awaits Sheikh Butti—corporate board decisions, real estate deals, royal family matters, requests for counsel from across the Middle East, Europe, and beyond. But all of that is a world away. Here in the silent landscape of his ancient Bedouin forebears, the sheikh finds peace with his falcons.It is October, and falconers in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) are busy training their birds for hunting and the upcoming racing season. Each day Sheikh Butti (pronounced BOO-tee), his son Maktoum, and their retinue rise at four in the morning and drive more than an hour into the desert to train their birds before the scorching heat of the day.As the sky brightens, I see that the 12 pillars are hooded falcons on perches, silently awaiting the day’s training. There are chocolate and cream peregrines, white speckled gyrfalcons, dusky brown sakers, and hybrids of different species. Together the group contains lineages that cut across Europe, Asia, and the wilds of the Arctic. They represent only a few of the hundreds of birds the sheikh owns, which arguably compose one of the most exquisite collections of falcons ever assembled. (Considering that falcons have been zealously collected throughout history by Assyrian rulers, Viking chiefs, Russian tsars, Mongol khans, and practically every English monarch from Alfred the Great to George III, this is indeed quite a claim. More about this history later.)National Geographic is partnering with the National Audubon Society, BirdLife International, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to celebrate the centennial of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Watch for more stories, books, and events throughout the year.Pani, one of the sheikh’s aides, hands me a cup of tea and hustles to prepare the lure for the first trainee. “Good morning, Howard,” the sheikh calls out to the lanky, bald man in glasses standing next to me. Howard Waller, 57, is his falcon breeder, friend, and confidant. The sheikh’s voice is bright and full of enthusiasm, and the two men immediately spiral into a spirited, hopscotching discussion of falcon esoterica.They discuss the birds arrayed before them and others in the sheikh’s several aviaries. They comment on the merits of quail and pigeon diets, the proper way to build muscle mass, the nuances of diseases such as aspergillosis and bumblefoot. They note the young birds that exhibit aggressive personalities and those that seem passive. They sprinkle in bits of gossip about acquisitions by other Dubai falconers and news from falconry communities in neighboring Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain. Almost like a long-married couple, they eagerly anticipate each other’s answers and communicate using a shorthand inscrutable to nearly everyone else: “The gray whose father was the one we hunted with two years ago.” “The gyr with the broken tail feather that we fixed.”They speak of favorite birds: Delua, White Finger, Old Bedford, and of course, the late Hasheem—dear Hasheem—and the lineages they produced, each with its own genetic bundle of surprising color schemes and personality traits. And then there is the White One. Their voices vibrate with excitement when they mention the White One, a yearling that may be the most beautiful falcon either has ever seen.It’s been this way each morning for the nearly two weeks the sheikh has graciously allowed photographer Brent Stirton and me to observe the training sessions. Before the first rays of sun creased the horizon, the two falconers would wander off into the dark desert, just the two of them, lost in conversation.Over the past 20 years, Sheikh Butti and Howard have helped pioneer important changes in Arab falconry. Most notably, they breed and hand raise every bird they fly—a practice that was thought impossible before captive peregrine falcons were first successfully bred in 1942 by Nazi leader Hermann Göring’s falconer, Renz Waller (no relation to Howard). It’s also a practice Howard and Sheikh Butti believe can have a major impact on falcon conservation at a time when several species are facing threats from habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade. And though the vast majority of U.A.E. falconers now fly captive-bred birds, some traditional falconers in other parts of the Middle East still prefer wild birds captured after they’ve learned to catch prey on their own.As soon as the sun becomes a soft orange ball on the horizon, the chitchat abruptly ends and the training begins in earnest. Maktoum, 27, wearing a heavy leather glove, gently takes one of the hooded falcons, a young peregrine, from its perch, gets into a Toyota four-by-four, and drives a few hundred yards away. Sheikh Butti holds what looks like a fishing pole with a rope tied to the tip and a quail wing tied to the end of the rope. He begins waving the pole, making wide, sweeping arcs with the fluttering wing.In the distance Maktoum slips the leather hood off the falcon’s head and releases it. The bird beats its large, powerful wings and climbs high into the crisp air, immediately spots the lure, and flies toward it, its head following the arcs of the swinging wing. Sheikh Butti calls to it: “Hah!” The falcon swiftly gains altitude, banks hard, and dives on the lure, but at the last second, the sheikh jerks the wing away. “Hah!” calls the sheikh. The falcon seesaws awkwardly as it regroups. It passes overhead, and I can hear the soft whistle of its wings paddling the air. Its eyes—eight times as sharp as a human’s—are fixed like laser sights on the lure. It gains altitude and dives. The sheikh again pulls the lure at the last second.Finally, on the third try, Sheikh Butti allows the bird to catch the wing and take it down onto the powdery sand. Pani quickly substitutes the lure for a quail breast, and the falcon begins stripping off the fresh meat. The sheikh gives explicit instructions for exactly how much to let the bird eat. Too much and the peregrine will get fat and slow; too little and it won’t gain muscle.“That’s a young male,” Howard says. “It’s still figuring out how to hunt. The key is to not let it get frustrated. You want to make sure you let it catch the lure before it gives up.”The sheikh and his son put each of the falcons through its paces. The older birds make the young male look amateurish by comparison. Maktoum takes them farther into the desert, releasing some from nearly a mile away. They rise effortlessly, as if impervious to gravity. Their flight paths are much more efficient and strategic, their wings flattening, flaring, cupping the air to twist and plunge in pursuit of the spinning lure. Like fighter pilots, some approach with the rising sun at their backs, using the glare to blind the “prey.” Others fly barely off the ground, approaching from behind the parked Toyotas, using them to block the prey’s field of vision before a final flash of speed.Delua, a gray gyr (pronounced jer), even uses Brent as cover. Hunched on his knees in the sand, Brent is photographing Sheikh Butti when the falcon whips over his shoulder, a wing tip grazing his hair as she strikes the lure.Sheikh Butti laughs. “They will knock you down,” he says. “It’s happened to me several times.”It’s a visceral example of why falcons are such deadly hunters. In the wild, the gyr can surpass 60 miles an hour flying straight ahead. A diving peregrine can exceed 240 miles an hour, making it the fastest creature on the planet. At such velocities, even a bird weighing only a few pounds can deliver a violent blow.“Like a lightning bolt with feathers,” Howard says.Historians aren’t sure when humans first began capturing and training birds of prey to hunt animals they couldn’t kill with arrows or catch with snares. References in the ancient poem The Epic of Gilgamesh suggest that falconry existed in what is now Iraq as early as 4,000 years ago. Over centuries, the practice of catching and training falcons proliferated in cultures throughout the known world. King Tut was buried wearing a falcon pendant. The Greeks struck coins depicting Zeus with a falcon. One of the earliest Japanese falconers, a woman, wrote a treatise on the subject. Norse merchants traded gyrfalcons from Iceland throughout Europe, and the economy of the Dutch city Valkenswaard depended almost exclusively on the trade of falcons.By the time Marco Polo encountered Kublai Khan in the 13th century, the Mongol ruler employed 60 managers to oversee 10,000 falconers. Meanwhile, in Europe, the Holy Roman Emperor, King Frederick II, spent 30 years personally compiling an exhaustive scientific study of falconry that even now is regarded among the most authoritative tomes on the history and techniques of the sport.But no region has a stronger claim to the practice than Arabia, where today more than half the world’s falconers reside. While falconry (which also includes hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey) was largely the sport of kings in Europe, it was a critical tool for survival in the Arabian Desert.Bedouins would catch migrating falcons and train them to hunt game, such as houbara bustards and desert hares. Before the arrival of guns, the birds greatly increased the Bedouins’ ability to provide food for their families, and in the harsh desert environment, every ounce of protein was crucial. Falconry was so important to Arab culture by the advent of Islam that the Prophet Muhammad specifically mentions it in the Quran, declaring food caught by falcons to be clean for Muslims to eat.But in the 20th century the rapid development of Dubai and the other emirates almost wiped out the practice in the U.A.E. The houbara declined precipitously as humans encroached on its habitat, and hunting the large bird eventually was banned. Only the wealthy could afford to keep falcons and travel abroad to hunt houbara in Central Asia and North Africa.Then in the early 2000s, Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum introduced falcon racing as a way to make falconry accessible to the average Emirati. The birds are timed as they chase a lure over a specified distance. The season, which lasts from December through January, is highlighted by the President’s Cup, a competition in which more than 2,000 falcons compete for nearly seven million dollars in prize money.The impact of racing is evident all over Dubai, where falcon ownership has skyrocketed. Perches can be found in hotel lobbies and office buildings throughout the city. Falconers bring ailing birds to a falcon hospital and shop for their needs at a mall dedicated to the sport.One afternoon, Howard and I visit the falcon mall. Swarms of customers, many carrying hooded birds on their gloved fists, peruse the offerings of vendors selling everything from falcon food (frozen pigeons and quail) and falcon vitamins to tiny transmitters for tracking lost birds and hand-dyed leather hoods from Spain and Morocco. There is even a store specializing in radio-controlled model airplanes painted to look like houbaras for young falcons to learn to chase.The mall also has its own falcon clinic, where I meet a young man in a traditional long white dishdasha with a peregrine on his arm, his two young sons trailing behind him. “Is the falcon sick?” I ask. “No, he is getting a checkup,” the man says. “He is going to race!” one of the boys says. “He is going to win!” says his brother. The man beams proudly.Howard and I walk over to a section of the mall where dealers sell live falcons, and Howard moves slowly among the perches, inspecting the hooded birds. There are peregrines and sakers, the traditional favorites of Saudi falconers, and a few tiny striped kestrels: starter birds. He asks the proprietors where the birds come from, and each vendor points to papers bearing official stamps showing the bird’s country of origin.Howard nods in approval. “It’s a lot better now,” he says. He strokes the falcons’ breast feathers and inspects their feet. “These birds seem pretty healthy, not too stressed. I used to see a lot of birds in bad shape that had been smuggled in from Pakistan or from Russia, through Syria,” he says. “But the government has cracked down on that. Now each bird that comes in or out of the U.A.E. must have its own passport.”The U.A.E.’s efforts notwithstanding, falcon smuggling remains a concern in many parts of the world. Conservationists report that saker and peregrine falcons are trapped during their migrations through Pakistan and smuggled to wealthy buyers in the Middle East. Gyrs from the Arctic regions of Russia are also poached. Of those species only the saker is currently listed as threatened or endangered, though there are reports that some populations of gyrs appear to be decreasing in parts of the wild. Conservationists are worried that the illegal trade, combined with shrinking falcon habitat—especially in the Arctic because of climate change—could imperil the birds’ long-term survival.These concerns, Howard says, are a major reason Sheikh Butti is so committed to breeding falcons, an operation he recently expanded in Scotland. “You should come visit,” Howard says.Howard is in a hurry because it’s feeding time and he’s got some 200 hungry falcons waiting for him. It’s late May, nearing the end of the breeding season, and we’re driving to Sheikh Butti’s falcon farm, situated among the verdant hills and rugged moors of coastal Scotland. As he navigates the narrow roads, Howard describes how as a boy in Rhodesia, he’d devoured every book about birds that he could get his hands on, and later after immigrating to South Africa, he had begun taking in raptors that had been injured or orphaned—peregrines, lanners, black eagles, African merlins, tiny little sparrow hawks (“fierce little songbird hunters”), even an owl (“the dumbest bird I ever worked with”). Over time he became a dedicated falconer.It was on a trip to Dubai in 1998 when a friend introduced him to Sheikh Butti, who was intrigued that Howard thought he could breed and train falcons in the U.A.E. “All the veterinarians I talked to said it was impossible to breed falcons in the desert, let alone teach [captive-bred birds] to hunt there,” Howard says. A few other falconers in the U.A.E. were also attempting to breed but with limited success, and the sheikh and Howard set out to prove the experts wrong. During their first breeding season, they hatched more than 20 saker eggs and raised 15 to maturity. The next year they doubled the number.As word of their success spread, local falconers began sending them cast-off birds—falcons deemed untrainable or those with diseases such as severe bumblefoot (a potentially fatal infection in the feet) or hopelessly mangled flight feathers. Howard refused to give up on any bird. He figured out their individual personalities one by one, carefully superglued broken wing feathers, and patiently treated the bumblefoot. (“Most falconers don’t understand it’s really about stress,” he says.) Several of the donated falcons became skilled hunters and joined the sheikh’s breeding population.A few years ago, the sheikh and Howard decided to expand their operation with a second facility in Scotland, closer to the native climates of peregrines and gyrs, and near other high-quality falcon breeders with whom they could exchange genetic lines. The sheikh keeps several of the new birds each year to train for hunting and others to breed, gives some to family and friends, and sells the rest to other falconers.We reach Howard’s house, which sits on a rise with a view of the North Sea on the far horizon. The hungry falcons are waiting, and the air echoes with their piercing screeches. We head to a small complex of buildings behind the house and enter one that holds a walk-in freezer filled with locally sourced quail and pigeon. Howard gathers a generous bucketful of breasts, and we visit dozens of rooms containing breeding pairs of peregrines and gyrs, each with a clutch of two or three nestlings. Howard puts the meat on a small shelf, and we watch the males fly over, pick up the meat, and take it to the females. The pair then take turns feeding the squawking nestlings.Howard also breeds hybrids—part peregrine, part gyr—created by collecting sperm from the males and artificially inseminating females. “Gyrs are highly intelligent birds, much smarter than peregrines,” Howard says. “They can have diva personalities, but when you combine them with peregrines, you get a large, strong hunting bird that is easier to handle and more resistant to disease.”In one of the rooms I spot a gyr the color of pure snow, without a speckle of brown or gray. It is the precious White One. For millennia, historians have expounded on the obsession with pure white gyrs. Ransoms for kidnapped nobles, overtures of international diplomacy, dowries for royal marriages have hinged on the special birds. During the Crusades, Sultan Saladin of Egypt and Syria refused the enormous sum of a thousand gold ducats from King Philip of France to return his pure white gyr, which had flown across the battle lines.Birds of the Photo Ark, with photos by Joel Sartore and text by Noah Strycker, is available at shopng.com/books.It’s not just the bird’s beauty that excites Howard and Sheikh Butti. The White One is proving to be a fearless, aggressive hunter. “She’s not just a show falcon,” Howard says. “It’s everything you dream about in a bird.”I’ve seen news reports of wealthy sheikhs buying super falcons such as this for as much as $250,000, and I ask Howard how much the White One could sell for. “The media reports crazy prices,” he says, but few are accurate. “Those stories help fuel the black market,” he adds, incentivizing people to trap wild falcons. You might find a wealthy Middle Eastern falconer willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for the White One, he allows, but Sheikh Butti would never sell her. To him and to Howard, the White One represents much more than just a trophy. She was born from the line of gyrs that stretches back to one of the lost-cause, problem falcons Howard was given in the late 1990s. She offers living proof that wild falcons aren’t better than those bred in captivity. The sheikh’s consistent success over the years hunting with his captive-bred falcons has prompted other royal falconers to seek out captive-bred birds. Some have invested in their own breeding programs. This marks an important trend, reasons Howard, one that has helped dampen the market for smuggled wild falcons.Ultimately, Howard and the sheikh hope to release captive-bred gyrs into the wild to bolster their numbers in some parts of the Arctic that have seen a decline. It’s a practice that actually saved peregrines. By 1970, because of the widespread use of the pesticide DDT, the peregrine falcon had all but disappeared in the United States. Tom Cade, an ornithologist and falconer, founded the Peregrine Fund and recruited falconers from across North America to help save the species. Their efforts included releasing 6,000 captive-bred falcons. Today the peregrine population is considered robust. “Eventually, we’d like to release into the wild most of the birds we breed,” Howard says.After the feeding, Howard takes me to a building that holds imprints, or falcons he’s hatched from artificially inseminated eggs and is raising by hand. Over time, an imprint will recognize the person who feeds it as its parent. The room is filled with dozens of plastic crates holding imprints, some only days old, their pink flesh covered with wisps of down. Others are fat little fuzz balls insistently chirping at him to feed them. He takes a bowl of freshly ground pigeon and quail meat, hands me long steel tweezers, and shows me how to gently fill their gullets with the meat.Once all the mouths are fed, we move to the incubator room. The walls are lined with elaborate charts tracking in punctilious detail the genetic lines and development of every falcon bred this season. Nearby, the season’s last dozen brown speckled gyr eggs sit under the warmth of infrared heat bulbs. Every day Howard and his wife, Victoria, use a special light to illuminate each egg and measure the chick’s development inside—a sort of falcon sonogram.He picks up one egg that seems ready to hatch. There is a minuscule nick in the shell where the chick has tried to break through. “Sometimes they’re too weak. Breaking the shell is part of nature’s test for weeding out the weak ones,” Howard says.He lightly taps the egg and holds it to my ear. Faintly, I hear “Cheep, cheep.” It is soft but unmistakable, like a feeble radio signal from another world. Howard, always a champion for the weak ones, gently begins peeling open the shell, and in seconds he’s holding a baby falcon. He dabs away the sticky yolk. The bird is mostly wet pink flesh and matted silver down. It struggles to lift its head, which seems far too big for its tiny body. It’s nearly impossible to imagine this helpless creature one day gliding across the sky like an overlord. Finally, the chick manages to open one globelike eye, and the newest gyrfalcon on the planet looks up at Howard Waller, its new father.“Cheep,” it says.",
"To reach the butterfly artist’s house, you have to navigate a maze of mud-brick homes near the wide, brown Oubangui River. Four years ago Muslim rebels and Christian militias rampaged through, fighting for control of Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. Today the neighborhood is filled with squealing children playing soccer and chattering vendors hawking peanuts and eggs, avocados and mangoes, wild honey and peppercorns. But violence still plagues the city, and the people here remain keenly alert to the sounds of gunshots and military helicopters.Philippe Andé is oblivious to all of that. A slight, balding man, he hunches over a worktable covered in butterfly wings—a constellation of electric colors, flamboyant shapes, and exotic patterns. The Central African Republic is home to 597 identified species, and it’s common to suddenly find yourself amid a cloud of the silent, fluttering creatures, as though you’d wandered into a flurry of confetti. Andé, a farmer, catches them in his fields and sends boys to collect them in the hills and along the river.With tweezers, a razor blade, and rubber cement, he painstakingly arranges the tissue-thin wings into radiant scenes of Central African life, each a miniature stained glass window. A man catches a speckled green fish in a swirling turquoise river. Women in orange dresses with sleeping babies tied to their backs pound cassavas into flour. A boy climbs a tree to harvest coconuts. There are fields filled with cotton; portraits of elephants, gorillas, parrots, antelope; even a faceted diamond, the country’s most famous export.This is the Central African Republic that Andé chooses to see when he closes his eyes: the time before 2013, the year the Seleka—an alliance of predominantly Muslim rebel groups—looted, raped, killed, and burned its way across the country; toppled the corrupt Christian-dominated government; and ignited a brutal, still smoldering civil war that has killed thousands, displaced nearly a million others, and created food shortages.To be honest, Andé’s enchanting pictures represent some of my own idealized impressions of the Central African Republic. The country caught my attention when I saw it highlighted on a conservation map, an island of green roughly the size of France containing some of Africa’s last pristine wilderness. I learned that vast stretches of its forests remain uninhabited and teem with wildlife. Beneath this bounty lies a wealth of resources, including diamonds, gold, uranium, and possibly oil. It seemed reasonable that such a sparsely populated country—only five million people, compared with France’s 65 million—would thrive. But it was failing. Why? That question has plagued me over the past three years as I’ve reported on what Central Africans refer to as the Crisis, their term for the war and the chaos that has followed.On my first trip to Bangui, I put the question to a French Army officer as we sat on an Air France flight about to take off from Paris. It can be a touchy subject for the French, who colonized the country during the European rush for Africa in the 19th century. The Central African Republic gained independence in 1960, but the French have remained deeply involved in its affairs. Today Central Africans rely on Total, a French company, for much of their gasoline, and the currency the nation uses is backed by the French treasury.The officer, a broad-shouldered man in his 40s, was embarking on his second peacekeeping tour. “Logistics are a big problem,” he said, shaking his head. “It’s a big, landlocked country, and the roads are shit.” He described how during the rainy season, from May to October, villages in the marshy northeast are entirely cut off, shutting down important trade routes. “The economy in the north can’t grow, and the people there are angry,” he said. “That is where the Seleka was born.”At that point we were interrupted by the screaming of a Central African woman who was being deported. She’d been escorted onto the plane by two policemen and handcuffed to her seat. She strained against the handcuffs, yelling hysterically. The other passengers were a mixture of Central Africans returning to their country, peacekeepers, aid workers, and diplomats.The woman’s words unsettled the Central Africans. “She is a sorceress,” complained one man. “She is cursing the plane,” said another. The flight attendants tried to calm the passengers, but soon several were trying to pull their bags from the overhead bins and demanding to get off. After an hour’s delay the pilot ordered the police to remove the woman. He announced that because of the delay we would have to lay over that night in Cameroon. “We cannot land in Bangui at night,” he explained, “because the airport lights do not work.” The officer leaned over and said, “It is also because it is not safe to travel the road from the airport to the city at night.” He grinned ruefully. “This is how things work in the Central African Republic.”On one of my first days in Bangui, a local guide drove me to a small plaza with six gold-painted statues. An exuberant man in a brightly colored dashiki, he explained that the plaza illustrated all the history I needed to know. The plaza honors the six men who led the country from its independence movement to the start of the Crisis. The statues were chipped, and goats nibbled weeds growing in cracks in the pavement nearby. “This is Barthélémy Boganda,” he began at the first statue, as if he were a professor holding class. “He is to Central Africans what George Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr., are to Americans.”From my reading I knew the story of Boganda, the self-described son of a cannibal, who famously negotiated with Charles de Gaulle for the country’s independence. But I didn’t interrupt my guide. He seemed comforted to talk about the one leader nearly every Central African regards as a saint. In conversations with dozens of Christians and Muslims, I never once heard Jesus or Muhammad invoked, but Boganda was cited often. He was born into what was then the French colony of Oubangui-Chari, named for the rivers that defined its southern and northern borders. Private companies ran the colony with impunity, and any notion of justice was left to its administrators. On Bastille Day, 1903, a French official in Kaga Bandoro allowed his men to execute an African prisoner by inserting a stick of dynamite into his anus and igniting it. “It is a bit stupid, but it will dumbfound the natives,” the official explained. “After this they will probably keep quiet.”Boganda’s life reads like that of an Old Testament prophet. Just before his birth in 1910, French forces killed his father during a raid on his village. Company guards clubbed his mother to death when she refused to collect wild rubber. The orphaned Boganda was taken in by a Roman Catholic priest, and he would go on to take his own vows, becoming Oubangui-Chari’s first native priest. He later served as its first native representative in the French National Assembly, becoming an outspoken critic of French rule. When independence was imminent, Boganda was the people’s clear choice to be their leader.He dubbed the nation the Central African Republic, designed its flag, and wrote the country’s motto: “Equality for Everyone.” But on March 29, 1959, just before the first elections, a plane carrying Boganda exploded in midair. Today people throughout the country believe that the French were behind his death, despite France’s denials. The incident has colored the relationship between the countries ever since.“We were their colony, and they didn’t want to let us go,” the guide, a forest ranger by trade, said. “You can quote this, but please don’t use my name. The French still think we are their colony.” He pointed to the statues of the other five men, who had all served as president. “When each one of these guys decided to go against the French, he was replaced by the next guy.”But the leaders who followed Boganda have their own sins to answer for, he said. Walking down the line of statues, he pointed an accusatory finger at the stern visage of each man, as if he were speaking directly to him. He described how they squandered the nation’s wealth, played favorites among the country’s numerous ethnic groups, and stirred deep resentment among the 15 percent of the population that is Muslim (the rest practice Christianity or animist beliefs). He stopped at the last statue, the man whom many Central Africans accuse of starting the Crisis, François Bozizé, an army officer who seized power in 2003. “He promised the Muslims he would include them in his government, if they would help him take power. Then he betrayed them, and that’s how the Seleka came together,” the guide said.Seleka fighters achieved their goal of dislodging Bozizé but had little idea how to govern. They controlled Bangui for less than a year before the United Nations sent in a peacekeeping force. The Seleka withdrew to Muslim-dominated regions, and the alliance soon fractured. The disparate rebel groups split their territory into fiefdoms, each controlled by a former Seleka leader who has tapped into local resources to raise money to pay fighters and buy weapons. During the past year they’ve begun attacking each other, prompting 70,000 people to flee their homes.Photographer Marcus Bleasdale and I wanted to explore how these resources, which hold such promise for the nation, have become the lifeblood for the forces that keep it divided. We decided to visit Bambari, a town in the center of the country and the biggest in the territory controlled by former Seleka leaders.It takes a day to get there from Bangui by 4x4 along a route that cuts through thick forest and passes several villages the Seleka brutalized on its path to the capital. When the UN peacekeepers are patrolling, the road is generally safe. Other times bandits lie in wait. Some are former fighters from the Seleka, or from the Anti-Balaka, militias formed by Christians and animists to fight the Seleka, but it’s hard to tell. The nation is awash in desperate people and weapons. Kalashnikovs of varying makes and vintages are sold on the black market, but bandits are just as likely to brandish crude shotguns made from stolen water pipes.Much of the road is unpaved and pitted with deep ruts that require drivers to slow almost to a walking pace, offering opportunities to stage ambushes or, as we discovered, to sell things. As our driver navigated a particularly rough stretch, a man emerged from the forest waving two large turtles. He walked next to the vehicle calling out prices, slowly reducing them as we pulled away. Later another man held up a freshly butchered antelope shank. Then some giggling boys presented two strings of still wriggling fish. When we paused to look at the fish, a girl dashed out carrying bottles filled with wild honey.The man Marcus and I wanted to meet in Bambari was Ali Darassa, a former Seleka general who controls the town. Black husks of burned homes are all that remain of its largest Christian neighborhood, and tens of thousands of Christians now live in a tent camp on the edge of town. The market district run by Muslim traders is still open but does a fraction of the business it did before the Crisis, when Christians frequented its shops, butcheries, and teahouses.Darassa’s fighters roar around in pickup trucks with mounted machine guns, brazenly ignoring the UN peacekeepers, who seem to do little more than flirt with young women. His fighters collect a $50 tax on every head of the hundreds of cows bound for Bangui markets each week. They also demand protection money from shop owners, collect tolls from vehicles, and tax the area’s coffee trade. But the crown jewel in Darassa’s portfolio is a gold mine about 40 miles away.I tried several times to interview Darassa, and his men always made excuses. But they said he didn’t have a problem with our visiting the gold mine, which is how, one morning, Marcus and I came to stand on the edge of a deep, terraced gorge that had been dug by a small army of men.One of the foremen, a fireplug of a man in his early 30s with hands as hard as anvils, told me he’d been working at the mine since it opened three years ago. Before the Crisis, a Canadian company had begun prospecting at the site, but when the violence erupted, it left, along with dozens of other foreign companies that had been exploring for oil, harvesting timber, working on roads and dams. Very few have returned.The gold is extracted from gravel found at the bottom of the mine, he explained. Some 300 lithe, muscled men and boys were organized in vertical lines stretching up terraced steps to the rim. I watched as the men at the bottom shoveled dirt over their shoulders to the men on the terrace above them. They in turn shoveled it up to the next level and so on, like an escalator of dirt. The men, singing, shouting, and scraping, tended to fall into a rhythm. Choof, thump, choof, thump, choof, thump. I watched several men pass a cigarette up their line, each taking a puff before returning to his labors.Each man, the foreman explained, earns about nine dollars a day. Some of Darassa’s fighters, shouldering Kalashnikovs, wandered by. The foreman stopped talking, but when they moved on, he estimated that the mine generates some four million dollars a year. He said Darassa collects 6 percent of the gold “for security.”We spent several hours at the mine and shantytown built to house the men. There were restaurants selling grilled beef, boiled cassava, and Mocaf beer from Bangui; a cinema showing Vin Diesel and Sylvester Stallone DVDs; and shops selling toothbrushes, soap, and knockoff European soccer jerseys. The foreman told me all the storekeepers take gold as payment. We watched as women and children helped the men sieve the gravel. “There,” said a young man, smiling broadly and pointing to a tiny fleck. “That is gold.”As a foreigner I was often approached by people who wanted to tell me about things that have happened during the Crisis. The first time, a man came to my hotel in Bangui and asked to speak to the American. “I want to tell you what happened to my nephew,” he told me.We took a motorbike to his house, where I met Paul Koli-Miki. He told me that two days before, he had been abducted by Seleka supporters while working near a Muslim neighborhood called PK5. They beat him with a hammer and used a pair of pliers to rip out three of his teeth. His voice was still muffled by the bloody cotton pressed into his gums, and his eyes were wide with shock. He had filed a complaint with a city tribunal in Bangui. “I don’t know if I will receive justice,” he said.That is a lament thousands of Central Africans could make. The Crisis has shattered what was left of the decrepit court system and the public’s shaky confidence in the rule of law. There are police and some functioning courts—I once got a traffic ticket in Bangui for not wearing my seat belt—but for the most part they are ill prepared to deal with serious crimes, which raises the question: Can the country recover if justice is never served?Given this void, people have turned to foreigners to register their grievances. A rawboned Muslim man wearing a knitted skullcap once approached me at a mosque in the western town of Berbérati. Thick glasses magnified his pale blue eyes, and his fingers had a slight tremor as he reached out and took my hand as if to hold me in place. “The Anti-Balaka killed all my cows. They cut down my fruit trees. And they killed my son.” His voice caught, and he gripped my hand. “I am 76 years old. What can I do? What can you do?” He started weeping.Among the most troubling of these encounters occurred when I met a girl who said she had been sexually abused by a French peacekeeper. The girl’s mother explained that when the Seleka moved closer to her Bangui neighborhood, she fled with her daughter to the airport, which was protected by French troops. “The French soldiers were so kind to us,” the mother said. “[They] shared their food and water bottles with us.”The girl listened quietly as her mother spoke. She was about five feet tall and had recently turned 17. Her hair was pulled back in neat cornrows. She kept her eyes on the floor as she described in a timid voice how she met a tall French soldier with a mustache when she passed by his checkpoint, a small sandbag enclosure. “He gave me cookies and sweets,” she said. He started saying things in French she didn’t understand, so he used sign language to show he meant sexual intercourse and pulled out his penis. She took a deep breath, and her voice grew even softer. “The man showed me some food. He said, ‘If you cry, I will beat you. If you don’t cry, I will give you food every day.’ So I agreed to have intercourse.”She said she had sex with the soldier one other time, and he gave her some rice. Now she was five months pregnant. Her mother sent her to live with a relative to avoid the shame of facing their neighbors. “There are many other girls like her who also got food for sex from the French but have never told this story.” There was an investigation, she noted, “but there has been no result.” In January French judges decided not to bring charges against soldiers accused of sexually abusing children in the Central African Republic.In a vacant lot in Bangui, a slender man in a polo shirt plays soccer with a gaggle of energetic boys. He moves with a powerful grace. The ball seems to follow his feet as if he has trained it to obey him. He’s trying to teach the boys a fundamental play called give-and-go. He demonstrates, delivering a crisp pass to a boy and then moving fluidly to receive it back. The lesson runs counter to how the boys play street ball, shooting every time they touch the ball. They listen intently, almost reverently, because the man speaking to them is a national hero. Ibrahim Bohari, who is known to everyone as I. B. (pronounced ee-bay), is the former captain of the national soccer team. Next to the memory of Boganda, the Wild Beasts may be the country’s most unifying force. Its roster includes Muslim and Christian players, and it’s one of the few institutions in which no one cares about a person’s religion or ethnicity.I. B., who is Muslim, went on to play for professional teams in Belgium and Turkey, and with the Crisis erupting, he chose to move back home. “I couldn’t hear about what was happening and not do something,” he told me.He returned to Bangui to find his fellow Muslims had been chased from his neighborhood. But when he encountered Anti-Balaka fighters, they welcomed him. “I asked them why they didn’t attack me. They said, ‘We can never kill you, I. B. We love you.’ ” He shakes his head at the absurdity.He set about trying to find ways to help heal his country and one day noticed some boys playing soccer with a ball made of rags. He learned they all had Christian parents who had been killed or had fled. In the evenings they would line up by the bakeries downtown and ask for day-old bread and then go sleep under the mango trees on the road to the presidential palace.I. B. teamed up with So.Sui.Ben, a Swiss charity, and rented a compound to house a dozen of the youngest boys. Twice a week, after the boys finish their school lessons, he leads them in practice. He’s outfitted them in bright yellow uniforms, including socks and cleats, precious luxuries in a country where nearly all kids play barefoot.But the orphanage isn’t I. B.’s most ambitious project. He’s been organizing “peace matches,” soccer games between teams he assembles by mixing former Christian and Muslim fighters in some of Bangui’s tensest neighborhoods.“We have to focus on the young men,” I. B. tells me, noting that part of the problem is that so many have no jobs and their heads are filled with films and music that celebrate violence. “When someone tells them to join a rebel group, they think they can live out this fantasy.”The matches require weeks of preparation and delicate diplomacy—persuading religious authorities to endorse them, recruiting participants, arranging security with UN peacekeepers, and soliciting donations from businesses. “It’s not just about the game,” I. B. says. “It’s also about showing the community a picture of Muslims and Christians getting along and working together.”Some in Bangui are skeptical. “A soccer match can’t bring back the dead,” one imam said. “It won’t create jobs. It won’t change people’s hearts.”Before leaving the country, I attend a peace match at a primary school in PK5, the Muslim neighborhood where Paul Koli-Miki had his teeth ripped out. A crowd of Christians and Muslims gathers in the stands. The atmosphere is festive. Young women in colorful sundresses hand out sodas. A jovial announcer describes the action and cracks jokes, substituting the players’ names with those of European superstars. “Messi takes the ball from Ronaldo and passes to Zidane,” he barks into the microphone. People are laughing, the sun is shining, and the young men race and jostle and sweat. It’s not the beautiful teamwork that I. B. teaches, but I see him on the sidelines, smiling and cheering. Everyone is cheering.It is a beautiful, if fragile moment, like a picture made out of butterfly wings.",
"Poachers killed this black rhinocerous for its horn with high-caliber bullets at a water hole in South Africa’s Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park. They entered the park illegally, likely from a nearby village, and are thought to have used a silenced hunting rifle. Black rhinos number only about 5,000 today.This story appears in the October 2016 issue of National Geographic magazine.It was a five-hour drive from South Africa’s Kruger National Park, home of the world’s largest wild rhinoceros population, to Polokwane, home of the world’s most wanted man when it comes to rhino horn trafficking: a millionaire safari operator and ex-policeman named Dawie Groenewald.To meet Groenewald, photographer Brent Stirton and I sped in two cars through gorgeous, winding mountain ranges. But then night fell, and in the darkness outside the city someone had poured tar down the center line of the highway and set it ablaze. It appeared to be another protest rooted in the racial and economic tensions that continue to flare in South Africa more than two decades after the end of apartheid. We wove around the fire only to come upon a traffic jam and a makeshift roadblock a mile later. In the middle of the road what looked like a sofa was on fire, the flames shooting 10 feet into the air. Large rocks blocked all four lanes. Brent got out of his car and moved rocks too big to drive over, while I watched for an ambush. We picked our way through the gantlet as unseen people hurled stones from beyond the shoulder.We stayed the night at a dank roadside hotel, then waited, in accordance with Groenewald’s instructions, at a gas station for his man, Leon van der Merwe, to meet us. We followed him for 20 minutes along an expanse of immaculately fenced property until we reached two stone pillars with a gate that slid open electronically. Standing in the driveway, hands on his hips, was Dawie Groenewald.Mozambican authorities say these men confessed to intending to poach a rhino in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. They will be charged under a new wildlife conservation law and, if convicted, face a maximum prison sentence of 12 years.A two-man security team deploys by helicopter at sunset for antipoaching duties on Hume’s rhino ranch. Hume reckons he spends $330,000 a month to operate the ranch, $200,000 of which goes to keeping his rhinos safe. He has joined a lawsuit to lift South Africa’s ban on rhino horn trading.Today Groenewald, who has been called the “butcher of Prachtig” for what he allegedly did to rhinos on his hunting property of that name (prachtig is Dutch for “beautiful”), and 10 co-defendants face 1,872 counts in a South African indictment. The “Groenewald Gang,” as South Africa’s press has dubbed them, are charged variously with illegally killing rhinos, illegally dehorning rhinos, trading in rhino horn, racketeering, money laundering, and related crimes. In the United States, Groenewald and his brother, Janneman, have been indicted for tricking nearly a dozen American hunting clients into illegally killing rhinos at Prachtig, and U.S. authorities have requested their extradition. In the Czech Republic investigators linked Groenewald to a rhino horn–trafficking syndicate after discovering that horns shipped to Vietnam came from rhinos shot by Czech hunters at Prachtig. Groenewald denies knowing the purpose of these hunts. He was once banned from hunting in Zimbabwe and has been expelled from the Professional Hunters’ Association of South Africa.This is the story of Dawie Groenewald, an accused rhino horn trafficker, and John Hume, the owner of the world’s largest rhino farm—two men who know each other well and share a common goal: to end the South African and international bans on trading and selling rhino horn. Groenewald has agreed to see Brent and me at a time when he is in a high-stakes legal battle that could land him in prison for decades or create an opening for the legal sale of rhino horn in South Africa—an opening that could help pave the way to a legal global trade, which opponents say could doom rhinos.South Africa is home to nearly 70 percent of the 29,500 rhinos left on Earth, down from several hundred thousand in Africa before the 1800s, when the European imprint on the land intensified. They’re spread across two continents and five species: the white rhino, with some 20,400 remaining; the black, with 5,250; the greater one-horned; the Sumatran; and the Javan. According to South Africa’s Private Rhino Owners Association, 6,200 of the country’s rhinos are in private hands and are used commercially for photographic safaris, legal hunting, horn production, and breeding.A security team member (displaying his “antipoaching unit” tattoo) holds a rhino’s horn at the ranch of John Hume—the world’s top rhino farmer—in Klerksdorp, South Africa. The horns of Hume’s 1,300 rhinos are trimmed every 20 months or so and grow back. He stores them in hopes of a legalized trade, which he says will reduce poaching, a claim many conservationists reject.The horn of a rhinoceros is the world’s most valuable appendage in an exotic marketplace that values nature’s oddities, such as elephant ivory, tiger penis, and giraffe tail. Unlike the horns of many species, including cattle, rhino horn is not made of bone. It is made of keratin, a protein also found in our hair and fingernails, and if you trim a rhino’s horn, it grows back. Although selling rhino horn is illegal, in South Africa if you have a permit, you can cut off a rhino’s horn. Every year or two South African rhino farmers tranquilize their animals with darts, cut as much as four pounds of horn from each rhino, and store it all in bank vaults and other secure locations, hoping for a day when it’s legal to sell horn.Meanwhile a booming illegal trade supplies mostly Vietnam and China, where rhino horn is often ground to a powder and ingested as a treatment for everything from cancer to sea snake bites and hangovers. Inspired by years of erroneous reporting by Western media, people have recently also been using rhino horn as an aphrodisiac. On the black market in South Africa, the horn of the white rhino sells for up to $3,000 a pound, according to Groenewald, but on Asian black markets it wholesales for five to 10 times that, and retail prices can go up astronomically from there. A single bull rhino carrying 22 pounds of horn might buy a new life for a Mozambican poacher who slips over the border into Kruger National Park with an AK-47, but that poacher himself is likely to be exploited by the men who supplied his weapon. That poacher also may be shot by authorities, as were 500 Mozambican poachers in Kruger from 2010 to 2015.Rhino poaching has reached disastrous proportions during the past decade. In 2007 South Africa reported losing just 13 rhinos. In 2008 it was 83. Last year it was 1,175. In Kruger, home to some 9,000 rhinos, poachers kill on average two to three every day. The killing isn’t limited to Africa. In April poachers shot a greater one-horned rhino with AK-47s in India’s Kaziranga National Park hours after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had visited the park to promote conservation. Rhinos don’t roar when they’re injured. They keen. A shot mother will cry in pain, sometimes inadvertently causing her frightened baby to return to her. Poachers will sever a baby’s spine with a machete to save a bullet, then take its horn too.For those on the front line, protecting rhinos is no longer a conservation challenge: “It’s a war,” says Xolani Nicholus Funda, chief ranger at Kruger, where most of the world’s rhino poaching takes place. “That’s our frustration. The rhino war—it’s like drugs. It involves lots of cash and bribery. The whole justice system is really a frustration. We’re losing cases” in court. “We’re surrounded by police stations we don’t even recognize as police stations because they’re working with the poachers.”In 1977 the international trade in rhino horn was banned by parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the treaty governing the global wildlife trade. But the ban applies only to trade between countries, and it has an exception that horn traffickers have turned to their advantage: Under CITES it is legal to export the horn—or trophy—from a white rhino shot with a permit on a sport hunt. Beginning in 2003 Vietnamese rhino horn traffickers began signing up with South African hunting outfitters to kill rhinos for their horns, and later a Laos-based syndicate even hired prostitutes to act as pseudo hunters. These syndicates were selling horn on the black market back home.These rhinos at a feeding site on John Hume’s ranch have recently had their horns trimmed. Unlike elephant ivory, rhino horn grows back when cut properly. Hume estimates that he has five tons in storage, which could bring him some $45 million.In response to the rapacious hunting, South Africa tightened its hunting rules, limiting hunters to one rhino a year, requiring a government official to witness hunts, and denying permits to hunters from Vietnam. The horn of every hunted rhino had to be microchipped and its DNA signature recorded in the Rhino DNA Index System at the University of Pretoria’s Veterinary Genetics Laboratory.Despite all that, rhino horn trafficking continued. There was another soft spot in the international rhino horn ban that CITES couldn’t address: Selling rhino horn within South Africa was legal. But then in 2008 Marthinus van Schalkwyk, minister of environmental affairs and tourism, announced a moratorium on that policy in order “to curb the increase in the illegal trade in rhino horns” and “hopefully discourage poaching.” In February 2009 the ban on domestic sales of rhino horn went into effect. Groenewald has a simple explanation as to why South Africa refuses to legalize rhino horn sales: “Somewhere along in the government,” he tells me, “there must be high rollers involved in this. You understand what I’m saying?”Both Groenewald and John Hume say breeding rhinos for the purpose of harvesting and then legally selling their horns will reduce poaching. But Allison Thomson, director of Outraged South African Citizens Against Poaching, a leading anti-legalization organization, disagrees. “Our law enforcement agencies are already hard-pressed to deal with nearly a thousand arrests in 2015 and a mere 61 convictions. Added pressure to monitor a legal trade would undoubtedly make enforcement near impossible, allowing criminal syndicates once more to traffic more horns into the illegal international market.”Veterinarian Johan Marais (left) prepares to try out a novel treatment—rubber bands used in human surgery—to close a gaping hole in this female rhino’s face made in May 2015 by poachers hacking out her horn. Marais says that Hope—seen here a year later—will survive the attack.A game rancher near Port Elizabeth who couldn’t afford the high cost of protecting his rhinos from poachers sold this one to a more secure operation. The rhino, blindfolded and wearing earplugs to calm it, will be sedated and accompanied by a veterinarian during the 20-hour truck journey to its new home.Lulah’s mother was killed by poachers in Kruger National Park. She now lives at Care for Wild Africa, a sanctuary specializing in rhinos. Staff member Dorota Ladosz lives with her full-time and comforts her after surgery to repair wounds inflicted by hyenas before her rescue.The controversy over rhino horn is coming to a head just as South Africa is hosting the triennial meeting of CITES in Johannesburg in September. In 1997 South Africa had proposed lifting the CITES ban on the international rhino horn trade, touting its legal system as up to the task of ensuring a controlled trade that “will depress black market prices and activity.” But that effort failed.History has shown that removing a trade ban without adequate controls on crime and corruption can be disastrous. In 2007 CITES parties suspended an international ban on trading elephant ivory and authorized four countries—Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe—to sell 115 tons to China and Japan. The sale, which took place the next year, was designed to flood Asia’s ivory markets and drive out illegal traders. Instead it signaled that ivory markets were open again, fueling unprecedented elephant poaching across Africa—more than 30,000 elephants a year between 2010 and 2012 alone—that continues today.“It’s no accident that rhino horn and ivory prices increased around the time CITES started talking about legalizing ivory,” says America’s top wildlife law officer, Chief William Woody of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.There has been speculation that South Africa, with a nudge from its ranching industry, might again propose removing the CITES ban on the international rhino horn trade—despite the awkwardness of the meeting’s host country proposing such a controversial plan. “We have done all in our power [to stop poaching], and doing the same thing every day isn’t working,” South Africa’s environmental affairs minister, Edna Molewa, told the Mail & Guardian during the CITES meeting in Bangkok in 2013. Instead South Africa announced in May that it would not propose lifting the ban, citing the need for evidence that trade would help free-roaming rhinos, expand rhino ranges, and address corruption and challenges in other range states. But then Swaziland, a tiny country with fewer than a hundred rhinos that is locked almost entirely within South Africa, put forward a proposal to lift the ban.Dawie Groenewald ushers us to a long dining table in front of an enormous stone fireplace in the main lodge of his exotic game–breeding ranch. Called Mataka, this is the smaller of his two properties—1,853 acres and 125 miles south of Prachtig. Outside he has two shiny helicopters, a stable of Arabian horses, and acres of high-priced, exotic game he’s going to show me later, including rhinos. Inside are two great rooms filled with black leather sofas and taxidermy.He sits down at the table, and his servant, Andrew, brings him a plate of lamb knuckles—skop, he explains, making a chopping motion with his left hand at his right forearm. Brent and I opt for a bowl of dried beef called biltong and a couple of Cokes.Groenewald started Mataka in 2012, two years after his arrest, but he didn’t end hunting operations at Prachtig. He established a new business, Wild Africa Hunting Safaris, that replaced the original one, Out of Africa Adventurous Safaris. “I had [an American] politician two years ago; he doesn’t even know it’s my place,” he says with obvious delight. Groenewald is clearly confident of his chances in court in South Africa and the U.S. And he has reason to be: The criminal case against him in South Africa has been frozen by a civil lawsuit filed by a game farmer named Johan Krüger, who lives nearby. The lawsuit challenges as unconstitutional South Africa’s ban on the trade of rhino horn, as well as most of the other rhino-related crimes that Groenewald is accused of.“Johan Krüger,” Groenewald tells me, is “on the papers.” But Krüger, who is not implicated in any crimes Groenewald is charged with, is not the true plaintiff, Groenewald says, and is not the one paying the legal bills. “It’s me,” he adds emphatically. Krüger did not respond to National Geographic’s efforts to contact him, but there is reason to believe Groenewald. He and Krüger have been in the buffalo business together; they hunt together; Krüger’s photograph has appeared in Groenewald’s hunting brochures; and Krüger’s lawyer is also Groenewald’s lawyer.South African game rancher Dawie Groenewald faces 1,739 charges related to rhino horn trafficking and rhino poaching. In addition, the United States is seeking to extradite him and his brother. A lawsuit Groenewald is financing that challenges his country’s ban on the sale of rhino horn has put his criminal case on hold.The charges against Groenewald in South Africa are rooted in a September 2010 raid on Prachtig by South Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, an elite police unit known as the Hawks. Markus Hofmeyr, manager of veterinary services for South African National Parks, which runs Kruger National Park, was part of a team of forensic specialists brought in that day to tranquilize Groenewald’s rhinos and collect tissue and blood samples. His team located 29 live rhinos and darted 26 of them.Hofmeyr submitted a sworn affidavit that described what he saw at Prachtig: “All the rhino we darted had their horns removed previously, some right down to the growing point. The horns on some rhino were clearly cut off with a chain saw or the likes.” Cutting a horn too close to its growing point can cause bleeding and, veterinarians say, can be painful. Hofmeyr speculated that some horns had been removed “by inserting a knife and separating the attachment area of the horn from the base of the skull or applying a large force and tearing the horn from the base.”According to Groenewald, the Chinese “don’t like dehorned pieces,” so he cuts his rhinos’ horns down to just three inches from the skull.Investigators also discovered several locations at Prachtig with the remains of burned rhino carcasses and skulls. Nineteen skulls were found, all with their horns cut off. Six years later Hofmeyr is still haunted by the scene. “The thing that was most traumatic for me was seeing that pit with the dead rhinos in it,” he tells me. “It’s very likely he’s going to get off the hook. That’s an indictment of how sick our systems are.”Hofmeyr is sick about something more personal. He recognized rhinos on Groenewald’s property as animals he’d helped capture in Kruger National Park. “[Groenewald] offered the best prices and there was no [criminal] conviction, so according to our tender laws we couldn’t not sell to him.” Selling wildlife to the private sector is one way the park has paid for special conservation projects, he says, and even though some rhinos are sold to safari outfitters to be hunted, they also have a chance to breed, increasing numbers overall. Indeed, breeding for big game hunting is widely credited with helping white rhinos come back from near extinction at the turn of the 20th century.“It takes a long time to recover, takes a long time to trust people again,” Hofmeyr says. “You think, Am I a part of this? I caught that animal, and I put it in that box.” Hofmeyr focuses on the bigger picture—animals he’s helped relocate to other destinations. “I would say 75 percent of them are still alive, and breeding. That, to me, ultimately is what makes it easier to accept these things.”Groenewald, who bought over 30 rhinos from Kruger, says the park charged him by the length of each adult bull’s horn. “They wanted people to hunt them,” he tells me.Of the rhinos that wound up dead at Prachtig, Groenewald sold 39 carcasses to a local butcher.He is clear about who is buying South Africa’s rhino horns. With two index fingers he pulls back the corners of his eyes and says, “The people called me all the time. Because they want some horn. Some horn. Some horn. They don’t get it from me? They’ll get it from somebody else.”“Chinese guys or Vietnamese guys?” Brent asks.“Both,” Groenewald says. “If their eyes are like this, they in it.”In June 2011 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received an email from Col. Johan Jooste of South Africa’s Hawks requesting help interviewing several Americans who had hunted rhinos with Groenewald in South Africa. David Hubbard, agent in charge of the FWS’s San Antonio, Texas, office, was given the assignment.David Hubbard, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is a key agent in Operation Crash, an investigation into U.S. involvement in the illegal rhino horn trade. He manages the case against South African Dawie Groenewald, who’s accused of duping American hunters into illegally shooting rhinos.Hubbard knew Groenewald. Hubbard had assisted in his arrest for shipping a stuffed leopard to the U.S. that had been shot in South Africa without a hunting permit. Groenewald’s client, a plumber from Texas named Glenn Davey, had killed the leopard in 2006. But Groenewald hadn’t had a leopard-hunting permit for that year, and according to his plea agreement his name appeared on a 2008 permit application instead. FWS agents arrested Groenewald in January 2010, when he happened to be visiting his brother, Janneman, who ran their hunting company’s U.S. sales operations from Autaugaville, Alabama. (Janneman has since returned to South Africa.) Groenewald pleaded guilty, was sentenced to time served (eight days), was ordered to refund his client $7,500, and was fined $30,000.“How can they charge me for a leopard that was shot on my place?” Groenewald says, still seething. “I didn’t steal it. I didn’t shoot it on another guy’s farm. It’s mine.”The leopard was killed legally in 2008, he tells me, even though on page 13 of his 2006-07 company brochure there is a photograph of the Texas plumber holding the very same leopard.Five years later, in 2011, Hubbard believed Groenewald was trafficking in wildlife again. Nearly a dozen American men who had gone on hunting adventures with Groenewald’s company told Hubbard a similar story: They hadn’t intended to hunt rhinos, but on their arrival at Prachtig, Groenewald had told them about a “problem” rhino that needed to be put down. Groenewald charged them an average of $10,000—a fraction of the going rate for a legal rhino hunt. The Americans were allowed to photograph their kills, but rhino photos were all they were allowed to take home. Groenewald kept the horns.Hubbard opened his own case, Operation Preposterous, which was rolled into Operation Crash (a group of rhinos is a crash), a multistate rhino horn–trafficking investigation launched by the FWS in 2011. Still active, Operation Crash is one of the agency’s most successful investigations, connecting antique dealers, auction houses, a gang of Irish thieves known as the Rathkeale Rovers, a former associate in Pablo Escobar’s Medellín cartel, and others to rhino horn trafficking in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Africa. As of July 2016, Operation Crash had resulted in the conviction of 30 people, 405 months of prison time, and $75 million in seized property.Unlike most targets of Operation Crash, who trafficked old or antique horn, the Groenewald brothers are accused of killing rhinos. The U.S. Department of Justice charged the brothers with conducting 11 rhino hunts illegal under South African law, in violation of the U.S. Lacey Act, which makes it a crime to violate any U.S. or foreign conservation law. On April 4, 2015, the department contacted South African authorities requesting their extradition. “Getting them extradited back to the U.S. is a high priority for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,” Chief Woody says.But Groenewald appears to have stalled the Americans’ case against him too. “At first we had great cooperation from South Africa,” Hubbard says, recalling early communications with South African prosecutors to prepare for extradition. Then, he says, for some reason official communication between the South African government and the U.S. Department of Justice slowed. Among the reasons for delay, Hubbard speculates, is the Krüger lawsuit. (Citing “matters pending in court,” South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority declined National Geographic’s request for an interview.) The lawsuit also appears to have stalled the prosecution of Groenewald’s longtime associate Hugo Ras, a luxury safari operator and accused rhino killer, whose hunting clients have included Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., sons of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump. Ras is accused of heading a 10-person rhino-poaching and horn-trafficking syndicate that killed rhinos using dart guns and lethal levels of etorphine hydrochloride, also known as M99, a regulated opioid that is up to 80,000 times more powerful than morphine.I climb into Groenewald’s shining Toyota Hilux 4x4 pickup truck, with its bank of modified halogen headlights and luxury padded seat in the bed for viewing wildlife, and we go for a tour of his breeding estate.South African game ranchers breed most anything a safari client will pay to hunt. In 2013 a buffalo named Mystery was sold to an investor group led by Johann Rupert, who controls the world’s second largest luxury-goods conglomerate, Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, for a record $4.1 million. In 2014 Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa sold three white-flanked impalas as breeding stock for $2.5 million, and this year an investor paid $2.8 million for a quarter share in a buffalo named Horizon, putting its value at $11.2 million.Groenewald raises buffalo, impalas, rhinos, sable antelope, and wildebeests, along with Arabian horses. His antelope live with white PVC pipes on the tips of their massive, elegantly curved horns to protect them for market. He also breeds designer animals—highly desired genetic variants such as golden wildebeests, saddleback impalas, and black impalas—animals carrying recessive genes that result in unusual colors. It’s a practice that puts wild populations at risk, according to the African Professional Hunters Association, which considers “color-variant hunting” unethical.The buffalo is among the most dangerous mammals in Africa, but Groenewald drives his truck easily among his. “Buffalo is my animal,” he says fondly. He clicks a button and another fence gate slides open. We approach a group of trophy-size bulls. “This one here is worth about six million rand”—$400,000. Another is worth $675,000. Instead of charging, the big males scamper about like happy sheep.Groenewald’s focus on the animals’ worth was a reminder of what had taken me so long to understand: To Groenewald and many other South Africans, you’re not a poacher if you kill what’s yours. This idea is rooted in the country’s pro-game ranching laws, which make wildlife the property of anyone who can fence it off. “Everybody knows I’m not a poacher,” Groenewald tells me. “I believe that an animal like a rhino should be mine. I can do with that what I want, like any other animal—like a kudu or a buffalo. If I buy that animal, it belongs to me. If you want to shoot the rhino, it’s my rhino; it’s on my farm. If I want you to shoot it, you can shoot it.”For Groenewald what is legal comes down to a single question: When is a rhino mine?These white rhinos crossed from Kruger into Sabie Game Park in Mozambique, where 29 white rhinos and two black rhinos were counted in 2015. Rhinos that enter Mozambique are holding their own thanks to efforts to crack down on poachers—but they remain at very high risk.John Hume owns more rhinos than anyone in the world. He’s been breeding them since 1995, and today he has 1,300. An unlucky number, he tells me, as he takes a seat at his desk in the home office of his rhino ranch in Klerksdorp, a hundred miles southwest of Johannesburg. He’d like at least one more for luck, and he’s checking his computer to see if he’s had another birth.I’ve heard you quoted as saying you’d buy rhinos from the devil if it would save them, I tell him.“Well, if you look at my rhino lists, you’ll see we have plenty of DGs,” he replies. “Probably over a hundred rhino here come from Dawie Groenewald. I don’t deny that. I have nothing to hide, and a lot of those rhino would have been dead today.” (Hume has not been implicated in any of Groenewald’s alleged crimes.)Hume owns about a fifth of South Africa’s privately held rhinos. Part of what makes the rhino special, Hume says, is that it is so “user friendly.” This is a cattle ranch, he says. “You couldn’t keep elephants here.” Each week his staff tranquilizes 10 to 15 rhinos, assists them as they stumble around, trims their horns, gives them reviving shots, and sends the horns by armed guard to a secure facility. His rhinos each produce up to 4.4 pounds of horn a year, and the horns are cut every 20 months or so. He’s been doing this for years and estimates he’s amassed five tons of horn, which he hopes one day to sell legally for more than $4,500 a pound: about $45 million.Although selling rhino horn is illegal, making money off live rhinos isn’t, and Hume has been working to export live rhinos to Vietnam. Last fall he entered negotiations to sell up to a hundred rhinos to a company in Vietnam called Vinpearl, owned by Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam’s wealthiest man. It’s legal for a South African to export live rhinos with government approval, but it’s unclear what kind of life the rhinos would be headed to. According to Hume’s farm manager, wild rhinos each need nearly a thousand acres, but Hume has a captive-breeding permit allowing him to keep one rhino per 7.5 acres as long as he provides them with supplementary food. Vinpearl’s safari park, part of its five-star resort on Phu Quoc Island in the Gulf of Thailand, had allocated a fraction of that to a massive rhino-breeding operation.On December 7, 2015, a representative from Vinpearl, accompanied by the Vietnamese ambassador to South Africa, met with South African authorities to urge approval of Hume’s export application. In a letter, the Department of Rural, Environmental and Agricultural Development for South Africa’s North West Province stated: “Vinpearl intends to import at least 100 rhino, which will be kept on an enclosure of 15 hectares [37 acres]. Vinpearl aims to have the largest number of rhino in the world in a safari park/zoo, and wants to breed rhino.” The government denied Hume’s application.Seven months earlier Hume had taken his own initiative to get the 2009 domestic ban on rhino horn trading lifted when he joined Johan Krüger’s lawsuit as a co-plaintiff—the same lawsuit Groenewald claims is secretly his. Hume relied on a simple technicality to make his case: The government, he said, had failed to adequately notify the public before implementing the ban, because it had failed to consult the world’s top rhino rancher—him—before it enacted its moratorium.Hume’s case was heard on September 22, 2015, World Rhino Day. He won—good news for Groenewald—and the ruling has been upheld through two appeals. The government has filed a final appeal, and the ban remains in force pending the outcome.Meanwhile Groenewald and Hume are both preparing to sell rhino horn. Groenewald tells me that shortly after the win in court last year, he brought a group of eight Asian men to inspect Hume’s rhino horn stockpile. “It’s like you take kids, five or six years old, and you put them in a Toys ‘R’ Us,” Groenewald says.But lifting the domestic ban is only half the rhino bosses’ battle. Because there’s virtually no market for rhino horn in South Africa, they need the international ban to be lifted too. And that’s unlikely, since neither Vietnam nor China has indicated formal interest in legalizing the rhino horn trade. Hume’s lawyer, Izak du Toit, tells me that in extreme circumstances law-abiding people may feel that they have no option other than to break the law as an act of civil disobedience. Private rhino ranchers, who are forbidden to sell their horn and whose staff and animals are under threat from poachers, may choose to trade their horn anyway. He draws a comparison to apartheid: “Black people had to transgress the very law they objected to in order to show it was illegal.”“Who cares what they do with it?” Groenewald says. “If they want to take it illegally out of the country, it’s their problem.”Hume isn’t bothered that rhino horn is snake oil when it comes to treating serious maladies. “I’m not ashamed that the rhino horn I make available to the world could possibly be ingested by somebody who’s got cancer and he dies anyway. It’s not going to help them. I have arthritis. I take at least six bloody remedies. And as far as I can see, none of them work.”What has worked so far, for Dawie Groenewald, is South Africa’s legal system. When it comes to rhino horn, he hopes it works just a little bit more. “If they legalize it, I’m going to be the main man selling it.”",
"Poachers killed this black rhinoceros for its horn with high-caliber bullets at a water hole in South Africa’s Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park. Stirton's images were featured in "Inside the Deadly Rhino Horn Trade."It happened at night. Working quickly and quietly, local poachers snuck into South Africa’s Hluhluwe Imfolozi Game Reserve. They shot a rare black rhino bull with a silencer and then proceeded to saw off its two horns before slipping out of the reserve and eluding discovery. The poachers most likely sold the horns to be smuggled into China or Vietnam. There, the keratin treasures would be peddled as hangover cures and aphrodisiacs, or ground up for traditional medicine.Soon after the poachers absconded, photojournalist Brent Stirton was on-site to take in the crime scene as part of a mission to investigate rhino poaching in South Africa. There are only 5,000 black rhinos left in the world, their numbers decimated by poaching.Now the Natural History Museum recognized Stirton, who shoots mainly for National Geographic, as the 2017 Wildlife Photographer of the Year for his harrowing images of the carnage left behind by illegal hunting.“To make such a tragic scene almost majestic in its sculptural power deserves the highest award,” competition judge Roz Kidman Cox said in a press release. “There is a rawness, but there is also great poignancy and therefore dignity in the fallen giant. It’s also symbolic of one of the most wasteful, cruel and unnecessary environmental crimes, one that needs to provoke the greatest public outcry.”“The great thing with this competition is it just means that, you know, your work gets another life, or it gets seen by that many more people,” Stirton says. “The issue gets a certain longevity.”Stirton joins other photographers, including Steve Winter, Brian Skerry, Thomas P. Peschak, and Charlie Hamilton James in the annual contest, which recognizes the art of nature photography while challenging humans to think deeper about issues facing our planet.",
"Nestled among the entrance ways to the tombs of the Valley of the Kings is a structure known to scholars as KV17. Despite its unpoetic designation, this tomb makes the hearts of Egyptologists beat faster: Built for Seti I, who died in 1279 B.C., it was discovered in 1817, surprising excavators with its richly decorated walls depicting religious beliefs through images of the dead pharaoh and the deities of ancient Egypt.The Valley of the Kings was the burial site of many rulers of Egypt’s New Kingdom (circa 1539-1075 B.C.), when Egypt rose to new heights of power and influence. Building this great desert necropolis began during the reign of Thutmose I, third king of the 18th dynasty, whose rule marked the resurgence of Egypt following a long period of instability. A grand tomb was prepared for Thutmose, cut into the rock of the rugged desert valleys on the Nile’s west bank. The remote spot was chosen to hide lavish royal burials from tomb raiders. Other New Kingdom rulers placed their tombs there, and the necropolis grew. (Judicial power flowed from pharaohs—even after death.)Despite attempts to hide their contents by the use of concealed passages, most tombs—with the famous exception of the tomb of Tutankhamun—were extensively looted, including Seti I’s. However, without golden grave goods or even the pharoah's mummy, Seti’s tomb still had myriad treasures. The priceless art that adorns the walls remained intact to give modern scholars a vivid look into the intricate art that revealed Egyptian spirituality and funerary rituals surrounding the death of a king.In the first century B.C., the historian Diodorus Siculus, described the Valley of the Kings as a ruin. The centuries were not kind to the site as both natural and human causes had further degraded the site. The sincere academic interest of French scholars following Napoleon’s 1798 invasion of Egypt was matched by keen commercial interest in antiquities. In the early 1800s many objects across Egypt were pillaged for the European market.When Italian adventurer and former circus strongman Giovanni Belzoni arrived in Egypt in 1815, the country was under British control. Belzoni’s status, a combination of explorer and tomb robber, did not deter the British consul, Henry Salt, from using his services to help transport a massive head of Ramses II to Alexandria, from where it was shipped to the British Museum in London. Belzoni also became embroiled in a turf war with the French consul, who employed gangs of tomb raiders to track down antiquities.The translucent alabaster coffin, discovered by Giovanni Belzoni, was removed from the tomb and taken to London in the early 1820s. The sarcophagus features carved hieroglyphics from the Book of Gates.As part of his campaign to best a French rival, Belzoni befriended local people near the Valley of the Kings who worked as tomb robbers. Thanks to their information, he became familiar with the site. Despite his mercenary streak, Belzoni was genuinely interested in archaeology. He studied the valley’s topography and noted how fast draining rainwater could indicate hidden openings. (Priest-embalmers offered burial packages for every budget.)In winter 1816 Belzoni located the tomb of the 18th-dynasty pharaoh Ay. In October of the following year, his men discovered the tomb of Ramses I, founder of the 19th dynasty. In the course of that discovery, Belzoni noticed another small hollow that easily absorbed rainwater, suggesting that a cavity lay beneath. On digging, his team found a rubble-filled entrance. Once the debris was cleared, they could glimpse magnificent wall decorations beyond.While exploring the tomb, Belzoni found an embalmed bull, leading him to believe the tomb was dedicated to Apis, the holy bull worshipped in northern Egypt. He did not identify the tomb as that of Seti I, or of any ruler, because nowhere in the tomb was there a human mummy.Despite his ignorance as to the identity of the tomb’s original occupant, Belzoni recognized that the paintings adorning the interior were exceptional. In the months following the discovery, Belzoni took wax impressions of them, which damaged the reliefs. He also painted watercolors of the tomb art.When Belzoni reached the burial chamber whose magnificent painted ceiling represents the heavens, he found an empty alabaster sarcophagus. The coffin was found laying across a staircase that led down to a long and mysterious corridor, which Belzoni’s men gave up exploring after a hundred yards. The sarcophagus was removed from the tomb and eventually acquired by the English collector Sir John Soane (today it is in London, England, in the museum that bears Soane’s name).Not only were the tomb’s artworks breathtaking to see, they also provided today’s Egyptologists with the earliest, most complete set of funerary texts from ancient Egypt. Wall paintings depict detailed scenes from the Book of Amduat and texts from the Litany of Re, a collection of invocations and prayers to the solar deity. The giant sarcophagus is decorated with scenes from the Book of Gates—an Egyptian text that recounts the passage of a soul through the underworld—and is today regarded as one of the most important artifacts from Egypt’s 19th dynasty. (Discover the sacred and secret rituals in the Book of the Dead.)For years after the discovery, the tomb would be identified with various rulers. But in 1828 French scholar Jean-François Champollion deciphered hieroglyphics in the tomb to identify it as that of Seti I. One of the 19th dynasty’s greatest rulers, and father of Ramses II, Seti I ruled for 11 years during which he expanded Egypt’s influence south to Nubia and northeast to Syria. Archaeologists would later find the king’s mummy in the Royal Mummy Cache nearby, where it had been moved in antiquity for safekeeping.Study of the tomb continued into the next century. In 1903 Howard Carter, future discoverer of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1922, re-excavated Seti I’s tomb using meticulous care and scholarly methods to record the tomb’s contents. More than a century later, Egyptologist Zahi Hawass finally excavated the tunnel that Belzoni had found leading downward from the sepulchral chamber. He discovered that it ends abruptly after 570 feet, and concluded it may have been intended to link the burial chamber with the realm of the dead. (Short on time, Carter almost didn't discover King Tut's tomb.)Since Belzoni’s first excavation, exposure to the elements and human visitors have damaged Seti’s tomb, but conservation efforts strive to protect and preserve it. In 2016 the Factum Foundation used the latest technology to scan and photograph the entire complex not only to preserve and study its artworks, but also to create high-precision facsimiles that can be printed to erect full-size models of the tomb in full color. Visitors can experience the majesty of a pharaoh’s resting place without endangering the original. The excavation of the tomb is largely complete, but its aura of enigma will linger, it seems, for centuries to come.The entrance to Seti’s tomb leads to a series of preliminary corridors and chambers. The walls in these opening chambers are covered with myriad artworks (in the form of colored reliefs) depicting funerary texts centering on the sun god Re. One of these is the New Kingdom Book of Amduat, showing the journey taken each night by Re. Over the course of 12 hours, he must overcome obstacles using the magical texts shown on the walls. The walls also feature texts from the Litany of Re, a collection of invocations and prayers to the solar deity. Visitors descend a set of stairs and then proceed through three corridors.In the first room, Seti I can be seen greeting the god Re-Horakhty in a scene from the Litany of Re, which associates the deceased pharaoh with the various forms of the sun god. A succession of vultures representing the goddess Nekhbet appear on the ceiling against a starry background. Images from the Litany also appear in the second stairway and depict Re in different forms. The next corridor depicts different stages of Re’s nightly journey on the left and right walls, as recounted in the Book of Amduat. A visitor’s journey then pauses at the well chamber, which symbolizes the burial of Osiris, god of the underworld. Artworks here show gods welcoming the deceased pharaoh.After the Well of Osiris, visitors pass into a room supported by four richly adorned pillars. Whereas the preliminary corridors and chambers centered on the role of the solar god Re, this space marks a shift in tone to a type of art that historians term “chthonic” (related to the underworld). The artwork in this room depicts scenes from the Book of Gates, a funerary text that recounts the deceased’s journey through the underworld, in which each hour of the night is marked by a heavily guarded gate. Although the Book of Gates may predate the New Kingdom, its first usage in a royal tomb is found in the funerary chamber of Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the 18th dynasty.The unfinished decoration in the two-pillared side chamber depicts Maat, the goddess of order and justice, offering an ankh, a symbol of rebirth, to the deceased pharoah.The falcon-headed Horus and the blue-skinned Ptah counsel the deceased Seti I on the painted columns in his tomb.On each side of these columns. the soul of the deceased Seti I consults with a divinity. On the rear wall of the chamber, Seti is welcomed by Osiris, god of the underworld. A door leads to a two-pillared side chamber whose walls are covered with unfinished decorations that were sketched out in great detail, but color had not been added when Seti I was entombed. Stairs proceed down to the lower levels of the tomb to continue the journey toward the burial chamber. (Here's how to make a mummy in 70 days or less.)Descending the stairs from the pillared chamber, visitors reach another corridor with walls that show Seti I standing in front of an offering table. Artworks on the left wall show a set of texts and images connected with the Opening of the Mouth ritual, a ceremony in which a series of ritual tools are applied to a likeness of the deceased to enable them to regain the faculties of a living, speaking, and eating being in the afterlife. The ceremony has its roots in the Old Kingdom, but its depiction in tomb art is rare. Only one other royal New Kingdom tomb—that of 19th-dynasty Queen Tawosret—has extensive depictions of it.A passageway begins with stairs and wall paintings of protective winged serpents before entering a room decorated with more scenes of the Opening of the Mouth and excerpts from the Litany of the Eye of Horus. This funerary text allowed the deceased to partake in a series of offerings to the god. An antechamber follows, with breathtaking paintings of the starry sky on the ceiling. The polychrome wall paintings were greatly damaged by Belzoni, who made direct copies of the colored reliefs using wax molds.After the antechamber comes the splendor of the burial complex itself, which would have housed the pharaoh’s mummy. Following the precedent established in the tomb of Amenhotep II a century before, the room is divided into two sections: an upper chamber, originally supported by six richly adorned pillars, and a lower chamber with a high, vaulted ceiling painted with stunning depictions of Egyptian deities. At 20 feet high, the curved structure symbolizes the celestial vault, and a series of gods and goddesses can be seen proceeding toward symbols of constellations painted in the form of animals. The walls are decorated with scenes from the Book of Amduat. Presiding from the highest point on the rear wall, the goddess Isis spreads her wings.It was here, under this beautiful vaulted ceiling, that Belzoni found Seti’s empty alabaster sarcophagus. Some theorize that ancient looters left it behind because its bulk made it nearly impossible to move. Perplexing archaeologists for nearly two centuries is the long, uncompleted tunnel that stretches downward (Egyptologist Zahi Hawass excavated it in the 2000s and found that it went to nowhere). Many scholars believe the long descending tunnel was meant to link Seti’s earthly resting place with the realm of the dead far below. (Isis was worshipped from Egypt to England.)The upper burial chamber has two small side annexes. When Howard Carter discovered the largely intact tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, he found annexes there that served as storage for the afterlife. They were filled with pottery, games, and even food. The annex contents of Seti’s tomb may have contained similar objects that were probably looted long ago. The first storeroom is decorated with scenes from the Book of Gates, while a twin annex directly opposite shows scenes from the Book of the Heavenly Cow, which recounts how the goddess Nut ascended to create the celestial vault.According to the story, when the height made her teeter, she had to be supported by several divinities. The lower burial chamber also has two annexes. A square chamber’s two supporting pillars are covered with figures, including the deceased pharaoh, associated with the god Osiris, and more images from the Book of Amduat. At the rear of the complex is another undecorated storeroom. Here Belzoni found the mummified bull and numerous ushabtis, figurines made of wood and faience that would serve the deceased in the afterlife.A mysterious long passageway leads downward from Seti I’s funerary chambers, and for nearly two centuries, no one knew where it went. In 1817 Belzoni followed it for some distance before turning back. Speculation mounted that the tunnel, its lower sections filled with rubble, might hide the “real” resting place of the pharaoh. In 1960 an amateur local archaeologist cleared an additional 100 feet but then took a wrong turn and lost the course of the original passageway.Finally, in 2007, a team led by Egyptian antiquities chief Zahi Hawass began three years of careful rubble-clearing. In 2010 they discovered the 570-foot-long tunnel came to an abrupt end with no further chambers. Hawass believes the corridor may have been intended to link the burial chamber to the underworld, but it was left unfinished when Seti I died.",
"Egypt’s first laws emerged when the Upper and Lower kingdoms were unified, according to tradition, under King Menes around 2950 B.C. From then on, different pharaohs would bring their own approaches to law and order. Although rulers would change, the unifying principle of the monarch’s sovereignty did not. Pharaohs held supreme authority in settling disputes, but they often delegated these powers to other officials such as governors, viziers, and magistrates, who could conduct investigations, hold trials, and issue punishments. Unlike the legal Code of Hammurabi, developed in the 18th century B.C. in Mesopotamia, ancient Egyptian law was not set in stone, and although power always flowed from the pharaoh, Egypt’s laws were rather like the Nile: fluid, organic, and changing with the times. (See also: The truth behind Egypt's female pharaohs and their power.)In Egyptian cosmology, the goddess Maat embodied the concepts of order, truth, and justice. Viziers often wore a pendant in the form of the goddess, who is often shown with an ostrich feather on her head. Egyptians believed that living according to her precepts—honesty, loyalty, and obedience to the king—would keep chaos at bay. Egyptian kings were not exempt from living by Maat’s principles. They too were expected to uphold order through wise rule, just decisions, and humility before the gods. This belief united commoners and kings in the responsibility for maintaining balance and harmony in society, which may have led to fewer periods of civil unrest in Egypt’s long history.Crimes in ancient Egypt tended to be divided into two categories: crimes against the state and crimes against individuals. Desertion, treason, and slandering the pharaoh fell into the first, while acts such as homicide, injury, robbery, and theft fell into the second. Much of what is known about ancient Egypt’s legal system comes from the New Kingdom period (ca 1539-1075 B.C.) and the archaeological site of Deir el Medina, across the Nile from Thebes. Located there was a village of artisans and workers, who labored in the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, building tombs for pharaohs and their families. Digs at Deir el Medina have yielded more than 250 papyri and some ostraca (fragments of stone and potsherds) containing detailed accounts of legal matters at all levels of society. (See also: National Geographic to host exhibition "Queens of Egypt.")Egyptian pharaohs were expected to rule in perfect balance and harmony, which they called "Maat." The concept signified order, truth, and justice and was embodied by a goddess of the same name who wore an ostrich feather headdress. According to Egyptian theology, Maat's feather would be weighed against a deceased person's heart to measure how virtuous a life had been. Egyptian writings emphasize that the king, as the intermediary between the gods and humankind, had a duty to ensure Maat in Egypt: “Ra has placed the king in the land of the living forever and ever . . . to guarantee Maat and to wipe out Isfet [chaos and injustice],” says a theological treaty written in the time of Queen Hatshepsut (1490-1468 B.C.). The vizier, Egypt’s supreme legal authority, held the title Priest of Maat, and often wore amulets featuring emblems of the goddess.The texts reveal the different ways that people could seek justice. One of the most popular was the use of divine oracles. In and around Thebes the oracular voice was attributed to a deceased pharaoh, Amenhotep I, the focus of an important Theban cult. The second king of the 18th dynasty, Amenhotep I consolidated Egyptian power following his father’s expulsion of the Hyksos invaders from Lower Egypt. Although his own tomb has not been found, Amenhotep I is believed to have started the tradition of rulers being buried in the Valley of the Kings. He and his mother, Ahmose Nefertari, are also credited with founding the village at Deir el Medina and were worshipped as patron gods there. (See also: We may now know which Egyptian pharaoh challenged Moses.)Although it was common for especially renowned pharaohs to become the center of cults after their death, Amenhotep’s is among the most popular and enduring. Egyptians believed that his spirit resided in his oracular statue and proper ceremonies could summon it. Residents often turned to the statue to settle legal disputes.Bearing Amenhotep I’s statue on their shoulders, priests would carry it out of the temple during processions and on feast days. A crowd would gather around it, and litigants would present their cases to the statue. Each side would present its case or question, either verbally or in writing. The god’s answers were interpreted by its swaying movements.The workers consulted the statue for centuries. One fragment from the Deir el Medina site dates to the 20th dynasty. It records the request of a workman, Nekhemmut, who asked the statue to reveal the identity of a person who was stealing from him. From the records found among the ostraca, most inquiries were similar, mundane matters, centering on real estate and personal property.Oracular statues were also consulted in other parts of Egypt during the New Kingdom. Located close to Thebes, a statue of the god Amun was also consulted on legal matters. Sometimes, those accused by an oracle would protest against the verdict, and ask for the matter to be put before another oracular statue for a second opinion. Inscribed during the reign of Ramses III, papyrus 10335 (now in the British Museum) recounts the theft of five dyed tunics from a temple storehouse. The crime was brought before an oracle. The statue’s answers fingered one suspect from a list of names as the guilty party. The accused vociferously denied the charge and requested a second and then a third opinion. After his last request, the patience of the gods, and the crowd, ran out. He was found guilty, beaten on the spot as punishment, and forced to restore the stolen goods to the temple.The snake goddess Meretseger was revered and feared by the people of Thebes who built the Valley of the Kings. Her name means “she who loves silence,” and she guarded the tombs in the Theban necropolis. Workers also referred to her as “Peak of the West,” a nod to the pyramid-shaped mountaintop (known today as Al Qurn) above the Valley of the Kings, where she dwelled. The goddess’s appearance varies across different works of art, but snakes feature heavily in her iconography; often she is shown as a coiled cobra with a woman’s head. The workers of Thebes believed that the goddess punished criminals and oath breakers with blindness and venomous snakebites.In addition to the oracles, there was another, more formal method of resolving legal disputes during the New Kingdom. The kenbet (secular court) most closely resembles the approach of modern trials by jury. Two major kenbets were located in Memphis and Thebes and functioned like a high court. The major kenbet juries consisted of higher-ranking members of society, such as scribes of the vizier of Thebes or police chiefs. There is evidence that access to the kenbet service was surprisingly democratic, and that petitioners of higher social status were not given preferential treatment.The kenbet typically handled civil issues such as nonpayment for goods or services, disputes and quarrels between neighbors, theft, injuries, and calumnies. The kenbets were empowered to administer punishments for the minor offenses that came before them, which usually entailed the guilty party suffering a beating. In a few cases, when a kenbet could not reach a decision, it would recommend that the question be submitted to the oracular statues for resolution.Lesser kenbet councils sat in the region’s smaller towns, like the builders’ village. They would hear complaints of local residents and decide their cases. Scholars believe that juries consisted of craftsmen and artisans, who would sit in judgment over their fellow workers. If a serious crime originated in the lower kenbet, it would be moved up the legal system to the major kenbet councils, which reported directly to the vizier, the pharaoh’s principal minister.Famous among historians, one case originated in the local kenbet near Deir el Medina. The accused, a woman called Heria, was initially charged with stealing a cup from a resident. The lower kenbet ordered that Heria’s house be searched for the missing property. The search revealed not only the cup but also goods missing from the temple of Amun. Theft from a temple was a more serious crime. The kenbet found Heria guilty of stealing the cup and then passed the matter of the stolen temple goods to be judged by the vizier. When passing off the case, the kenbet sent a letter to the vizier noting its thoughts: “Heria is a great fraud who deserves to die.”The vizier was one of the most powerful officials in Egypt. Second in power only to the pharaoh, he oversaw the administrative functions of the government. For serious crimes, the vizier served as judge and could dole out punishments or grant pardons. (See also: 25 captivating photos of Egypt.)A papyrus known as Salt 124 details a case from the 20th dynasty that was heard by the vizier. The case was brought by Amennakht, a worker at Deir el Medina, against another worker, Paneb. The list of crimes was long: Amennakht charged Paneb with theft, looting tombs, death threats, bribery, misappropriation of tools belonging to the government, bullying the villagers, sexual assault, blasphemy, and murder. Paneb defended himself by claiming that Amennakht was seeking revenge because he felt Paneb had stolen a job from him.The case most likely came before the vizier because of the charges of tomb raiding. Stealing from one’s neighbor was a crime for the kenbet. Stealing from the royal dead or from Egyptian temples was a much graver offense.When people were convicted of crimes, the penalties depended both on the severity of the offense and their level of involvement. The typical penalty for stealing was returning the stolen object and paying its rightful owner double or triple its value. If someone stole from a temple, however, the punishment was more severe: it could include paying a hundred times the value of the object, corporal punishment, or even death.Little evidence has been found for imprisonment in ancient Egypt. Criminal punishment tended to be administered immediately rather than by means of a long sentence. Forced labor was common, and criminals were also threatened with exile to Nubia, where scholars believe they were put to work in mines. Corporal punishment was also common in the form of public beatings, brandings, or mutilations.The most serious crimes, like treason, were punishable by death. One of the most famous occurrences of the death penalty resulted from the harem conspiracy against Ramses III in the early 12th century B.C. The Judicial Papyrus of Turin documents the plot and how the king’s secondary wife, Tiye, conspired to kill Ramses and install her son, Pentawere, on the throne.Part of Tiye’s plot succeeded: Analysis of Ramses III’s mummy revealed that his throat had been slashed, and he did not survive the attack. The other part of Tiye’s plot failed: The conspiracy was uncovered before Pentawere could take the throne. Ramses IV quickly shored up his power as the new king and turned to punishing his father’s assassins.The Judicial Papyrus extensively details the charges, trials, and punishments of those involved in the wide-ranging conspiracy, who held positions at all levels of Ramses III’s court, from harem officials to servants. Penalties ranged from death to mutilation. Tiye’s chief conspirator received a harsh sentence:The great criminal Paibekkamen . . . had been in collusion with Teye [sic] and the women of the harem; he had made common cause with them . . . He was placed before the great officials of the Court of Examination; . . . his crimes seized him; the officials who examined him caused his punishment to overtake him.How the law dealt with Queen Tiye is unknown, but her son Pentawere was allowed to commit suicide. Scholars believe the lesser conspirators were put to death by impalement. The pharaoh’s justice was unrelenting because his role in keeping order, according to Maat’s principles, was critical to preserving the well-being of Egypt.",

"In Arabic, it’s called “the father of terror.” To us, it’s a riddle.Who built the Great Sphinx of Giza? No one can say for sure (though several of the more crazy theories point fingers at space aliens). The huge limestone statue, as tall as the White House in Washington, D.C., with paws bigger than city buses, was erected in the time of the Old Kingdom, probably during the reign of the Pharaoh Khafre, between the years 2558 and 2532 B.C.The crouching lion with a man’s head was ancient when Cleopatra gazed upon it in 47 B.C. It retains its allure to the powerful, as world leaders from Napoleon to Barack Obama have trekked to Giza to contemplate the same view that captivated the queen of the Nile.Name game: The Sphinx is an alias, created by the ancient Greeks when the statue was already centuries old. The early name was Hor-em-akhet, meaning “Horus in the horizon.” Horus is the Egyptian god of the sky.Test of time: Out of the seven wonders of the ancient world, only the Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx are still standing.Color me mysterious: The Sphinx was originally painted in garish comic-book colors like red. Traces of the pigment can be seen by its ear.Copycat: In Las Vegas, the Egyptian-themed Luxor Hotel‘s foam and plaster version is 35 feet taller than the original Sphinx, which rises 66 feet.Close shave: The Sphinx originally sported a beard, which eventually crumbled. A piece of its “stubble” is displayed in the British Museum in London.Secrets and lies: Legend says the library of the sunken island of Atlantis is stowed beneath the Sphinx, with an entrance near its right paw. Nothing has been found, according to bemused archaeologists.Nose job: Contrary to popular history, Napoleon’s cannonballs did not shoot off the Sphinx’s nose. The evidence suggests the nose was intentionally cleaved off at least 300 years before the Little Corporal invaded Egypt in 1798.Pyramid scheme: If you don’t like the Saharan sun, try booking a seat for the sound-and-light show at night when desert temperatures are cooler.

"Mummies are often a star attraction at many of the world’s great museums. Their temperature-controlled glass cabinets protect and preserve these bodies, which are thousands of years old. Locked within them is the history of how people lived along the Nile many millennia ago. Modern scholars treat them with reverence and great care, but it was not always the case.Until very recently, Egyptian mummies were used by Europeans for practical rather than academic purposes. Their bodies were treated as a commodity because of the medical, supernatural, and physical characteristics they were believed to possess. Starting in the 15th century, merchants sought to profit from trafficking mummies out of Egypt and into Europe, and a robust “mummy trade” grew around them.Mummification was a complex, lengthy process that helped preserve the body for its journey in the afterlife. Although the process changed over time, many of its core practices remained the same. After removing the body’s internal organs, priests would use natron, a naturally occurring salt, to dry it out. Sometimes fragrant substances, like myrrh, were used to anoint the body. Oils and resins would be applied to the body, which would then be stuffed with linen rags or sawdust before being sealed and wrapped in bandages. (Learn more about the mummification process.)Scholars have had difficulty pinning down exactly how mummies came to be used for medicine. There is evidence that Europeans believed that embalmed bodies contained otherworldly healing powers. Other scholars trace the relationship’s origin to the misconception that mummies contained bitumen, a substance long associated with healing in the ancient world.Black, sticky, and viscous, bitumen is a form of petroleum found in areas around the Dead Sea. First-century A.D. writers Pliny the Elder and Dioscorides, as well as the second-century A.D. Galen, wrote about its healing properties. Dioscorides described one form as a liquid from Apollonia (modern Albania) known, in Persian, as mumiya. According to Pliny, it could heal wounds and a range of maladies. (These cultures also preserve their dead.)European scholars in the Middle Ages associated bitumen with a blackish substance found in the tombs of Egypt. An 11th-century physician, Constantinus Africanus, wrote that mumiya “is a spice found in the sepulchers of the dead . . . That is best which is black, ill-smelling, shiny, and massive.”Europe began to link mummies with medicine in the 15th century, in response to a robust demand for medical mumiya. Naturally occurring bitumen was rare, so enterprising merchants went hunting in Egyptian tombs for alternative supplies. When ground to a powder, those preserved bodies and their resins, oils, and aromatic substances not only had the same consistency and color as original Persian mumiya but also smelled better.It was not always easy to acquire a mummy, so less scrupulous Eastern merchants decided to make their own. Apothecaries noticed a difference. As Guy de La Fontaine complained in 1564, after his journey to Alexandria to acquire the drug, the problem was that in many instances the mummies were modern corpses treated to resemble ancient mummies. A distinction was then drawn between primary or true mumiya and secondary or false mumiya.The process of turning a recently deceased human being into a persuasive facsimile of an ancient Egyptian mummy was an unpleasant one. Luis de Urreta, a Spanish monk in the Dominican Order, gives a detailed account of the murderous and grim method used in his 1610 work Historia de los reynos de la Etiopía (History of the Kingdoms of Ethiopia). The procedure consisted of repeatedly starving a captive and giving him special “medications” before cutting off his head as he slept. The body was then drained of blood, filled with spices, wrapped in hay, and buried for 15 days. After exhumation, it dried in the sun for 24 hours. By the end of this gruesome process, the flesh had darkened and transformed. The monk described it as being not only cleaner and finer than that of ancient mummies but also more effective.Benoîte de Maillet, the French consul in Egypt between 1692 and 1708, was the first European to stage a mummy unwrapping in front of an audience. The event took place in Cairo in September 1698. Maillet did not take notes of his process or methods, but he did detail some of the amulets and objects found among the wrappings.Not everyone sang the praises of mumiya as a drug, regardless of whether it was “true” or “false.” As early as 1582, the Frenchman Ambroise Paré wrote in his Discours de la mumie,“the effect of this malevolent drug is such that not only does it do nothing whatsoever to improve patients, as I have seen for myself on numerous occasions among those forced to take it, but it also causes them terrible stomach pains, a foul smell in the mouth, and great vomiting, which are the origin of disorders in the blood and even make it flow from the vessels that contain it.”Europeans used ground up mummies as medicine, but they also used them in art. From at least the 16th century, a pigment called “mummy brown” was made from mummified human remains and appeared on the palettes of European artists. To mix the pigment, ground-up ancient bodies were mixed with pitch and myrrh. At the time, apothecaries, who were responsible for producing medicines made out of mummies, would often double as mixers of the pigment, making it easy to make the leap from medicine cabinet to artist’s palette.An Egyptian widow mourns her mummified husband in this 1872 work by Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Despite his knowledge of mummy brown's origins, it is not known if the artist used the pigment in this painting.Historical records date mummy brown’s early use to the Renaissance. Painters were said to prize mummy brown for its richness and versatility; they often used it for shading, chiaroscuro, and, appropriately, flesh tones.In 1881 a hidden tomb of royal mummies was discovered at Deir el Bahri in the Theban Necropolis. The site known as the Royal Cache (or tomb DB320) was found to contain the remains of many powerful 18th- and 19th-dynasty pharaohs, including Thutmose III, Seti I, and Ramses II. Egyptologists believed they were transferred to this cache for safekeeping sometime during the 21st dynasty (11th and 10th centuries B.C.) in a successful attempt to elude looters.How often it was used and in what specific paintings has been difficult for art historians to ascertain, but the color remained in use until the Romantic painters of the late 19th century. Many artists did keep the color in stock, such as Pre- Raphaelite painters Edward Burne-Jones and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Eugène Delacroix, one of the greatest painters of France’s 19th-century Romantic school, is known for the large areas of shadow and gloom on his canvases, which have struck scholars as likely candidates for the use of mummy brown.The economic demand for mumiya worked in parallel with the equally powerful forces of fear and superstition. Even though, from the classical period onward, the occasional Greek or Roman traveler returned home from a trip to Egypt with a mummified animal, it seems that prior to the 15th century, there was little interest in transporting mummies to Europe as mementos or collector’s objects.Mummies were perceived as powerful spiritual objects. This lingering superstition survived well into the 20th century. Howard Carter’s 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun inspired tales of the “mummy’s curse” that protected the pharaoh’s tomb and killed several members of Carter’s team.This fear has deep roots in the European imagination, and preyed on the guilty minds of tomb robbers. Renaissance-era chronicles tell of Octavius Fagnola, a 16th-century Christian who converted to Islam. He had been a tomb robber in Egypt. While at work among the graves of Giza, he came across a corpse with no internal organs wrapped in an ox skin and containing a scarab, a kind of amulet that was thought to protect the heart.Dodging the customs men and loading the mummy onto a ship bound for Italy proved to be the easy part. Halfway through the voyage, a violent storm rose up; it seemed like the ship would be lost. “The corpses of Egyptians always stir up storms,” reflected Fagnola, and consign his mummy to the waters that night.The mummy craze led to a macabre souvenir trade. Here, a mummy vendor resting by his wares in Egypt was photographed around 1877.Such stories were commonplace in 16th-century Europe, when the Christian world and the Ottoman Empire were vying for control of the Mediterranean. At the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League defeated the Turkish fleet. Following this decisive victory, the news raced around the Mediterranean’s bustling ports, which were fertile ground for gossip. A rumor circulated that the Turks were doomed by having a mummy aboard one of their ships. The defeat that followed only served to reinforce the idea that mummies exercised a power to inflict maritime disaster on the unwary.Fear of such objects was not enough to cause a drop in demand in Europe for medicine derived from mummies. The 16th-century Ottoman authorities who ruled Egypt enacted laws to control the trade in mummies. This measure backfired, creating a lucrative black market.By the 18th century, using mummies as medicine had fallen from favor. European attitudes toward mummies were shifting, and scholars began to be more interested in what lay under the winding sheets of a mummy’s wrappings. Unwrapping a mummy would become an event, one that could be hosted in a private home or, later, in a public theater. The first recorded account of a mummy unwrapping occurred in 1698. Benoît de Maillet, the French consul in Cairo, was the first European to delve beneath the bindings and take extensive notes. In the early 1700s, Christian Hertzog, apothecary to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, unwrapped a mummy in front of an audience. He published his findings in the book Mumiographia, a detailed account of the artifacts found inside.So states the invitation sent by Lord Londesborough for June 10, 1850. The nobleman organized this event at his London residence, officiated by Samuel Birch, Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum. Birch had no medical training and gives few details concerning the physical condition of the mummy. Those attending the event watched with delight as a copy of the Book of the Dead, various amulets, and some beautiful silver gloves appeared amid the wrappings.The public study of mummies continued and reached a new peak in the early 19th century after the Napoleonic Wars and English colonialism were stirring up new interest in ancient Egypt. Throughout the 19th century, public mummy unwrappings were highly popular events in England. The man who pioneered them was Thomas Pettigrew, a 19th-century English surgeon, who became known later in life as “Mummy Pettigrew.” He began his Egyptology career as assistant to Giovanni Battista Belzoni, the Italian explorer who discovered the tomb of Seti I in 1817. An astonishing find, the tomb was missing its mummy.As part of an exhibition of reliefs from Seti’s tomb, Belzoni, aided by Pettigrew, unwrapped a mummy before a group of physicians in 1821. Pettigrew became fascinated himself and began a lifelong career in the study of Egypt. In 1834 he published a treatise on mummies that included descriptions of the objects found inside.Pettigrew’s public dissections of mummies were wildly popular in the 1830s. Spectators were left spellbound or nauseated as the face—gaunt and desiccated but nevertheless that of a recognizable human being, dead for many thousands of years—was gradually revealed from beneath its protective garments.After noting that one individual had a large bone tumor, Pettigrew began to see how a mummy was a record of a real person. He understood that his investigations could reconstruct the details of an individual life. Pettigrew’s insight moved the study of mummies away from pure public spectacle (though it partly remained that) and into the realm of scientific analysis. His A History of Egyptian Mummies is considered as one of the founding texts of Egyptology.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a series of important archaeological discoveries provided new insights as Egyptology was developing into a more formal discipline. In 1881 a huge cache of royal mummies from the New Kingdom—including Seti I’s missing body— was discovered in the Theban Necropolis, followed in 1898 by the tomb of Amenhotep II in the Valley of the Kings. Many of these mummies were unwrapped, but their physical appearances and any artifacts were carefully documented according to the academic practices of the time. (See nine photographs of extraordinary mummies from around the world.)In the early 1900s new methods for studying mummies came into practice. Grafton Elliot Smith, an anatomist at the Cairo School of Medicine, photographed the royal mummies. His 1912 book, Catalogue of the Royal Mummies in the Museum of Cairo, is still used as a reference. Smith was the first to use x-rays on mummies.Mummies were beginning to be seen as precious repositories of knowledge in addition to being human remains that demanded respect. Some old habits died hard, however. As late as 1900, a tomb believed to hold Pharaoh Djer, who died circa 3055 B.C., was excavated. Djer is thought to be the third king from the 1st dynasty, one of the first rulers to preside over a unified Egypt. Yet when a mummified arm, complete with bracelets, was found, the jewelry was carefully removed and preserved. As for the arm, it was noted, photographed, and thrown in the trash—an act that would fill modern scholars with horror and outrage.",

"Throughout the 1800s, the new archaeological discipline of Egyptology fed a keen public appetite for stories about pyramids and mummies. An 1869 story by Louisa May Alcott, “Lost in a Pyramid,” recounts an archaeologist bringing down a curse on himself when he destroys the mummy of a young girl. “I sometimes wonder if I am to share the curse,” recounts his assistant later, “For I’ve a vein of superstition in me, and that poor little mummy haunts my dreams still.”Mummies have haunted popular culture ever since. By the time of Howard Carter’s discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1922, the idea of a “mummy’s curse” was already well established in early cinema. Mummies have been Hollywood staples since horror superstar Boris Karloff starred in The Mummy in 1932. The 1999 movie The Mummy and its sequel The Mummy Returns continued the trend of the mummy as a tormented, vengeful being caught somewhere between life and death.circa 3000 B.C.Before this date, the dead are generally buried in desert graves, whose sands dry and preserve the bodies.2572-2130 B.C.In the Old Kingdom, some pharaohs are buried in large pyramids. Mummification is developed so that the royal bodies do not decompose.1938-1630 B.C.During the Middle Kingdom, mummification is extended to the wider population and varies in complexity according to clients’ budgets.1552-1069 B.C.Techniques are perfected during the New Kingdom, a period in which it also becomes customary to bury papyri with mummies.664-332 B.C.During the Late Period, there is a boom in mummified animals. Many of them are given to the gods as offerings.2nd century A.D.Mummification disappears with the spread of Christianity. A new set of beliefs about the afterlife takes hold.Why did the Ancient Egyptians develop this costly, and to contemporary eyes, ghoulish ritual? Only by stripping away modern associations can the significance of mummies be understood. Objects of awe and mystery, they were created out of respect both for the gods and the deceased, and regarded as a natural continuation of the journey after death.Mummification has deep roots in Egypt’s climate and geography. The oldest mummies date back to the fourth millennium B.C. and received no elaborate preservation at all. At that time, bodies were buried without any kind of casket in the desert, where conditions dried and preserved the remains. As customs changed in early Egyptian society, bodies began to be placed inside caskets and tombs. Separating bodies from the ground inhibited the corpses’ drying out, so Egyptians began to develop techniques to preserve bodies before burial.These techniques were closely connected with religious beliefs, which described people as an amalgam of elements. Some of these were material: a person’s body, shadow, and name. Others were associated with their spirit: the ka, or cosmic energy received at birth; the ankh, or vital breath; and the ba, the personality. These elements were momentarily separated when a person died—a source of much anguish to the Egyptian mind. Mummification allowed the spirit of the deceased to recognize its own body, joyfully return to it, and be reborn.The ritual mirrored the story of Osiris, god of the underworld, who was killed by his brother, Seth. Osiris’s murderer scattered his body parts across the land. Only when his consort Isis intervened, reuniting and burying the fragments, could Osiris be restored to life. In Egyptian art Osiris is often mummified, a task carried out by the god Anubis. The myth underscores how Egyptians believed the soul had no hope to navigate the hereafter unless its body was whole.When the Greek historian Herodotus toured Egypt in the middle of the fifth century B.C., he took a keen interest in mum­mification techniques, which he described in some detail in his Histories. His account also mentions a curious anecdote about “wooden models of corpses” at high so­ciety banquets.“In social gatherings among the rich, when the banquet is ended, a ser­vant carries round to the several guests a coffin in which there is a wooden image of a corpse, carved and painted to resemble nature as nearly as possible, about a cubit or two in length [17 to 34 inches]. As he shows it to each guest in turn, the servant says, ‘Gaze here, and drink and be merry; for when you die, such will you be.’”Initially, mummification was the exclusive preserve of royalty and the court. During the period of the Old Kingdom (ca 2575-2130 B.C.), there was only one team of royal embalmers, who mummified members of the pharaoh’s family, courtiers, and officials to whom the monarch granted that privilege. Later, the ritual became more widespread, and independent workshops were set up. The “democratization” of mummies brought market realities into play, and levels of craftsmanship would vary widely depending on how much customers were able to pay.Even so, embalmers from all workshops were regarded as qualified professionals. Since they possessed anatomical knowledge and had to carry out a series of rituals, they were seen as both doctors and members of the priestly social class.Various papyri have been found that detail the different professionals involved in the process. One of the most notable was the “Lord of Secrets” (hery sesheta), who performed the rituals wearing a mask of Anubis, the god of embalming believed to have carried out the mummification of Osiris himself.There were also lector priests (hery heb), who read aloud the instructions for the ritual and magic spells as the dressings were applied. Meanwhile, the cutters removed the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines from the incision in the side of the corpse. Their social status was the lowest due to the impurity associated with the ritual.The embalmers performed their task during a long time phase between death and burial, which normally lasted over 70 days, although there are records of even longer periods. One account tells how the 4th-dynasty queen Meresankh III, wife of Pharaoh Khafre (the builder of the second of the great Pyramids at Giza), was not buried until 274 days after her death.Writing in the fifth century B.C., the Greek historian Herodotus observed how when the mourning period had ended, the body was given to the embalmers and “whenever a corpse was conveyed to them, they showed those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting.” Once a price had been agreed upon, the embalmer’s work would begin.Mummification was a complex and expensive procedure, in part because it required so many products. Although Egyptologists have not been able to identify all of these with complete certainty, here are the top eight essential ingredients to making the perfect mummy.1. NATRON AND OINTMENTS Natron was the main ingredient used to dry out the dead body, but embalmers applied oils such as cedar, and perhaps juniper oil, to maintain the suppleness of the flesh.2. RESIN The importance of resin was mentioned in the Admonitions of Ipuwer, a text from the Old Kingdom: “None shall sail northward to Byblos today; what shall we do for cedar trees for our mummies?”3. LICHEN AND ONIONS Onions were sometimes used to fill the body’s cavities, often serving as false eyes. Lichen has been found in the abdomens of Siptah and Ramses IV.4. SAWDUST, STRAW, SAND, AND RAGS... All of these materials were used to fill the body’s cavities during the 21st dynasty. Sawdust was also spread on the skin to aid the drying process.5. SPICES It has not been scientifically proven that spices were used in mummification. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus allude to cassia and cinnamon from India, Ceylon, and China.6. BEESWAX Wax has sometimes been found sealing the mouth, nasal passages, and other cavities in mummies from the New Kingdom and the Late Period. Bees were valued for their magical properties.7. INCENSE AND MYRRH Myrrh from Somalia and the south of Arabia was used to fill and anoint the body, and its fragrance was highly valued. Incense was used to fumigate the body, and in funerary rites.8. PALM WINE According to Herodotus, palm wine was used to clean bodily cavities, but so far no archaeological evidence has been found for this practice.The first stage was carried out quite quickly, since decomposition occurred rapidly in the intense Egyptian heat. The purification ritual for the deceased took place over three days in a temporary structure called an ibw, where the body was washed. Once the body had been purified, it was taken to the wabet (pure place) or per nefer (house of beauty), where the actual mummification began.According to Herodotus, the embalmers started their work by emptying the corpse’s head. The ancient Egyptians did not see the brain as the center of reason and identity, so they made no effort to preserve it. A long hook was inserted up the nose into the cranium and swirled around to liquefy the brain, which would then be poured out into a bowl.Next, the internal organs were removed through an incision, usually made in the left-hand side of the abdomen. But the heart, believed to be the center of wisdom, was deliberately left in place. Spells 27, 28, and 29 in the collection of mortuary texts known now as the Book of the Dead state the importance of keeping this organ connected to the body.Dehydration was essential to the embalming process. The material used was solid-state natron, a hydrated sodium carbonate often found near salt lakes. Immersed in this mixture for a period of 40 days, the body’s cavities filled with the substance and dried out from the inside. In an experiment performed on a corpse in 1994, Egyptologist Bob Brier and Dr. Ronald Wade found that 580 pounds of natron were needed to entirely cover and dry a body.Various oils and liquid resin were later rubbed into the flesh. This may have helped prevent or delay insect predation and mask the odors of decomposition. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt in the first century B.C. and observed the mummification process: “They carefully dress the whole body for over 30 days, first with cedar oil and certain other preparations, and then with myrrh, cinnamon, and such spices as have the faculty not only of preserving it for a long time but also of giving it a fragrant odor.”Once mummification was complete, the deceased would be carried to his or her final resting place. A large procession set out from the home. Servants and relatives car­ried offerings of food, flowers, and furniture. The chest bearing canopic jars containing the dead person’s internal organs was car­ried on one sled and a casket containing the mummy was pulled on another.After reaching the tomb, the procession was received by muu dancers, hired to per­form at funerals. The casket was placed up­ right before the tomb by a priest wearing the mask of Anubis. Before the burial began, a funerary priest addressed the corpse, as part of the solemn ritual known as the Opening of the Mouth: “Your mouth now works, I have opened your mouth for you, I have opened your eyes for you.”The key trait of the mummy is its linen wrappings, often the last step of mummification. This final procedure was carried out with great solemnity, the wrappers taking many days to entirely envelop the body. The amount of fabric used varied from one mummy to another and, in the case of less well-off clients, belonged to the deceased in their lifetimes. Every single action was defined in minute detail and accompanied by the appropriate spell. Amulets of various kinds were placed inside the folds of the linen to provide greater protection, as well as papyri with magic spells.If the deceased was a member of the elite, the mummy was covered with a mask and placed in a sumptuous casket, which was in turn placed inside a sarcophagus. A funerary procession carried the sarcophagus to the tomb, the “house of eternity,” where the body of the deceased, now properly fitted out for the rigors of the afterlife, could rejoin the elements of its soul and be born again.In the early 1880s, officials in Luxor suspected that mummies were being sold illegally, and following an investigation, they stumbled on a cache that shocked Egyptologists. In 1881, tipped off by a local dealer, the German archaeologist Emil Brugsch entered a cave set into a cliff face near Deir el Bahri. By the light of his candle he found the “many famous personages of whom we never expected to know more than their names,” including the remains of two of the most powerful New Kingdom pharaohs: Ramses II and Thutmose III, whose mummy was badly damaged by grave robbers. The mummies were later taken to Cairo where they were unwrapped before onlookers by Brugsch and other Egyptologists. The two great kings now rest in the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
"The mummy of King Tut, shown here, gets credit for popularizing the pharaoh's curse, but the myth's origin has been traced to a London stage act performed a hundred years before the boy king's tomb was excavated in 1922.Movie mummies are known for two things: fabulous riches and a nasty curse that brings treasure hunters to a bad end. But Hollywood didn't invent the curse concept.The "mummy's curse" first enjoyed worldwide acclaim after the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt.When Howard Carter opened a small hole to peer inside the tomb at treasures hidden for 3,000 years, he also unleashed a global passion for ancient Egypt.Tut's glittering treasures made great headlines—especially following the opening of the burial chamber on February 16, 1923—and so did sensationalistic accounts of the subsequent death of expedition sponsor Lord Carnarvon.In reality, Carnarvon died of blood poisoning, and only six of the 26 people present when the tomb was opened died within a decade. Carter, surely any curse's prime target, lived until 1939, almost 20 years after the tomb's opening.But while the pharaoh's curse may lack bite, it hasn't lost the ability to fascinate audiences—which may be how it originated in the first place.The late Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat conducted a comprehensive search and concluded that the concept began with a strange "striptease" in 19th-century London."My work shows quite clearly that the mummy's curse concept predates Carnarvon's Tutankhamen discovery and his death by a hundred years," Montserrat told the Independent (U.K.) in an interview some years before his own death.Montserrat believed that a lively stage show in which real Egyptian mummies were unwrapped inspired first one writer, and subsequently several others, to pen tales of mummy revenge.The thread was even picked up by Little Women author Louisa May Alcott in her nearly unknown volume Lost in a Pyramid; or, The Mummy's Curse."My research has not only confirmed that there is, of course, no ancient Egyptian origin of the mummy's curse concept, but, more importantly, it also reveals that it didn't originate in the 1923 press publicity about the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb either," Montserrat stressed to the Independent.But Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo and a National Geographic Society grantee, believes the curse concept did exist in ancient Egypt as part of a primitive security system.She notes that some mastaba (early non-pyramid tomb) walls in Giza and Saqqara were actually inscribed with "curses" meant to terrify those who would desecrate or rob the royal resting place."They tend to threaten desecrators with divine retribution by the council of the gods," Ikram said. "Or a death by crocodiles, or lions, or scorpions, or snakes."In recent years, some have suggested that the pharaoh's curse was biological in nature.Could sealed tombs house pathogens that can be dangerous or even deadly to those who open them after thousands of years—especially people like Lord Carnarvon with weakened immune systems?The mausoleums house not only the dead bodies of humans and animals but foods to provision them for the afterlife.Lab studies have shown some ancient mummies carried mold, including Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, which can cause congestion or bleeding in the lungs. Lung-assaulting bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus may also grow on tomb walls.These substances may make tombs sound dangerous, but scientists seem to agree that they are not.F. DeWolfe Miller, professor of epidemiology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, concurs with Howard Carter's original opinion: Given the local conditions, Lord Carnarvon was probably safer inside Tut's tomb than outside."Upper Egypt in the 1920s was hardly what you'd call sanitary," Miller said. "The idea that an underground tomb, after 3,000 years, would have some kind of bizarre microorganism in it that's going to kill somebody six weeks later and make it look exactly like [blood poisoning] is very hard to believe."In fact, Miller said, he knows of no archaeologist—or a single tourist, for that matter—who has experienced any afflictions caused by tomb toxins.But like the movie mummies who invoke the malediction, the legend of the mummy's curse seems destined never to die.",
"Seven men in Gemtasu's family look after him during the mummification process. Here, his body is repositioned over the fire. No one taking part in the ceremony is allowed to leave the area or wash.When Ulla Lohmann first met the Anga tribe in Papua New Guinea in 2003, the tribe's elders told her to leave. To even get there required a full day's drive, followed by a three-hour hike into the highlands on the west side of the island. After Lohmann, a German photographer and environmental scientist, made the trek, she was politely told that she wasn't welcome. The tribe wasn’t accustomed to visitors, and they didn't like their culture to be seen by outsiders.The reason they disliked guests was the same reason that initially attracted Lohmann to visit them: The Anga are known to mummify their dead. In an ancient ceremony, the members have a long history of converting the bodies of deceased relatives into mummified corpses that sit on a rock ledge near their villages. Such a high perch allows the mummies' families to feel as though their elders are watching over them.Lohmann retreated when she was asked, but not long after, she went back—and continued to return regularly over the course of a decade. Each time she made her case: She simply wanted to learn from the tribe, to see how its members lived and how they dealt with death.During her first few visits, she was granted incremental access to learn about the tribe's fragile structure. And after several more treks to the highlands, one of the tribe's elders, a man named Gemtasu, confided something to her: When he died, he wanted to be mummified.The Anga, a tribe of about 45,000 people, have a mummification process far different from the ancient Egyptians, who would dismantle the body from the inside, remove organs, and then wrap the body in a form of cloth. The Anga mummify their dead sitting up and subject them to three months of smoking over a constantly roaring fire (the smoking helps to preserve the corpse in a tropical culture where it would normally decompose quickly).The mummification method follows a strict structure. The body is suspended over a fire, and as it bloats, it is poked with wooden sticks to drain its fluids, and later, a stick is used to gently widen the anus to allow the organs to fall out. From start to finish, the mummifiers must remain with the body at all times, and no part of the dead—his fluids, his intestines, or even his body—is allowed to touch the ground, a taboo invitation for bad luck.Gemtasu with photographer Ulla LohmannThe most important part is to keep the face intact. In a culture without photography, the only way to preserve the image of the departed is to physically see their immortal faces. "We have pictures, they have mummies," Lohmann says. "The Anga believe that the spirits roam free during the day and return to their mummified bodies at night. Without seeing the face, the spirits cannot find their own body and would wander eternally."Mummification was once widespread in Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific islands, most prominent in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Finding a way to preserve physical bodies was seen as a way to keep them from being buried underground, where they could be easily forgotten. But the arrival of Christian missionaries and British and Australian government officers in the middle of the 20th century cast stigma on the practice, both for matters of morality and hygiene.Even so, Gemtasu, not knowing his exact age but feeling toward the end of his life, believed it was important to keep the tradition alive. Enduring as a mummy would allow him to protect his family. So he taught his grown children how to mummify. He demonstrated on a pig with the help of anthropologists Ronald Beckett and Andrew Nelson, who had studied the process. Gemtasu also asked Lohmann to photograph his own mummification and share his story.His sons, like many younger members of the tribe, at first resisted. The tribe has turned away from mummification, which is time consuming and labor intensive, to say nothing of the pungent smell of slow-smoked human flesh. The tribe has also experienced regular thinning as its younger members tend to be driven toward port cities more touched by globalization. But Gemtasu continued to urge his sons that mummification, at least for him, was important. “He hassled me long enough so I finally could not do anything else except promising him and making his wish come true,” says Awateng, one of Gemtasu’s son.And then, in 2015, Gemtasu died.In keeping with his dying wish, Lohmann returned to Papua New Guinea to witness and photograph the mummification. Seven men, including Gemtasu's grandson, began the process with white clay smeared on their faces, a sign of grief. Under the ceremonial rules, they were not permitted to drink any water—only sugar cane juice from bamboo—and could only eat food cooked in the fire that was smoking Gemtasu. When his skin burned, they used sticks to scrape off the top layer.As Lohmann observed over a series of weeks, the body swelled, blackened, and eventually hardened. The seven men performing the ritual smeared Gemtasu's body fluids onto themselves, an act to preserve his spirit. Under the strict rules, the men were not allowed to wash themselves for the entire three months of mummification, nor to leave the location.The purpose of mummification in cultures that perform it is usually the pursuit of eternal life, or at least of the continued physical presence for those who have died. In the Anga's case, the final stage is to carry the mummified body, strapped to a chair, to a rock cliff overlooking the village, where the newly deceased join a circle of slowly decomposing elders, their skeletons immortal reminders of the people who once lived.",
"Bog bodies are exquisitely preserved because of the lack of oxygen inside the bog, which prevents bacteria from decomposing skin. This body, known as Tollund Man, was found in Denmark.Polish scientists are launching what they say will be the world's largest scientific study of Egyptian mummies. The Warsaw-based project will examine 42 mummies, looking for clues to ancient diseases, the mummies' former occupations, and even whether the corpses were left-handed.Though Egypt's mummies are perhaps the most famous, cultures around the world have found creative ways to preserve their dead.Here are a few of world's mummies, including some you may not have heard of, and their strange path to pseudo-immortality.Ireland is known for its fairy tales of leprechauns and sprites, but it turns out there's something even stranger hiding out in the mists—bog bodies.Bodies thrown into the bogs of Ireland hundreds of years ago are preserved by this hostile environment. Bogs have very little oxygen, keeping the bacteria that eat dead bodies at bay and allowing bog bodies to be preserved for centuries. (See National Geographic's pictures of bog bodies.)One of the most recent of Ireland's bog bodies was discovered in 2011 and the oldest bog body on record at 4,000 years old, which is 500 years older than King Tutankhamen of Egypt.Though the bog can tell us about the lifestyle, diet and living conditions of a person, it also destroys DNA, so no one knows the bodies' exact lineages. Some scientists think that the Irish bog bodies were former kings, violently murdered and then tossed into the bog because they failed to protect their people from disease or famine. (For more theories on ancient bog bodies, check out "Who Were the Ancient Bog Mummies? Surprising New Clues.")Little did they know that their bodies would be preserved for millennia.Chile's Chinchorro mummies are the oldest known intentionally created mummies in the world. The Chinchorro were a fishing people living on the coast of what is now southern Peru and northern Chile about 9,000 years ago.The most famous Chinchorro cemetery is in Chile, nestled between the cities of Arica and Cobija, where the remains of what are known as the "Black Mummies" were hidden for millennia. Black Mummies were named for the layer of black manganese, a metal resembling iron, that coated their bodies.To create a Black Mummy, Chinchorro morticians cut off the body's head, arms and legs, scooped out the organs and flesh, and often emptied the brain through a hole in the skull. The skin was peeled away from the body and reattached later, like taking off and putting on a sock, according to a 1995 study published in the journal Latin American Antiquity. Morticians completed the process by shoving hot coals into the trunk cavity to dry the cadaver.Afterward, morticians rebuilt the body with sticks and animal hair, and covered it in white ash. As a final touch, morticians attached a crop of short black hair to the scalp, and painted the corpse black with manganese.The Chinchorro mummies are the oldest known artificially preserved dead, dating to thousands of years before Egyptian mummies.No one knows why the Chinchorro mummified their dead. It's possible they believed in an afterlife, or perhaps natural disasters such as earthquakes and El Niños pushed their people toward mortuary rituals and ancestor worship.Some villagers in Papua New Guinea still mummify their ancestors today.After death, bodies are placed in a hut and smoked until the skin and internal organs are desiccated. Then they're covered in red clay, which helps maintain their structural integrity, and placed in a jungle shrine.(Watch how it's done in "Lost Mummies of Papua New Guinea" on the National Geographic Channel.)Bodies are brought down from the shrine for celebrations, and loved ones visit the mummies to consult with their ancestors.A family carries an ancestor back to the cave above their village. In Papua New Guinea, mummified family members are often today a part of the community and are included in village celebrations.The first documentation on Papua New Guinea's mummies was by British explorer Charles Higgins in 1907. In the 1950s, traveling missionaries have discouraged the practice, but there are still villages where revered ancestors are smoked after their deaths.Some of our ancestors didn't want to rely on a mortician—they took matters into their own hands through self-mummification.The grueling and fatal practice was undertaken by Buddhist monks in Japan, China, and India. Some believed that the end result would give them special powers; others thought they'd one day awaken as if from a sleep. Monks hoping to attain self-mummification restricted themselves to a diet of nuts and seeds for about three years and then spent another three years eating only bark and roots. The goal was to deplete their bodies of all fat so, once they'd died, the bacteria that eat corpses would have less food.This diet was pioneered by the Great Master Buddhist Kûkai, who was said to have forsworn all cereal grains before self-mummifying himself in a stone cave, according to a 1962 article published in the journal History of Religions.Afterward, monks drank a poisonous tea, causing them to vomit repeatedly so they'd lose their remaining bodily fluids. The lack of water in their bodies and poison flowing through their veins would, again, make it more difficult for bacteria to decompose the body after death.When the end was near, the monks moved to a tomb, equipped with only an air tube and a bell. These devout men meditated, ringing the bell each day to tell those on the outside they were still alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the air supply was cut off, and the tomb was sealed.Despite all that work, not all attempts at self-mummification were successful. In fact, it appears that most monks failed, and their bodies decomposed.Today, self-mummification is discouraged by Buddhist religious leaders, but it's a practice that has existed since at least the 12th century, and scientists are still finding more of these mummies mummies; there are at least 24 known. In 2015, a self-mummified Buddhist monk was discovered entombed in a Buddha statue in China.The Egyptian mummies, snug in their pyramids, protected by "curses" are infamous in the worlds of both fact and fiction.The Egyptian embalming process was so successful that we’re still learning from the ancient, mummified corpses.Celebrated by researchers for offering a window into the past and sensationalized by Hollywood, embalmed Egyptian corpses are the créme de la créme of mummies.Egyptians were embalmed during a process that often lasted 70 days. Priests liquified the corpse's brain and drained it through their nose. All internal organs were removed and placed in separate jars, except the heart, which was left intact because ancient Egyptians believed the heart was integral to a person's being and intelligence.Afterward, the body was dried with natron, a type of salt, and wrapped in hundreds of yards of linen. Now completely mummified, the body was placed inside its tomb along with paintings or models of food and amulets—all things the person would need in the afterlife."The Egyptians believed that the mummified body was the home for this soul or spirit. If the body was destroyed, the spirit might be lost," according to the Smithsonian website.This type of mummification was so successful that now, thousands of years later, we're still learning from the bodies of long-dead Egyptians.And the search for more mummies isn't over. Even now, scientists are exploring King Tut's tomb, where clues suggest there may be a door to a second, hidden tomb. Archaeologist Nicholas Reeves believes the tomb could contain the remains of Tut's mother-in-law, the famed Nefertiti.(Read more in "Could Queen Nefertiti's Tomb Reveal Secrets From Egypt's Shadowy Past?")",
"The 1830 artwork "Liberty Leading the People" was created by renowned French painter Eugene Delacroix. The artist is known to have used pigment made from ground mummy.Eugene Delacroix's most famous painting, "Liberty Leading the People," hangs in a revered spot in Paris' Louvre Museum. Inspired by the 1830 Paris Uprising, it has been held up as an embodiment of the French national ethos, and most recently as a justification for the country's controversial burkini ban.But "Liberty Leading the People" may also have been literally painted with people.From at least the 16th century until as late as the early 1900s, a pigment made from mummified human remains appeared on the palettes of European artists, including Delacroix. Painters prized "mummy brown" for its rich, transparent shade. As a result, an unknown number of ancient Egyptians are spending their afterlife on art canvases, unwittingly admired in museum galleries around the world.The use of mummy as a pigment most likely stemmed from an even more unusual use—as medicine. From the early medieval period, Europeans were ingesting and applying preparations of mummy to cure everything from epilepsy to stomach ailments. It's unclear whether Egyptian mummies were prized for the mistaken belief that they contained bitumen (the Arabic word for the sticky organic substance, which was also believed to have medicinal value, is mumiya), or whether Europeans believed that the preserved remains contained otherworldly powers.What is clear to researchers is that early artist pigments were derived from medicines at the time, and were commonly sold alongside them in European apothecaries. And just as mummy was waning in popularity as a medical treatment, Napoleon's invasion of Egypt at the end of the 18th century unleashed a new wave of Egyptomania across the Continent.Tourists brought entire mummies home to display in their living rooms, and mummy unwrapping parties became popular. Despite prohibitions against their removal, boatloads of mummies—both human and animal—were brought over from Egypt to serve as fuel for steam engines and fertilizer for crops, and as art supplies.A 1937 view of the British Museum's mummy room. It's possible that mummy remains may also be present in the museum's painting galleries.By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the supply of quality mummies for pigment appears to have dried up. A 1904 ad in the Daily Mail requests one "at a suitable price," adding: "Surely a 2,000-year-old mummy of an Egyptian monarch may be used for adorning a noble fresco in Westminster Hall…without giving offence to the ghost of the departed gentlemen or his descendants."Nonetheless, many artists may have been unaware that mummy brown was a pigment actually made from mummies. "You just wouldn't expect that to happen," says Gary Bowles, a representative of C Roberson and Co. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Roberson was one of Europe's preeminent "colorists," supplying paints and pigments to everyone from the artists of the UK's Royal Gallery to amateurs like Winston Churchill.Until 1933, Roberson's featured mummy brown in their artist's catalog, and Bowles recalls seeing mummy parts in the shop as late as the 1980s, when the company was bought out. "There's no more mummy brown around," he confirms.In one unusual anecdote about the pigment, the writer Rudyard Kipling describes a day in the 1860s spent with two pre-Raphaelite painters, Edward Burne Jones, Kipling's uncle, and Lawrence Alma Tadema. After Alma Tadema informed his colleague that mummy brown was indeed made from mummies, a horrified Burne Jones retrieved his tube of mummy from his studio and buried it in the yard. "[H]e descended in broad daylight with a tube of 'Mummy Brown' in his hand, saying that he had discovered it was made of dead Pharaohs and we must bury it accordingly," Kipling recalls.A drawing of Edward Burne Jones at work. The artist allegedly buried his tube of mummy brown once he was told that it actually contained mummy."Alma Tadema was an important customer at Roberson at the time they were grinding up mummies in the mid-nineteenth century," says Sally Woodcock, a painting conservator and researcher at the Roberson Archive of the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum. "It's quite possible that he had seen it being prepared."Woodcock notes that many of the pre-Raphaelite artists who purchased mummy brown from Roberson, such as Alma Tadema, painted Egyptian scenes. "It would be quite interesting to see if these artists were using mummies to paint mummies," she adds.But while we know that mummy brown was a pigment sold by shops and purchased by artists, it's almost impossible to scientifically determine what specific paintings may feature the pigment, even through the use of mass spectrometry.The few recipes that exist for making mummy brown vary wildly, with some calling for the use of the whole body and others using "only the finest muscle." In addition, the techniques for mummification changed over the centuries, with different resins, oils and plants used at different time, notes Alan Phenix, scientist and head of Treatment Studies research at the Getty Conservation Institute."The things that might have been used in embalming and wrapping, such as mastic resin, are all used by artists as varnishes, vehicles, or additives, so to say that something is associated with [mummy brown] is extraordinarily difficult," says Barbara Berrie, head of scientific research at the National Gallery of Art. "The characteristic molecules that would let you know it was of mammalian origin would likely be present in very small quantities."While the use of embalmed Egyptians as paint pigment has long been out of vogue, art suppliers are still selling tubes of paint called "mummy.""I'm sure people don't really understand why the name would be mummy, that it actually refers to the original source for the colorant," Berrie observes. "But I don't think they're using real mummies anymore. I hope not!"",
"A hush fell on the group of British and Egyptian observers standing at the sealed doorway on November 26, 1922. Three weeks earlier, British archaeologist Howard Carter and his team had stumbled on a rubble-filled stairway in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt.Following the excavations of the late 1800s, many archaeologists thought the valley had yielded all its secrets. However, Carter had a hunch that there was still more to find. Egyptians began to bury their royalty in the Valley of the Kings during the New Kingdom (circa 1539-1075 B.C.). Carter was searching for the tomb of an obscure king from the 18th dynasty. The boy king has since become Egypt’s most famous pharaoh, but when Carter was digging, his name—Tutankhamun—was only spoken in scholarly circles.Having cleared the debris from the stairs, Carter’s team revealed the top of a doorway, sealed with plaster. Upon it were the undisturbed seals of the royal necropolis, a sight that made Carter’s heart race with excitement. After ordering the staircase filled in, Carter sent a cable to his patron—the wealthy Lord Carnarvon—that said: “At last have made wonderful discovery in valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact.”Carnarvon hurried to Egypt to witness the opening of the tomb. As Carter and his team re-cleared the staircase to continue their work, the entire door was exposed, and the seals of Tutankhamun revealed. Carter’s hunch was right. He had found the boy king. The door also bore signs of damage and repair, leading Carter to wonder if the tomb was indeed intact.The next day, the team assembled to open the tomb. With Carnarvon and other observers looking on, Carter drilled a small hole in the top corner of the doorway and placed a candle inside. The candle flickered, and Carter peered in. As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness beyond, he heard Carnarvon asking: “Can you see anything?”“Yes,” Carter replied. “Wonderful things. Wonderful things!”Tutankhamun reigned for only nine years, and his short reign may be what kept grave robbers from the contents of his tomb. Born around 1342 B.C., Tut descended from two important kings: Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV, the latter better known as Akhenaten. Amenhotep III ruled Egypt for nearly four decades at the height of the 18th dynasty, while Akhenaten radically reshaped Egyptian religion and art by discarding the old gods and devoting Egypt to one deity, Aten, the sun disk. His 17-year reign was marked by highly stylized artworks that prominently featured this symbol.After Akhenaten’s death, the young Tutankhamun became king. Egypt dismantled the legacy of his father, returning to the old religious and artistic traditions as well as smashing his monuments and statues. The boy king’s reign was short, just under a decade. At age 15 or 16, he died under mysterious circumstances and was hastily entombed with all the pomp and splendor befitting a king.Because of his link to Akhenaten, Tut’s reign was eventually struck from the record by his successors. By attempting to write him out of history, they inadvertently preserved his legacy. Because thieves did not know his name, they were unlikely to look for his tomb. Because Tut’s tomb was intact, his name will live forever.Carter’s glimpse of Tutankhamun’s grave goods that day was a rare reward in a life marked by setbacks and financial difficulties. Born the youn-gest of 11 siblings in London in 1874, Howard Carter was the son of a respected but not terribly wealthy painter. Brought up by his aunts, Carter later wrote that a weak constitution “debarred me from public-school [the British term for private school] life and games”—a statement now believed to be a half truth. He was certainly a sickly child, but it is likely that Carter did not, in fact, receive much in the way of formal schooling.Even so, following in his father’s footsteps, Howard showed a natural talent for drawing and painting. Thanks to family connections, at age 17 he was recommended to Percy Newberry, a renowned Egyptologist who was looking for an artist for an archaeological expedition to Egypt. After an apprenticeship of three months at the British Museum, Carter set off for the Nile, where he was employed on a major excavation in Akhetaten (Amarna), the city built by Akhenaten.Exposure to Egyptian monuments changed Carter’s professional life, as he turned from art to archaeology. His career took off: He became an inspector with the Egyptian Department of Antiquities and eventually rose to become chief inspector for northern Egypt. By the early 1900s he was working for American archaeology enthusiast Theodore M. Davis in the Valley of the Kings. Named in hieroglyphs as “The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health in the West of Thebes,” the Valley of the Kings was known in ancient Egypt as the Great Field. It was regarded (incorrectly it seems) as ideal for royal interments because its remoteness was thought to deter grave robbers.In 1904 Carter’s archaeology career almost ended. A group of drunken tourists at the necropolis of Saqqara caused a disturbance, and Carter ordered them to leave. They complained to their ambassador, who demanded an apology from Carter. He refused and was forced to resign. At age 31, with no job and no money, Carter had to leave archaeology behind; he eked out a living by painting watercolors for tourists.The year before the Saqqara incident, George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, the wealthy fifth Earl of Carnarvon, had taken up residence in a Cairo hotel. A collector of racing cars and horses, Lord Carnarvon had been seriously injured in a car accident in Germany. He moved from Highclere Castle in southern England (the setting for the popular period drama Downton Abbey) in the hopes that Egypt’s arid climate would help him recover. Quickly growing bored with Cairo life, he took an interest in archaeology. He made inquiries, and Carter was recommended to him. In 1907 their partnership began.When Carter and Carnarvon joined forces, the concession to dig in the valley was held by Theodore Davis. Davis’s work had uncovered several artifacts that intrigued Carter. In a stash of embalming material in the valley, Davis found linen and other items bearing the name of Tutankhamun. Carter saw these as indications that Tutankhamun’s tomb could be nearby. Davis was certain that there was nothing more to be found, so he gave up the concession. Carter and Carnarvon quickly snapped it up.Unfortunately, the excavation permit was awarded in 1914, and the outbreak of World War I disrupted exploration, although Carter did manage to explore the tomb of Amenhotep III, Tutankhamun’s grandfather, in 1915. It was not until December 1917 that he was able to resume work and finally search for the resting place of the boy king. Carter employed a systematic method he had developed during his many years in the field: a meticulous division of the site into a grid.For years Carter and his team scoured the rocky landscape, scarred with the trenches of previous digs. Discoveries were thin on the ground. In 1922 a frustrated Carnarvon informed Carter he would not continue to finance the work. Carter pleaded with him to reconsider; moved by his passion, Carnarvon agreed to fund one last season. On November 1, 1922, Carter resumed digging in the Valley of the Kings. On November 4, they found the stairway that led to the unopened tomb of Tutankhamun.Carter described his first glimpse some years later: “Details of the room emerged slowly from the mist. . . strange animals, statues and gold—everywhere, the glint of gold.” The room Carter saw is now known as the antechamber. By early the next year its contents had been logged and removed, leaving just two statues guarding the door to another area, which Carter had a hunch must be the burial chamber.That door was opened in February 1923, and the room was found to be entirely taken up with three nested shrines. Deep inside these lay a series of gold sarcophagi, at the heart of which lay the mummy of King Tut wearing his golden funerary mask. Abutting the burial chamber was another, smaller room, which became known as the Treasury. Containing the most precious of Tutankhamun’s royal possessions, it had successfully eluded grave robbers for an astonishing 3,000 years.Carnarvon died a few months after the discovery, from an infected mosquito bite. But Carter would survive to complete his work. He continued with the task of inventorying the myriad contents of the tomb, completing his work in 1932. He spent his final years preparing the results for publication, and died in London in 1939, age 64. Carter’s perseverance and good fortune uncovered a little-known pharaoh and made him a phenomenon.",
"The tughra (insignia) of the 16th-century Ottoman emperor Süleiman the Magnificent. A tughra generally includes the name of the sultan and his father along with the phrase "the eternally victorious."Known as one of history’s most powerful empires, the Ottoman Empire grew from a Turkish stronghold in Anatolia into a vast state that at its peak reached as far north as Vienna, Austria, as far east as the Persian Gulf, as far west as Algeria, and as far south as Yemen. The empire’s success lay in its centralized structure as much as its territory: Control of some of the world’s most lucrative trade routes led to vast wealth, while its impeccably organized military system led to military might. But all empires that rise must fall, and six centuries after the Ottoman Empire emerged on the battlefields of Anatolia, it fell apart catastrophically in the theater of World War I.A 16th-century portrait of Osman, the first sultan of the Ottoman Empire.Osman I, a leader of a nomadic Turkic tribe from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), began conquering the region in the late 13th century by launching raids against the weakening Christian Byzantine Empire. Around 1299, he declared himself supreme leader of Asia Minor, and his successors expanded farther and farther into Byzantine territory with the help of foreign mercenaries.In 1453, Osman’s descendants, now known as the Ottomans, finally brought the Byzantine Empire to its knees when they captured the seemingly unconquerable city of Constantinople. The city named for Constantine, the first Christian emperor of Rome, then also became known as Istanbul (a version of stin polis, Greek for “in the city” or “to the city.”Now a dynastic empire with Istanbul as its capital, the Ottoman Empire continued to expand across the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa. Though it was a dynasty, only one role—that of the supreme ruler, or sultan—was hereditary. The rest of the Ottoman Empire’s elite had to earn their positions regardless of birth.This 16th-century miniature painting depicts the army of Süleiman the Magnificent marching into Europe.Under the reign of Süleiman the Magnificent, whose 16th-century lifetime represented the peak of the Ottomans’ power and influence, the arts flourished, technology and architecture reached new heights, and the empire generally enjoyed peace, religious tolerance, and economic and political stability. But the imperial court left casualties behind, too: female slaves forced into sexual slavery as concubines; male slaves expected to provide military and domestic labor; and brothers of sultans, many of whom were killed or, later, imprisoned to protect the sultan from political challenges.At its height, the Ottoman Empire was a real player in European politics and was home to more Christians than Muslims. But in the 17th century, it began to lose its stronghold. Until then, there had always been new territory to conquer and new lands to exploit, but after the empire failed to conquer Vienna for a second time in 1683, it began to weaken.Political intrigue within the sultanate, strengthening of European powers, economic competition because of new trade routes, and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution all destabilized the once peerless empire. By the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was derisively called the “sick man of Europe” for its dwindling territory, economic decline, and increasing dependence on the rest of Europe.It would take a world war to end the Ottoman Empire for good. Already weakened beyond recognition, Sultan Abdul Hamid II briefly flirted with the idea of constitutional monarchy before changing course in the late 1870s. In 1908, the reform-minded Young Turks staged a full-fledged revolt and restored the constitution.The Young Turks who now ruled the Ottoman Empire wanted to strengthen it, spooking its Balkan neighbors. The Balkan Wars that followed resulted in the loss of 33 percent of the empire’s remaining territory and up to 20 percent of its population.As World War I loomed, the Ottoman Empire entered into a secret alliance with Germany. The war that followed was disastrous. More than two thirds of the Ottoman military became casualties during World War I, and up to 3 million civilians died. Among them were around 1.5 million Armenians who were wiped out in massacres and in death marches during their expulsion from Ottoman territory. In 1922, Turkish nationalists abolished the sultanate, bringing an end to what was once of history’s most successful empires.",
"This sculpture of Roman Emperor Constantine was created by the Baroque artist Bernini. The ruler is depicted here as awed by the vision of a cross presaging victory of an important battle in 312 A.D.Emperor Constantine (ca A.D. 280– 337) reigned over a major transition in the Roman Empire—and much more. His acceptance of Christianity and his establishment of an eastern capital city, which would later bear his name, mark his rule as a significant pivot point between ancient history and the Middle Ages.The Roman Empire that Constantine was born into was one of chaos and anarchy. Civil wars, invasions, and disease were rending the empire so badly that the era is regarded as the Crisis of the Third Century. Emperor Diocletian tried to bring order by distributing power to a four-ruler tetrarchy that would govern the four quarters of the empire. Constantine’s father, Constantius I, was one of the rulers.Diocletian’s plan fell apart. After the death of his father in A.D. 306, Constantine was declared emperor by his father’s soldiers. He spent the next 18 years battling the three other Roman rulers—his rivals—to become the sole emperor.The Battle of Milvian Bridge outside Rome in A.D. 312 was a watershed moment for Constantine. He defeated one rival, his brother-in-law Maxentius, and gained the mantle of western Roman emperor. But of far greater import was a revelation he experienced before the battle.According to Constantine’s biographer Eusebius, Constantine and his forces saw a cross of light in the sky, along with the Greek words for “In this sign conquer.” That night, Constantine had a dream in which Christ reinforced the message. The emperor marked the Christian symbol of the cross on his soldiers’ shields. When he triumphed at Milvian Bridge, he attributed the victory to the god of the Christians. Modern scholars still debate the tale and whether Constantine’s conversion was sincere or a political maneuver. Regardless, in A.D. 313 Constantine met with Licinius, the eastern emperor, and together they issued the Edict of Milan. The edict granted “to the Christians and others full authority to observe that religion which each preferred.”Christianity emerged in the far reaches of the Roman Empire sometime around A.D. 26 or 27, when Jesus of Nazareth began his public ministry. Attracting large crowds throughout his native Galilee (in modern-day Israel), he preached a message of forgiveness, love, and renewal. He talked about fulfilling the Scriptures but stopped short of openly declaring himself the “Messiah,” the savior of the Jewish nation prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. Jesus was arrested on charges of blasphemy and crucified around A.D. 30. The Bible tells that Jesus rose from the dead three days after his Crucifixion. His followers called him “the Christ,” or the “anointed one,” and referred to themselves as Christians. They began to spread the Gospel, the “good tale,” of his life and ministry.Constantine assumed sole control over the empire in A.D. 324. Rome, however, was losing its luster for him. Tensions remained high between the city’s pagans and the Christian emperor. Moreover, from a military standpoint, Constantine realized it would be easier to fend off threats from the east and to protect valuable territory—and granaries—in Egypt if he moved his capital to a more defensible eastern location. He left Rome for good to build an imperial city that would glorify both his power and his faith.Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), his capital, was dedicated in A.D. 330. Previously known as Byzantium, it had been under Roman control for well over a century, but Constantine rebuilt and expanded it on a monumental scale. He tripled the size of the existing city and offered full citizenship and free bread to encourage men of rank to move there with their families. A large palace and imposing legislative halls established the city’s gravitas as the new capital. Churches began to punctuate the skyline; Christians were welcomed, and other faiths were generally tolerated.The ascendant Constantinople soon eclipsed Rome. The western empire gradually crumbled until Rome’s fall in A.D. 476. Yet Constantine’s capital—and the Christian foundation he laid there for the empire—continued to thrive for nearly a thousand years.By the time Constantine established his new capital in A.D. 330, the city that would be called Constantinople had changed hands multiple times among regional superpowers. Darius I of Persia, the Delian League, the Spartans, and Alexander the Great all had ruled the strategic port known as Byzantium on the Bosporus, a strait between the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara. Roman emperor Septimius Severus destroyed the city in A.D. 196 and rebuilt a grander version, which Constantine expanded upon for his New Rome. The city became a prosperous and important center of faith, power, trade, and architecture. The landmark Hagia Sophia (above) was built by Emperor Justinian during the sixth century, the peak of Constantinople’s glory.",
"I wake to find myself in Diocletian’s living room. A little odd, considering Diocletian lived 1700 years ago. But the Roman emperor’s palace is actually one of history’s great recycling success stories—not to mention one of the world’s great archaeological sites. Let me explain.Diocletian retired to his point of origin, Split, Croatia, at the turn of the fourth century A.D., with plans to raise cabbages and enjoy the Adriatic way of life. In true imperial style, he had built a city-size complex with all the amenities—including a ceremonial entrance court, Egyptian sphinxes, and a temple devoted to Jupiter. But after the fall of the Roman Empire in the late fifth century, the palace withered beneath the Mediterranean sun.Some time later, people fearful of warring barbarians began residing within its crumbling walls, building their own houses in which to live. Crafty minds quickly spotted the Roman leftovers—marble columns and slabs and arches—that could be put to use as tables, windows, support pillars, and more.The result? Gothic and Renaissance buildings incorporating the Roman remnants into their relatively “modern” styles, all within the palace’s original walls.But it doesn’t stop there. More recently, that hodgepodge of ancient structures has been repurposed yet again to become today’s trendy cafés, bars, and boutiques—a hub of neon and bustling crowds and window-shopping delights.Indeed, in this still-living city, 3,000 people reside along the walled complex’s pedestrian-only streets paved with Roman marble.In the grocery store, I shop for fruit among ancient pillars.Waiting in line at the bank, I lean against a Corinthian column.And so today, I wake in the Hotel Vestibul Palace, an über-chic space that incorporates some of what remains of Diocletian’s living room. Several walls, for instance, sport exposed brick- and stonework from his imperial residence; the Roman herringbone pattern is unmistakable.At noon, I peek outside my little window, which looks down on the palace’s rounded vestibule, and I see Diocletian and his wife, dressed in long flowing robes and flanked by their honor guard of Roman soldiers, processing in the elaborate changing of the guard.It’s obviously a reenactment, but amid the regalia the crowd cheers and, for a very brief moment, I cheer along, worried that the emperor might take notice if I don’t. Back in the day, such a lack of enthusiasm would have been seen as disloyal, even grounds for execution.But then I remember, I’m in 21st-century Split, where the Roman legacy lives on—everywhere I look.Barbara A.

"Visitors explore Rome’s famous Colosseum.The Appian Way Regional Park is a protected area of around 3,400 hectares, linking the center of Rome to the Alban Hills. One of the earliest and most important of the ancient Roman roads, the Appian Way boasts impressive pine forests, tombs, and monuments commissioned by the emperors as well as the Park of the Aqueducts. An ideal spot for a bike ride.The Roman Forums and the Sacred Way is where one of the most advanced societies man has ever witnessed began. The ancient Roman senate and religious buildings stand alongside incredible freshly restored highlights, such as the House of Augustus and the House of Livia on the Palatine Hill and the recently cleaned Colosseum, all available with a single archaeological ticket.The entire historical center of Rome is UNESCO-certified. The holy site of St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican City was consecrated in 1626 and is the largest church in Christendom, built by Donato Bramante, Carlo Maderno, Michelangelo, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It contains Michelangelo's magnificent 136-meter-high dome, his "Pieta" statue, the sacred ancient burial ground and tomb of St. Peter, and capacity for 60,000 people.Whether you are Catholic or not, attending the weekly ritual in St Peter's Square at the Vatican City is an interesting cultural experience. See the Pope, the local crowds, and the famous Swiss Guards. The event is free every Wednesday at 10 a.m. Tickets to guarantee a seat can be obtained from the Swiss Guards.Visit Ostia Antica, and have the ruins all to yourself. Located 30 kilometers southwest of Rome, it is bigger than Pompeii and allows visitors to enter a world of bakeries housing 1,800-year-old mills made of volcanic stone, fishmongers, and restaurants dating back 2,000 years. Standing eerily empty but well preserved, and a short train ride away, it is very much worth the effort and has its own museum, too.Villa Maxentius is one of the most beautiful Roman ruins to visit. Once the plush mansion of the Emperor Maxentius, it boasts three major ruins: the palace, the circus, and a mausoleum. It is a green oasis in the center of Rome on the Appian Way, and best of all, it is completely free. Take a picnic!The Pantheon is unmissable. The best-preserved ancient Roman temple in the world, and the largest concrete dome in the world at 43 meters in diameter, it dominates the Roman skyline. Go early to see the light bursting through the oculus or in the evening to watch the guards closing the doors. Better still, go when the red rose petals are dropped through the oculus every year for Pentecost.Palazzo Valentini is the next best thing to a time machine, transporting visitors 7 meters beneath street level to see the ruins of two lavishly decorated ancient Roman houses. The houses were discovered beneath a Renaissance palace, which has been the base of the provincial and prefectural administration of Rome since 1873. With original marble floors, bathrooms, and mosaics, it's a true look at the lives of Roman nobility.Monti's bistros and boutiques are tucked behind the wings of archaeological sites like the Trajan Markets and Nero's Domus Aurea palace. Wine bars, vintage markets, and postcard-worthy buildings and balconies await you after a morning of walking around Rome's main sites.Everywhere in Rome is good for people-watching but especially Piazza del Fico in the evening to watch the locals playing chess and smoking cigars or the Borromini Terrace overlooking Piazza Navona.",
"Snow softens a gorge in northern Armenia that people call Jardi Dzor, “massacre canyon,” where Turkish forces are said to have shot some 4,000 Armenians in 1920.One million Armenians—some say more, some say less—were killed a century ago in the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor of modern Turkey.A stone cenotaph in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, commemorates this tragic event: the Medz Yeghern, or “great catastrophe,” of the Armenian people. Each spring—on April 24, when the pogroms started—many thousands of pilgrims climb an urban hill to this shrine. They file past an eternal flame, the symbol of undying memory, to lay a small mountain of cut flowers. Just 60 miles to the northwest, and a few hundred yards across the Turkish border, lie the ruins of an older and perhaps more fitting monument to the bitterness of the Armenian experience: Ani.What is Ani? Ani was the medieval capital of a powerful, ethnically Armenian kingdom centered in eastern Anatolia—the sprawling Asiatic peninsula that today makes up most of Turkey—and straddling the northern branches of the Silk Road. It was a rich metropolis that hummed with 100,000 souls. Its bazaars overflowed with furs, with spices, with precious metals. A high wall of pale stone protected it. Renowned as the “city of 1,001 churches,” Ani rivaled the glory of Constantinople. It represented the flowering of Armenian culture. Today it crumbles atop a remote, sun-hammered plateau—a scattering of broken cathedrals and empty streets amid yellow grasses, a desolate and windblown ruin. I have walked to it. I am walking across the world. I am retracing, on foot, the pathways of the first ancestors who abandoned Africa to wander the world. I have seen no place on my journey more beautiful or sadder than Ani.“They don’t even mention the Armenians,” marvels Murat Yazar, my Kurdish walking guide.And it is true: On the Turkish government placards erected for tourists, the builders of Ani go unnamed. This is intentional. There are no Armenians left in Ani. Not even in official histories. So just as Tsitsernakaberd hill in Yerevan calls to remember, Ani is a monument to forgetting.Last year the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the world’s oldest Christian communities, made saints of all the victims of the genocide of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire, the sprawling and multiethnic state that gave rise to modern Turkey. A veiled woman attends the canonization ceremony in Ejmiatsin, Armenia.On April 24, 2015, the hundredth anniversary of the beginning of a mass slaughter that many historians label the first genocide of the modern era, crowds join a torchlight procession through the Armenian capital of Yerevan to honor the dead. During the annual commemoration, part somber memorial and part nationalist rally, the grieving can turn overtly political—participants sometimes burn Turkish flags.One of the oldest and most intractable political disputes in the world—a toxic standoff that has locked Armenia and Turkey in acrimony, in enmity, in nationalist extremism for generations—can be reduced to the endless parsing of three syllables: genocide. This word is freighted with alternative meanings, with shadings, with controversy. It is codified by the United Nations as one of the worst of crimes: the attempt to obliterate entire peoples or ethnic, racial, or religious groups. And yet when does it apply? How many must be slaughtered? How to weigh action versus intent? By what ghastly accounting?The Armenian version of events: The year is 1915. World War I is nine months old. Europe is herding its young into the fires. The vast and multicultural Ottoman Empire—the world’s most powerful Muslim polity—has allied itself with Germany. A large Christian Armenian minority, once so peaceful and trusted as to be labeled by the sultans as the millet-i sadıka, or loyal nation, is wrongfully accused of rebellion, of siding with the Russian enemy. Some Ottoman leaders decide to resolve this “Armenian problem” through extermination and deportation. Soldiers and local Kurdish militias shoot Armenian men. There are mass rapes of women. Armenian villages and city neighborhoods are looted, appropriated. The dead clog the rivers and wells. Cities stink of rot. The survivors—ragged columns of women and children—straggle at bayonet point into the waterless deserts of neighboring Syria. (Today just three million Armenians live in Armenia; eight to ten million are scattered in diaspora.) The Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire drops from about two million to fewer than 500,000. Most historians call this subtraction the modern world’s first true genocide.The sturdy friendship between the Armenian Christian family of Nuran Taş (second from left) and the family of Nizamettin Çim, a Kurdish Muslim (center rear), whose grandfather helped shelter the Taşes from intolerance, offers a counterpoint to a history of ethnic tension in eastern Turkey, where the Armenian population was mostly killed or expelled during World War I. The Armenian and Turkish governments have yet to kindle such trust and amity.Qaghtsrik Petrosyan, 76, video chats from Zovasar, Armenia, with her son and a younger relative, who live in Russia. Many Armenian men work abroad, especially in Russia, because of historical links to the old Soviet Union and because of Armenia’s anemic economy.“I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this,” wrote Henry Morgenthau, Sr., the U.S. ambassador to Constantinople at the time. “The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared with the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.”Turkish authorities categorically deny this account. Their version of the “so-called genocide” goes like this: It is a time of supreme madness in history, a time of civil war. Armenians suffer, it is true. But so do many other groups trapped inside the Ottoman Empire as it splinters during the Great War: ethnic Greeks, Syriac Christians, Yazidis, Jews—even the Turks themselves. Blood flows in all directions. There is no systematic extermination plan. And the Armenian death tolls are exaggerated, fewer than 600,000. Moreover, many Armenians are in fact traitors: Thousands join the armed ranks of invading coreligionists, the imperial Russian Army.Challenging this official view still carries risks in Turkey. Though prosecutions have eased, Turkish judges deem the term “genocide” provocative, incendiary, insulting to the nation. When speaking of the Armenian calamity, even such luminaries as Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish novelist and Nobel Prize winner, have faced charges of denigrating Turkishness or the Turkish state.“It is our hope and belief,” then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared in a carefully worded speech in 2014, “that the peoples of an ancient and unique geography, who share similar customs and manners, will be able to talk to each other about the past with maturity and to remember together their losses in a decent manner.”What is the special power of this word “genocide”?The Armenian diaspora has spent decades funding lobbying campaigns to urge the governments of the world to deploy this term when describing what occurred under the Ottomans. In Diyarbakır, a Kurdish city in eastern Turkey, I am conducting an interview at a newly reopened Armenian church—a small, fragile gesture of Turkish-Armenian conciliation—when a man strides up to me.“Do you recognize the genocide?” he demands. He is Armenian. He is agitated. He peers into my eyes.I am startled. I’m working, I tell him.“I don’t care,” he says. “Do you or don’t you recognize the genocide?”I put down my pen. He repeats his question, over and over. He is telling me: I am not a ghost.Nektar Alatuzyan, 102, was a year old when the massacres and deportations of Armenians began in Turkey. Her family, rescued from a coastal mountain in southern Turkey by a French warship, escaped to Egypt; in 1947 she, her husband, and their children settled in Armenia. The last eyewitnesses of what Armenians call Medz Yeghern—the “great catastrophe”—are deemed living treasures in Armenia. A dwindling few remain to tell their families’ stories.The question of memory: Never forget. But of course we do. Eventually we always forget.“People have been making war for thousands of years,” observed the Polish journalist and writer Ryszard Kapuściński, “but each time it is as if it is the first war ever waged, as if everyone has started from scratch.”In a town outside of Yerevan a shrunken old man slumps on a couch. His name is Khosrov Frangyan. He is bundled against the nonexistent cold—in blankets, in a pile jacket, in a knit cap, with socks pulled over his gnarled hands—because his heart and veins are antique. He is 105 years old. He is one of the last living survivors of the Armenian massacres. These frail elders, now mostly gone, are cherished as national heroes in Armenia. Because they are the last palpable links to the crime of 1915. Because they are a breathing rebuke to denial. They have repeated their stories so many times that their delivery seems dry, remote, rote—worn as smooth as well-rubbed coins.“I was five when the Turks came,” Frangyan rasps. “They chased us up the mountain.”He recounts his story in shards. It is a fabled incident from the genocide. Some 4,700 residents of six Armenian villages in what is now southern Turkey fled up a coastal mountain called Musa Dağ. They rolled rocks down on their Turkish pursuers. They held out for more than 40 days. The desperate survivors waved a handmade banner at ships steaming past along the Mediterranean shore. “CHRISTIANS IN DISTRESS—RESCUE.” By some miracle French warships saved them and carried them off to Egypt, to exile.Frangyan’s brown eyes are watery and red rimmed. He does not dwell, as some Armenian witnesses do, on the horrors, on the summary executions of parents in front yards, on mass rapes, on decapitations. No. His voice rises as he recalls instead the fruits of his lost village: “The gardens! My grandfather had figs—each tree was 50 meters high! I want to eat those bananas now! I want to keep the memory of those bananas!” Frangyan’s middle-aged daughter shakes her head. She apologizes. The old man gets confused, she says. But he is not confused. I have been to his homeland in Hatay Province, Turkey. I have stood near his old village amid orchards lush with tangerines and lemons. It is indeed a subtropical paradise. And I have peered from a hilltop overlooking the same blue sea where the warships dropped anchor. His chance salvation reminded me, unreassuringly, of the conclusion to that novel of human evil Lord of the Flies: How adults finally splashed ashore on a remote island of innocent, castaway children—children who had devolved, unsupervised, into murderers—to save the day.Mount Ararat, a powerful symbol of Armenian identity, looms over children at play in eastern Turkey. Redrawn borders after World War I left it inside Turkey, to the dismay of Armenians. Today Ararat is a fixture of Yerevan’s southern skyline—seemingly so close, yet locked beyond a border shut by controversy, pain, and history.A century ago the French Navy rescued Frangyan and his family. But who will save the French sailors from human darkness? And who will rescue the rest of us?I walk out of Africa. I follow the footsteps of our Stone Age ancestors. Wherever these pioneers appeared, other resident hominins disappeared. They vanished.In eastern Turkey I walk by derelict Armenian farmhouses. Trees sprout from their rubble, their roofless rooms. I walk past old Armenian churches converted to mosques. I sit in the mottled shade of walnut orchards planted by the long-ago victims of death marches.“We fought the Armenians, and many died,” says Saleh Emre, the gruff, white-haired mayor of the Kurdish village of Taşkale. He suddenly softens. “I think this was wrong. They belonged here.”The archways of the crumbling Surp (Saint) Garabed Church in Çüngüş, eastern Turkey, hint at the former heights of Armenian culture here. Many old churches have fallen to ruins or been converted into mosques in the former Armenian heartland. But grassroots attempts at reconciliation, often led by Turkey’s minority Kurds, have also helped rebuild one of the largest Armenian churches in the Middle East, in the city of Diyarbakır.Muslim Kurds occupy a strange place in the violent history of eastern Turkey. From a frontier gendarmerie who did the Ottomans’ dirty work a century ago, they have become a besieged ethnic minority, demanding more political rights in modern Turkey. Victimhood now binds many Kurds to their long-departed Armenian neighbors.Emre says his family acquired the land for his village from Armenians. It came very cheap. He lets this fact sink in. He ticks off the names of nearby towns that once were majority Armenian: Van, Patnos, Ağrı. Few or no Armenians live in them now.When does a genocide officially end? At which point is the act of mass annihilation complete—finished, documented, resolved? Surely not when the gunfire stops. (This is far too soon.) Is it when the individual dead disappear from the chain of human memory? Or when the last emptied village acquires a new population, a new language, a new name? Or is it sealed, at long last, with the onset of regret?My guide, Murat Yazar, and I inch northward. We trek across yellowing steppes where wolves run before us, pausing to gaze back over their shoulders in silence, then trot on. We pass Mount Ararat. The 16,854-foot peak shines to the east, smeared white with snow. The Bible links the mountain to Noah’s high-altitude anchorage. The beautiful volcano is sacred to the Armenians. (A popular misconception has it that Armenian Apostolic priests even wear caps shaped like Ararat’s cone.) In August 1834 the Russian meteorologist Kozma Spassky-Avtonomov climbed to the mountain’s icy summit. Ararat towers so high that he thought he might see stars twinkling during the daytime. His expedition was the perfect Anatolian quest: He was trying to discern what is always there yet invisible. This is a landscape haunted by absences.A hopeful union in a land of clashing histories: Adem Yalmaz, 25, and his wife, Seher Demirel, 18, break for lunch during their wedding in a village near Kars, Turkey. Yalmaz is Azeri, and Demirel is Kurdish; theirs is a rare marriage between often mistrustful ethnic groups. Many of the old homes in their village used to belong to Armenians.“Chosen trauma” is how the political psychologist Vamık Volkan describes an ideology—a worldview—by which grief becomes a core of identity. It applies to entire nations as well as individuals. Chosen trauma unifies societies brutalized by mass violence. But it also can stoke an inward-looking nationalism.I slog across the Lesser Caucasus Mountains from Turkey into the republic of Georgia. I throw stones to knock frozen apples from bare trees. Pausing in Tbilisi, I ride a night train to Yerevan. It is April 24, the hundredth anniversary of the Armenian genocide.Billboards festoon the Armenian capital. One shows weapons—a scimitar, a rifle, a hatchet, a noose—arrayed to spell out “1915.” Another bluntly pairs an Ottoman fez and “Turkish” handlebar mustache with Adolf Hitler’s brush mustache and comb-over. The least combative symbol of mourning is the most poignant: forget-me-not flowers. Millions of violet petals brighten Yerevan’s parks and medians. The corollas are reproduced on banners, on stickers, on lapel pins: a blossom of genocide. “I remember and demand”—this is the slogan of the commemoration.But demand what?This is the key question that Armenians are asking themselves. Is the past a guide? Or is it a trap?Apostolic Bishop Mikael Ajapahian, of the Armenian city of Gyumri: “In Armenia there is no enmity toward Turkey. We hold nothing against ordinary Turks. But Turkey must do everything—everything—to heal the wounds.”Elvira Meliksetyan, women’s rights activist: “We don’t know what we want. If everything reminds us of our past burdens, then we lose the future, no? We have no strategy. All this victimization makes us beggars.”Ruben Vardanyan, billionaire philanthropist: “A hundred years later we are the winners. We survived. We are strong. So saying thank you, giving back something to the people who saved us, including Turks, is the next step. A hundred years ago some of their grandparents saved our grandparents. We need to connect those stories.” (Vardanyan has funded an award, the Aurora Prize, to honor unsung heroes who rescue others from genocide.)Local people say the chasm in eastern Turkey known as Duden (previous) was a mass grave for Armenians pushed to their deaths during the ethnic cleansing in World War I. Here, the ruins of a hilltop Armenian church mark the site of an old Armenian village in far eastern Turkey, now home to ethnic Kurds. Though their ancestors participated in the mass killings and deportation of Armenians a century ago, many Kurds today long for reconciliation.There is a torchlight march. There are photo exhibits. There is a concert by an Armenian-diaspora rock band from Los Angeles. (“This is not a rock-and-roll concert! To our murderers, this is revenge!”) The Tsitsernakaberd with its eternal flame—the hilltop monument to the dead—is crowded with diplomats, academics, activists, ordinary people. At a genocide-prevention conference, an American historian dryly lays out the case for Turkish reparations. It is “not an absurd or immaterial proposition,” he suggests, for Turkey to cede the six traditionally Armenian provinces of the Ottomans to Armenia. (Germany has paid more than $70 billion in compensation to the victims of Nazi atrocities.)The most wrenching story I hear on my Armenia side trip comes from a young man with eyes like open manholes.“I was just a baby, maybe one year old. I was dying in the hospital. I had pneumonia—I think it was pneumonia. The doctors could do nothing. A Turkish woman in the maternity ward noticed my mother crying. She asked my mother if she could hold me. She unbuttoned her dress. She took me by my ankles and lowered me down the front of her body. It was like she was giving birth to me all over again. She did this seven times. She said prayers. She shouted, ‘Let this child live!’ ”And?“I got better.” He shrugs. “The Turk saved my life.”Ara Kemalyan, an ethnic Armenian soldier, tells me that story inside a frontline trench about 150 miles southeast of Yerevan. There are pocks of distant gunfire. A dusty white sun. Rusty cans hang on barbed wire—a primitive alarm system against infiltrators. For more than 20 of his 38 years Kemalyan, a fighter from the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, has been squared off against soldiers—his former friends and neighbors—from the central government of Azerbaijan, a secular Muslim state. Up to 30,000 people, mostly civilians on both sides, have died in the violence over Nagorno-Karabakh since the late 1980s, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. This poisonous little war, paralyzing the Caucasus, has virtually nothing to do with the older violence under the Ottomans. Yet Kemalyan still dubs the woman in the hospital, the Azerbaijani midwife who saved him with magic, an enemy “Turk.” The specters of 1915 have occupied his heart.Pastoralists in southeastern Turkey push sheep into pastures that have known the calls of Kurdish, Armenian, Arab, and Turkish shepherds. The Ottoman Empire, a patchwork of ethnicities and once a great cultural entrepôt, combusted during World War I in the flames of ultranationalism. Today tens of thousands of Armenians live openly in Turkey—a tiny number compared with the three million in Armenia and the estimated eight to ten million in the global diaspora.Before walking out of these ghost lands, I revisit Ani. The medieval ruin in Turkey. The monument to denial. This time I see it from the Armenian side of the frontier.The closed Armenia-Turkey border is one of the strangest boundaries in the world. Turkey shut its land crossings in 1993 out of sympathy with Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. The Armenian side also remains sealed, owing in part to pressure from the diaspora against normalizing relations with Turkey. The result: Roads traversing a storied intersection of the globe—a fulcrum point between Asia and Europe—go nowhere. A train station on the Armenian side has not seen a locomotive pass in 22 years. A sleepy clerk sweeps the station office once a day while the rails silently rot. (A ghost airline does fly direct between Armenia and Turkey; it operates from a nondescript office in Yerevan.) As a result, the economies of both countries suffer. People on both sides of the line are cut off, isolated, poorer.The Russian Army guards the Armenian side of the border with Turkey as part of a mutual-defense pact. This is how Moscow maintains influence in the strategic region. The sight is surreal: Strands of Armenian barbed wire, Russian watchtowers, and checkpoints face open fields in Turkey, which demilitarized its side of the border many years ago. Russian and Armenian troops face off against Turkish shepherds. The shepherds wave.“I always keep my kitchen fire lit,” says Vahandukht Vardanyan, a rosy-cheeked Armenian woman whose farmhouse sits across the barbed wire from Ani. “I want to show the Turks that we’re still here.”I climb an overlook by her home where Armenian pilgrims disembark from buses. These tourists come to gaze longingly across a fence at their ancient capital in Anatolia. I look too. I see exactly where I stood months earlier in Turkey. A ghost of my earlier self roams those ruins. Nothing separates any of us except an immense gulf of loneliness.Picnicking at night beneath apricot trees—and a giant cross shining defiantly into Turkey—villagers in the border town of Bagaran, Armenia, belt out songs of memory, cultural endurance, and survival. The bitter dispute between Armenia and Turkey dating back four generations has paralyzed economic, diplomatic, and political progress in the region. The ancient crossroads between Turkey’s eastern highlands and the Caucasus remains in the thrall of ghosts.",
"In a tomb deep below the desert, Egyptologist Ramadan Hussein (left) and mummy specialist Salima Ikram (right) examine the coffin of a woman who was laid to rest inside a limestone sarcophagus weighing more than seven tons.The discovery made headlines around the world when it was first announced in July 2018: Archaeologists had unearthed an ancient Egyptian “funeral home” deep beneath the sands of Saqqara, a sprawling necropolis—city of the dead—located on the banks of the Nile less than 20 miles south of Cairo.In the two years since, thorough analysis of the finds and new discoveries in a nearby shaft filled with tombs have yielded a trove of information about the business of death in ancient Egypt. For centuries, archaeology in the land of the pharaohs was focused on uncovering inscriptions and artifacts from royal tombs rather than the details of day-to-day life. Mummification workshops probably existed at necropolises all over Egypt, but many were overlooked by generations of excavators rushing to get to the tombs underneath.Now, with the discoveries at Saqqara, that’s changing as the archaeological evidence for a vast funeral industry is unearthed and documented in detail for the first time.Painted plaster decorates the wooden coffin of a woman named Tadihor. Hieroglyphs on the plaster form a spell from the Book of the Dead to help the deceased navigate past demons guarding the underworld.More than 2,500 years of heat and humidity have taken their toll on a badly decomposed mummy, but dozens of beads and other clues indicate this was an elite individual.A priest named Ayput was interred in a stone sarcophagus carved in the shape of a human, a style known as anthropoid. The mummy’s wrapping were coated with tar or resin, giving it a dark color.“The evidence we uncovered shows the embalmers had very good business sense,” says Ramadan Hussein, an Egyptologist based at the University of Tübingen in Germany. “They were very smart about providing alternatives.”Couldn’t afford a deluxe burial mask crafted with gold and silver? You might be offered the “white plaster and gold foil” deal instead, Hussein says.Not enough cash to store your innards in jars of lustrous Egyptian alabaster? How about a nice painted clay set instead?“We’ve been reading about this in the [ancient] texts,” Hussein says, “but now we can really contextualize the business of death.”Hussein began working at Saqqara in 2016, searching for tombs dating to around 600 B.C. and hidden deep underground. The deep shafts had been largely ignored by earlier Egyptologists, who often focused on burials from older periods in Egyptian history. His team’s work is profiled in a new, four-part National Geographic series, Kingdom of the Mummies, which premiers in the U.S. Tuesday May 12. While probing an area last examined in the late 1800s, Hussein and his team discovered a shaft carved into the bedrock that was filled with sand and debris.Workers use a hand-cranked winch to lower tools and other gear to the mummy workshop and tombs 100 feet below. The burial complex occupied a prime location at Saqqara—within sight of the Step Pyramid of Djoser, one of Egypt’s oldest and most sacred monuments.After removing 42 tons of fill, the archaeologists arrived at the bottom of the 40-foot shaft and found a roomy, high-ceilinged chamber. It, too, was choked with sand and boulders that had to be removed. Among the rubble were thousands of broken pieces of pottery, each of which had to be carefully documented and conserved. The painstaking excavation took months.When at last the chamber was empty, the team was surprised to discover that it wasn’t a tomb. The room had a raised, table-like area and shallow channels cut into the bedrock along the base of one wall. In one corner, a barrel-sized bowl was filled with charcoal, ash, and dark sand. An older tunnel—part of a network of passages that honeycomb the rock beneath Saqqara—moved cool air through the space.To reach the mummy workshop and burial chambers, archaeologists had to remove 42 tons of sand and debris from this 100-foot vertical shaft carved out of the sandstone bedrock.The clues suggested to Hussein that the chamber had been a mummification workshop, complete with an industrial-strength incense burner, drainage channels to funnel blood, and a natural ventilation system.“If you’re doing evisceration down there, you need air moving in to get rid of insects,” Hussein says. “You want constant movement of air when you’re dealing with cadavers.”Over the past year, pottery experts were able to piece together the ceramic sherds, reconstructing hundreds of small bowls and jars, each one inscribed with a label.“Every single cup or bowl has the name of the substance it held, and the days of the embalming procedure it was used,” Hussein says. “Instructions are written directly on the objects.” (Related: Archaeologists uncover an embalming recipe some 5,600 years old.)The discovery has been a boon for scholars who study ancient Egyptian burial practices, offering a unique look at the sacred rites—and gritty realities—of mummification.Ramadan Hussein peers inside a stone sarcophagus in search of mummies. The team discovered more than 50.While there’s ample documentation of the elaborate process in ancient sources, and even artistic depictions on the walls of Egyptian tombs, archaeological evidence has been hard to come by.“Very few workshops devoted to the process have been properly excavated,” says Dietrich Raue, curator of the University of Leipzig’s Egyptian Museum. “That leads to a big gap in our knowledge.”The discoveries at Saqqara are helping fill that void, says Hussein. “For the first time, we can talk about the archaeology of embalming.”To ancient Egyptians, who believed the body had to remain intact to house the soul during the afterlife, embalming was a mixture of holy rite and medical procedure. The process was a carefully orchestrated ritual, with specific rites and prayers performed on each of the 70 days it took to turn a dead person into a mummy.First the internal organs were removed and placed in containers archaeologists call canopic jars. Next the body was dried using special salts such as natron. Then the deceased was anointed with fragrant oils and wrapped in linens. Amulets and spells were then tucked between the folds of cloth. At last the mummy was laid to rest in a tomb furnished with provisions for the afterlife as fancy as one could afford.With little room to maneuver in a claustrophobic burial chamber, workers use steel jacks and clever engineering to lift the five-ton lid of a massive sarcophagus.The towering pyramids of the pharaohs and the glittering gold from King Tutankhamun’s tomb are familiar reminders of the lengths the richest Egyptians went to to ensure they would spend eternity in style. “It was a huge industry,” Hussein says.But a mummy’s journey didn’t end with embalming and burial—and neither did the income stream. In addition to serving as priests and undertakers, ancient Egyptian embalmers were real-estate salesmen, too.While pharaohs and the Egyptian elite were mummified and laid to rest in elaborately decorated coffins and roomy tombs packed with grave goods, Hussein’s research shows that ancient undertakers offered discount packages to suit every budget. In today’s business jargon, they were vertically integrated, providing everything from evisceration of corpses and burials to the care and maintenance of the souls of the deceased—all for a fee, of course.Just a few steps from the mummification workshop at Saqqara, the archaeologists uncovered a second shaft leading to a complex of six tombs. Inside those half-dozen tombs were more than 50 mummies.Archaeologists Maysa Rabeeh (left) and Mohammed Refaat (right) examine the degraded wooden coffin of a priest named Ayawet who was interred with crossed arms—a divine position usually reserved only for pharaohs.At the bottom of the shaft—almost 100 feet beneath the surface, where spaces were more expensive because of their proximity to the underworld—the burials were especially elaborate and expensive. They included a woman laid to rest inside a limestone sarcophagus weighing seven and a half tons. In a nearby chamber was a woman whose face was covered with a mask made of silver and gold. It was the first such mask found in Egypt in more than half a century.But the complex also held middle-class or working-class Egyptians interred in simple wooden coffins, or just wrapped in linen and placed in sand pits.Using three-dimensional mapping tools, Hussein has been able to piece together how the burials were arranged. His findings confirm papyrus documents recovered from Saqqara more than a century ago suggesting that enterprising embalmers packed dozens of bodies into the burial shaft, then collected fees or exchanged parcels of land in return for the spiritual upkeep of each mummy. (Learn how cultures around the world have mummified their dead.)A digital model created by a 3D scanner reveals the main shaft leading down to a complex of burial chambers. The most prestigious tombs were located in the deepest part, closest to the underworld.Ancient Egyptian society included an entire class of priests dedicated to caring for the spirits of the dead. Their job description included maintaining tombs and praying for their departed owners. Some owned dozens of tombs, with hundreds of mummies packed into each one.“People had to bring weekly offerings to the dead to keep them alive,” says Koen Donker van Heel, an Egyptologist at the University of Leiden who has spent years studying the legal contracts priests signed with the families of the dead. “Dead people are money. That’s basically it.”For the first time, archaeological evidence is confirming what until now has only been guessed at based on inscriptions and millennia-old legal documents. Insights like that make the Saqqara excavation special. It’s part of a shift in Egyptology: Researchers are looking harder at details that illuminate the lives of everyday Egyptians, rather than focus on the fanciest tombs.“Ramadan is getting a lot of information that was simply lost in the past,” says Raue, the Leipzig curator. “There was a whole infrastructure above ground that was simply removed without documentation.”Paleoradiologist Sahar Saleem (between two male technicians) uses a mobile x-ray unit to reveal secrets hidden beneath the wrappings of the mummified priest Ayput. The name is male, but the size and shape of the mummy's pelvis, as well as the roundness of its skull, suggests to Saleem that this priest might actually have been a priestess.That means the future could hold more such discoveries for excavators patient enough to look. While poring over old dig reports, Hussein realized the shaft leading to the mummification workshop was located less than three feet from where French and Egyptian excavators stopped searching in 1899. The chamber and its contents were hidden by the sand they hastily shoveled aside.“Perhaps we need to go back to the sites that were explored in the 1800s and early 1900s,” Hussein says, “and excavate them again.”",
"An Egyptian team, including head worker Mustafa Abdo, uncovered this finely decorated tomb of a priest.During Egypt’s pyramid age, a well-connected man named Wahtye died and was laid to rest in the vast royal cemetery that now occupies the desert west of modern Cairo. His colorfully decorated tomb, apparently intact, has recently come to light some 16 feet (five meters) beneath the sand at the archaeological site known as Saqqara. (Learn more about Egypt's great pyramids.)This burial is “one of a kind in the last decades,” said Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, at a press conference that announced the discovery earlier today. "The color is almost intact even though the tomb is almost 4,400 years old."The tomb owner served King Neferirkare, who ruled during the Old Kingdom’s fifth dynasty. In addition to the name of the deceased, hieroglyphs carved into the stone above the tomb’s door reveal his titles: royal purification priest, royal supervisor, and inspector of the sacred boat."What we have is a rock-cut tomb-chapel," explained Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, in an email. "What has been revealed so far is the 'public' part of the complex, where family, friends, and priests could come and leave offerings for the dead." Dodson was not part of this project.The grave’s rectangular gallery—measuring 33 feet (10 meters) wide north to south, 10 feet (three meters) east to west, and about ten feet tall—is covered in painted reliefs, sculptures, and inscriptions, all in remarkably good shape after so many centuries.The reliefs depict Wahtye himself, his wife, Weret Ptah, and his mother, Merit Meen, as well as everyday scenes that include hunting, sailing, making offerings, and manufacturing goods such as pottery and funerary furniture. Large painted statues of the priest and his family fill 18 niches, while 26 smaller niches near the floor hold statues of an as yet unidentified person either standing or seated with legs crossed, as a scribe.The number and variety of the statues is unusual, said Dodson, adding that "the rest of the decoration is made up of scenes intended to magically recreate the environment in the next world, in particular the production of food to sustain the dead for eternity, and their receipt of offerings."The team of Egyptian archaeologists working here found five shafts in the tomb. One was open and held nothing inside, but the others are sealed—a situation that offers exciting possibilities. Work on the sealed shafts could begin as early as tomorrow, according to news reports.“This shaft should lead to a coffin or a sarcophagus of the owner of the tomb,” said Waziri, indicating his best guess for the location of finds to come. Other shafts might hold the grave goods of the deceased.The high priest’s tomb lies along a ridge that has been only partly excavated. Even more discoveries may turn up when digging resumes there in January.",
"Amelia Blanford Edwards was one of a stream of European travelers drawn to see the wonders of Egypt at the close of the 19th century. In her 1877 book, A Thousand Miles Up the Nile, she writes of the hot drive to the edge of the desert, until “the Great Pyramid, in all its unexpected bulk and majesty, towers close above one’s head ... The effect is as sudden as it is overwhelming. It shuts out the sky and the horizon. It shuts out all the other Pyramids. It shuts out everything but the sense of awe and wonder.”Most modern travelers would probably reach for similar words to pinpoint the sublime thrill of seeing the Pyramids at Giza in person today. They are so iconic, so astonishingly ancient, that it is hard to imagine that 4,600 years ago the plateau where they stand was a desolate, dune-covered wilderness where a scattering of tombs lay under the burning Egyptian sun. Along with the enigmatic Sphinx and other smaller tombs and monuments, Giza has three principal pyramids: Khufu (originally 481 feet high, and sometimes called Cheops, or the Great Pyramid); Khafre (471 feet); and Menkaure (213 feet). Emerging out of the complex dynastic needs of Egypt’s 4th dynasty, they are the triumphant product of one of the most daring and innovative engineering projects the world has ever known.The kings of the 4th dynasty ruled Egypt from around 2575 to 2465 B.C. Presiding over the golden age of the Old Kingdom, their center of power was the sophisticated Nile-side city of Memphis, about 15 miles south of Giza. The dynasty’s second king, Khufu, ruled during a period of relative peace in Egypt, although the Greek historian Herodotus later depicted him and his son as cruel and proud.Khufu’s architects and engineers embarked on a project that transcends any other structure in the Bronze Age. Its completion utterly transformed the plateau. Khufu had selected it, in part, to distance himself from the magnificent pyramids built by his father, Snefru, in Dahshur, another necropolis near Memphis. Several other factors also made it an ideal site. The high plateau allowed greater visibility for the pyramid. It was near Heliopolis, basis of the cult of the sun god Re. Since there were already some tombs in Giza, the land had already been sanctified and so was fit for a pharaoh’s tomb of a stature never seen before, or surpassed since.After Khufu’s death, his son Redjedef ruled for a short time and began work on a tomb in Abu Ruwaysh that was never finished. The next pharaoh, his brother Khafre, built a pyramid—as well as the Great Sphinx, some scholars claim—in Giza. The next generation followed the same pattern: Baufre, son of Redjedef, built his tomb outside of Giza, while Menkaure, Khafre’s son, built his in Giza.Each pharaoh who built in Giza did so in accordance with some simple rules that harmoniously ordered the three funerary complexes on the plateau: the facade of Khafre’s high temple is aligned with the western face of Khufu’s pyramid. And the facade of Menkaure’s high temple is aligned with the western face of Khafre’s pyramid. At the same time, the imaginary line that roughly joins the southeast corners of the three pyramids points toward the temple of Re in Heliopolis.circa 2550 B.C. Khufu, second king of Egypt’s 4th dynasty, begins work on his pyramid. When complete, the massive tomb will measure 481 feet high, the biggest pyramid ever.circa 2530 B.C.Redjedef, Khufu’s son, holds power for only a few years. He commissions a pyramid north of Giza at Abu Ruwaysh, but the structure is never finished.circa 2520 B.C.Khafre, another son of Khufu, commissions the second pyramid at Giza. Although it is slightly smaller than Khufu’s, it sits on higher ground, making it look taller.circa 2490 B.C.Menkaure, after succeeding his father, places his pyramid next to Khafre’s and his grandfather’s. The contents of all three tombs will be looted.Herodotus claimed that construction of the Great Pyramid—today calculated at over six million tons of stone—was carried out using slave labor. It is now known this building was undertaken, in fact, by paid Egyptian laborers. The notion that Egyptian monuments were built by slaves—such as the plight of the Hebrew slaves recounted in the biblical book of Exodus—seems to have had currency in the ancient world.Such colossal building projects would have left some kind of archaeological trace, and so it was amid huge excitement that in 1999 archaeologists started to uncover the village housing of the workmen who built the two later pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure. This followed the discovery of the workers’ cemetery in 1990, which was divided into upper and lower parts according to the rank of the deceased.Imhotep was one of the leading minds of the 3rd dynasty, not only because he was the architect of the first pyramid to be built, the Saqqara step pyramid, but because he held senior positions in all areas of Egyptian society: religious, political, economic, and artistic. He also built the pyramid of Djoser’s successor, Sekhemkhet. He was later deified as the god of medicine throughout Egypt in the Late Period.Both village and cemetery offer archaeologists a mine of valuable data about the conditions in which the two smaller pyramids of Giza were built—data that, in turn, gives a working hypothesis as to the construction of the pyramid of Khufu. A study of workers’ bones shows that the work was backbreaking—sometimes literally. Yet these laborers, far from being slaves, were privileged civil servants, and beneficiaries of a number of enviable perks.Analyses show they enjoyed a protein-rich diet, practically unheard of among the rest of the Nile Valley’s inhabitants. Evidence that broken limbs and fractures had been set correctly strongly suggests adequate medical care was provided. One of the skeletons in the cemetery had a leg amputated so precisely that experts estimate that the patient lived for some 20 years after the operation. The discovery of the workers’ village has also enabled archaeologists to debunk another of Herodotus’s somewhat fanciful claims: that 100,000 people built Khufu’s pyramid. In fact, the village seems to have had a maximum capacity of 20,000 people, of whom perhaps half were dedicated to construction at any one time.The daunting challenges of building such a structure, and efficiently marshaling thousands of workers, required meticulous planning. Scribes set about calculating the number of blocks that would be required to build a pyramid with the selected gradient—in the case of Khufu, the angle of the sides with the ground is 52 degrees—the kind of mathematical problem recorded in Egyptian mathematical papyri, and at which Egyptian civil servants excelled.Graffiti and inscriptions at the site have also enabled scholars to piece together telling facts about life on this colossal construction site. Blocks found with dates from all seasons in the Egyptian calendar suggest the pyramids were built year-round and not just when the Nile was in flood.It is not known who designed the Great Pyramid, but the man responsible for supervising its complex construction was Hemiunu, Khufu’s nephew, a senior civil servant who acted as the pharaoh’s vizier. Despite the mystery surrounding Giza, Hemiunu himself was a flesh-and-blood man, as shown by his decidedly lifelike—and fleshy—statue, found in his tomb in Giza’s west cemetery.There are many types of pyramids and not all were built in the same way. The lowest stones in Egypt’s first ever pyramid—Djoser’s step pyramid in Saqqara, built the century before Khufu’s—are bricks. But as construction progressed, and engineers became more confident, they used larger blocks. The largest at Giza, weighing three tons, were those used to build Khafre’s pyramid.Much of the stonework in the Giza Pyramids came from a quarry barely half a mile to the south of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. The white limestone that once formed the outer casing had a longer journey to Giza, moved by boat along the Nile from Tura, eight miles away. When he was working in Karnak in the 1930s, the scholar Henri Chevrier discovered that a five-ton block can be dragged horizontally along a wet clay track by just six men. As pictures found in tombs have shown, blocks of that size were also sometimes pulled by oxen. The ramps by which they were raised onto the pyramid structure have also been depicted on the decoration of some tombs, and there is archaeological evidence for such ramps at Giza itself.The geometry of a pyramid helped overcome the logistical problem of raising massive stones: As much as 40 percent of a pyramid’s volume is concentrated in its bottom third. The raising of stone blocks by means of a ramp beyond the lower third of the structure was, however, a major challenge, and it is still not fully known how the Egyptians solved the problem. One solution would have been to use the building’s inner step structure—visible today, since the outer casing stones have long disappeared—because then the blocks would only have had to be raised a little at a time, in the same way a heavy object can be eased up a staircase.The rows making up Khufu’s pyramid are slightly more than two feet high on average. So it is highly likely that, given sufficient manpower, levers could be used to raise large blocks into position—and so on, until the construction reached completion in the form of the pinnacle, known as the pyramidion, which historians believe was put in place in the course of a solemn ceremony.The pyramidion atop Khufu has long been toppled, but is thought to have been of white Tura stone. It capped a total of two and a half million stone blocks, making it one of the most massive buildings on the planet, the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing.He ordered the building of one of the biggest monuments in the world, one which bears his name 4,500 years after he ruled. His name appears on documents and on the few reliefs that remain on the entrance path to his funerary complex. Yet until a few years ago, there was only one tiny representation of Khufu, the man who built the Great Pyramid of Giza: an ivory carving just three inches high (above), an artifact considered—in a supremely ironic twist—as the smallest piece of Egyptian royal sculpture ever discovered.Recently, however, some specialists have suggested that a pair of limestone and granite stone heads from the Old Kingdom might be portraits of Khufu—a theory contested by other historians. Yet another hypothesis may give Khufu the biggest boost of all: According to Giza expert Rainer Stadelmann, the face of the Great Sphinx at Giza is not Khafre—as some scholars have argued—but Khufu himself, in divine form, protecting his pyramid.",
"Researchers long thought the prehistoric mummies of Egypt were created by accident. But mounting evidence suggests people had a hand in preserving these ancient dead.The mummy lays delicately curled in the fetal position. Though it now rests in a museum in Turin, Italy, it assumed its vulnerable pose thousands of years ago in Egypt, baked in the searing sands near the banks of the Nile.Dating to some 5,600 years ago, the prehistoric mummy at first seemed to have been created by chance, roasted to a decay-resistant crisp in the desert. But new evidence suggests that the Turin mummy was no accident—and now researchers have assembled a detailed recipe for its embalmment.The ingredient list represents the earliest known Egyptian embalming salve, predating the peak mummification in the region by some 2,500 years. But this early recipe is remarkably similar to the later embalming salves used in extensive rituals to help nobles like King Tut pass into the afterlife.“It's really interesting to see those connections,” says Stuart Tyson Smith, an archaeologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not part of the study team. “It gives us a nice piece of the puzzle that we didn't have before.”The study, published today in the Journal of Archaeological Science, comes after decades of meticulous work with prehistoric mummies. Study coauthor Jana Jones, an Egyptologist at Macquarie University, got her first hints of this early mummification in the 1990s, when she was studying ancient mummy wrappings that date to roughly 6,600 years ago.Jones peered at the wrappings under a microscope and was astounded: The cloths appeared to contain remnants of an embalming resin, a compound commonly seen in later mummies. “It was just an incredible feeling,” she says.But microscopic evidence wasn't enough to say Egyptians embalmed their dead thousands of years earlier than previously thought. That required careful chemistry, and it took Jones and her team 10 years to complete the analysis. “That was just the curse of the mummy,” she quips. The team finally confirmed the find on the wrappings in 2014, publishing those results in PLOS ONE.“That was the ground-breaking moment,” says Stephen Buckley, an archaeological chemist and expert in mummification who led the chemical analysis for both the 2014 study and this latest work.But some experts remained skeptical, Jones says. The researchers lacked evidence from an actual mummy, since the textiles had long been separated from their preserved owner. So they turned to the Turin mummy for more clues.The Turin mummy—or “Fred” as he is often affectionately called—has been housed in Turin's Egyptian Museum since the early 1900s, and he had remained untouched by modern preservatives and unstudied by scientists.The researchers subjected samples from the mummy to a battery of tests, teasing out the precise chemical components of the ancient embalming recipe. They found that the salve had a base of plant oils that was then mixed with plant gum or sugars, heated conifer resin, and aromatic plant extracts. The latter pair of ingredients are particularly important, since they stave off microbial growth.The components of the paste not only resemble those used thousands of years later in Egypt, but they also bear a striking similarity to the chemistry of the salve researchers had identified in the prehistoric mummy wrappings.“It's confirming our previous research, undoubtedly,” says Jones.Ancient Egypt’s most famous pharaoh was the offspring of a union between siblings. Inbreeding may have afflicted him with a congenital clubfoot and even prevented him from producing an heir with his wife, who was probably his half sister.With their commonly curled positions and organs still inside their shriveled bodies, prehistoric mummies are a far cry from the classic entombed mummies that come to mind when you think of Egypt. But the basic idea behind an embalming salve remained the same.The balm would have formed “sort of a sticky brown paste,” Jones says. Bandages were either dipped before wrapping, or the embalmer would directly smear the paste on the body. The mummy was then positioned in the hot sand so that a combination of the searing sun and balm preservatives would keep the body safe.Later “classic” mummies were more often laid flat and interred in tombs far from the sun's rays. Because of this, Buckley says, the embalmers had to take additional measures, such as removing the brain and other organs, as well as desiccating the body with a type of salt called natron.The study also suggests that early embalming practices were much more widely spread than once thought. The wrappings analyzed in the earlier study hail from a part of Egypt that's over a hundred miles north of where the Turin mummy was likely preserved.So how did ancient Egyptians figure out the recipe so long ago?“Some of these ingredients may well have had a symbolic significance initially,” Buckley speculates. “But then they noticed that they had a preservative benefit.” The team is now studying sites of early experimentation with embalming ingredients, says Buckley, hinting at a future publication.Ronn Wade, retired director of the anatomical services division of the University Maryland, praised the new study for its thoroughness. In 1994, Wade replicated the Egyptian mummification process on a modern human with support from a National Geographic grant.“I wish we had some of this information when we were doing our mummy,” he says. “That would have been interesting.”",
"In 1842, the German Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius transformed understanding of Egyptian spirituality after he published a collection of ancient mortuary texts. Known in ancient Egypt as “The Chapters of Going Forth by Day,” Lepsius dubbed it the Book of the Dead. Its 200 chapters are a thrilling insight into beliefs about the trials, joys, and fears on the journey into death’s mysterious realm.For centuries, it was assumed the writings found in Egyptian tombs were passages from ancient scripture. Later, when scholars learned to decipher hieroglyphs, they discovered that these texts were spells—magic “road maps” provided to the dead to navigate their way safely through the afterlife. (Explore the 4,400-year-old untouched tomb discovered at Saqqara.)Objects accompanied the dead on their journey, such as the pectoral depicting Ahmose I, found in the coffin of his mother.Although scholars had known of the magical content of the writings before Lepsius’s publication, his careful ordering of the spells and the assigning of a chapter number to each is the system still used to study them today. However, there is no uniform version of the Book of the Dead. Of the many versions of the spells that have been found, the texts’construction are not exactly alike—yet the arrangement of Lepsius’s publication helped scholars to see this body of work as a more coherent whole.Passages have been found inscribed on rolls of papyrus, on the bandages used in mummification, on tombs, and on the sarcophagi and grave goods of the dead. Originally intended solely for the use of royalty, the oldest parts of the Book of the Dead were drawn from funerary writings known as the Pyramid Texts, which date back as far as the Egyptian Old Kingdom, to as early as 2300 B.C. (Discover the latest finds in King Tut's tomb.)How and when the Book of the Dead first came to be compiled is a mystery. The earliest known example appeared on the sarcophagus of the 13th-dynasty queen Mentuhotep (1633-1552 B.C.). Between the Middle and New Kingdoms, use of the Book of the Dead was no longer limited to royalty. Anyone with enough money to produce or acquire a version of the text could, it was hoped, increase their chances of a smooth passage through the afterlife.By the New Kingdom (circa 1539–1075 B.C.), access to the Book of the Dead was more widespread. Some copies were lavishly illustrated and costly; others seem more mass-produced with blank spaces where the deceased’s name could be filled in to personalize their copy. Despite the text’s long evolution, however, its function remained the same for royalty and nonroyalty alike: to ease the passage of the deceased through the underworld, offering them protection to face the ordeals and terrors lying in wait there. (Take a look at Egypt's stunning life-lifelike mummy portraits.)Excerpts from the Book of the Dead were intoned by a priest during the funeral ceremony at the tomb. Next came a series of rituals to prepare the dead for their journey. Among these was the rite called “the opening of the mouth,” in which ritual tools were applied to the image of the deceased on the sarcophagus. It was believed this ceremony reactivated the senses of the corpse. (Learn how to make a mummy in 70s days or less.)For the ancient Egyptians this was a moment of hope as expressed in the ninth chapter: “I have opened up every path which is in the sky and which is on earth, for I am the well-beloved son of my father Osiris. I am noble, I am a spirit, I am equipped; O all you gods and all you spirits, prepare a path for me.”The Egyptians believed that the dead person would embark on a subterranean journey, tracing the route of Re, the sun god. After disappearing with the setting sun in the west, Re passed under the world in a boat to return to his starting point in the east. During this journey, the deceased, aboard Re’s boat, would have to confront ferocious creatures barring the way to their new life. The most formidable of these was Apep, a serpent intent on stopping Re’s boat and bringing chaos to the world.Apep would threaten Re every night. If the deceased were to come face-to-face with this terrifying creature, chapter 7 of the Book of the Dead was at hand to offer help:“I will not be inert for you, I will not be weak for you, your poison shall not enter my members, for my members are the members of Atum.”Having made it past Apep, the deceased would eventually arrive at a labyrinth, protected by a series of gates. To go through each one, they had to recite a specific text and call out the name of the gate. If the correct prayer was offered, then the gate would say: “Pass, you are pure.”With a total length of nearly 78 feet, the Ani Papyrus is the most complete surviving version of the Book of the Dead. It was produced around 1275 B.C. for Ani, the royal scribe of Thebes, and his wife, Tutu, priestess of Amun. It was acquired in Luxor in 1888 by Wallis Budge, who published a translation in 1895.  The Ani Papyrus is still held by the British Museum.After the labyrinth, the next stop was the Hall of Two Truths, where the dead would be judged by a panel of 42 judges presided over by the god of the underworld, Osiris. The “defendant” would swear they were innocent of a lengthy list of potential sins. Chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead includes many examples, including: “I have not slain people... I have not stolen the gods’ property... I have not caused (anyone) to weep... I have not carried out grain-profiteering... I have not (sinfully) copulated... I have not been the cause of terror... I have not been impatient... I have not slain sacred cattle.”After the confession came the climax of the trial: the weighing of the heart. Anubis, the jackal god of mummification, held up a pair of scales. In one dish sat an ostrich feather, like that worn by the goddess of justice, Maat, and regarded as a symbol of truth. In the other dish was the dead person’s heart, embodying the actions carried out in their lifetime. If the feather and the heart balanced the scales, the dead person would pass the test. Those whose hearts weighed too much were considered impure and condemned to several horrific fates.The deepest fears of an ancient Egyptian contemplating their lot for eternity are eloquently summarized in chapter 53 of the Book of the Dead. One of the eternal punishments handed down was the prospect of having to eat one’s own excrement: “I detest what is detestable. I will not eat feces, I will not drink urine, I will not walk headdown.” Other dreaded sentences included perpetual hunger and thirst, being boiled, or devoured by a wild beast.Of such importance was the weighing that the Egyptians fashioned amulets, the scarab of the heart, which were placed over the heart of the deceased before mummification. Inscribed on the back was often chapter 30 of the Book of the Dead: “Oh my heart which I had from my mother! O heart of my different ages! Do not stand up as a witness against me, do not be opposed to me in the tribunal, do not be hostile to me in the presence of the Keeper of the Balance.”To the righteous, on the other hand, the way to paradise would now be opened. The virtuous could look forward to the plains of Aaru, “the fields of reeds.” Not unlike the world they’d left behind, this happy land of the dead abounded with rivers, mountains, and lush, fertile fields in which barley would grow up to five cubits high.It was not, however, an exclusively spiritual paradise. There were physical rewards as well. As chapter 110 of the Book of the Dead reveals, corporeal needs and pleasures were not abandoned once one passed into the afterlife. Many of life’s pleasures—eating, drinking, and copulating, to name a few—existed there as they did in life. Specific meals are mentioned: A passage from the rubric to chapter 125 promises Ashens-cake, a jug of beer, a Persen-cake, and a portion of meat from the altar of the Great God.The dead were also expected to labor: Planting and reaping crops were included as part of the afterlife in the Aaru. But work was not all that arduous, as the virtuous dead could now rely on an army of servants to help them. These were the ushabtis, statues entombed with them among the other grave goods. It was believed that magic would convert these statues into servants once the dead passed into Aaru. Each ushabti figurine had its arms crossed and held farming implements. On the lower part of each was inscribed a chapter from the Book of the Dead: “[I]f [name of the deceased] is accounted to do any work in the God’s Domain... the irrigation of the fields, or to water the banks, or to row sand of the east to the west, I will do it. Here I am.”An emphasis on physical as well as spiritual redemption reflects the anxieties of a society troubled by the body’s annihilation. Nevertheless, throughout the Book of the Dead, the reward that the dead could expect if they made correct use of the text is confidently asserted: “He shall flourish and his children shall flourish... he shall be ushered in with the kings of Upper Egypt and the kings of Lower Egypt, and he shall be in the suite of Osiris. A matter a million times true.”",
"A scientific team conducts conservation work on Tutankhamun’s burial chamber in 2016.When Howard Carter unsealed the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, he set off a series of discoveries that would capture the imagination of the world and set off an enduring love affair with the brightly painted 3,300-year-old burial chamber of the boy king and his golden treasures. Almost a century later, a team of scientists has now completed the most significant scrutiny of the tomb to date: a decade-long project of painstaking study and conservation that has solved some mysteries but also raised new questions about the future of one of the world’s most famous ancient monuments.A symposium in Luxor this week details the overall results of the project, undertaken jointly by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the Los Angeles-based Getty Conservation Institute. Work on the 1,182 square-foot tomb, carried out by about a dozen conservators at a time, began in 2009 and was originally anticipated to wrap up by 2014. The project was delayed, however, by revolution in Egypt in 2011, and subsequent unrest in 2013.Does Tut’s tomb really have hidden chambers?"Everybody who goes to the Valley of the Kings wants to go to Tut’s tomb,” said Neville Agnew, the Getty’s lead scientist and conservator on the project. An extensive documentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of the tomb’s condition was required to make a plan for the future: “What happens if we do nothing? We were interested in the entire spectrum of activity, both past, present and future, and how to address those comprehensively.”One of the hallmarks of the tomb is the ubiquitous brown freckles across all of the wall paintings. Present when Carter opened the burial chamber, and exhaustively documented in photographs of the time, the “mystery spots” have endured as a source of curiosity and concern. What are they, exactly? And more importantly, are they multiplying?A study of the spots revealed high concentrations of malic acid, a metabolic byproduct of some fungi and bacteria, which confirms that the spots are microbial in origin. DNA analysis of swabs taken from the tomb walls turned up modern organisms including Bacillus and Kocuria, but electron microscope imaging of the spots showed no remnants of the original organisms that created them. The conservators theorize that because Tut died unexpectedly, the preparation of his tomb was likely a rush job, and the freshly plastered and painted walls would have retained enough moisture for microbes to thrive in the tomb’s dark, warm environment after it was sealed. The conservators can say one thing for certain, however: The spots are quite dead, have been so for a very long time, and are not growing—a fact confirmed by comparisons of photographs taken immediately after the tomb opening with those from present day.Since they are considered part of the history of the tomb, the mystery spots won’t be painted over or removed, Agnew says. That hasn’t always been the view: during earlier studies, the spots have variously been sampled and treated with biocides when it was suspected they might be spreading.One of the stickiest problems in the tomb has been the constant presence of dust. Fine-grained and thirsty, the desert dust tramped in by an estimated 500 to 1,000 daily visitors clings to every tomb surface, and is made even more tenacious since it absorbs humidity from human breath.Though guards could wipe down the glass-covered sarcophagus that now sits in the center of Tut’s burial chamber, there was no damage-free remedy for the fine, streaky veils of dust that accumulated on the tomb’s fragile paintings.So as conservators carried out the meticulous study and cleaning of the wall murals, they also worked out a scheme to tackle the long-term dust problem by installing a sophisticated air filtration and ventilation system which not only filters the dusty scourge out of the tomb environment, but also prevents excess particulates from wafting in. The regular exchange of air has also stabilized temperature and humidity within the tomb, which previously could fluctuate wildly.And, as it turns out, the conservation project tomb revealed some new tomb jinxes: Upon removing the old viewing platform over Tut’s burial chamber to mount the system’s air vents, project workers were surprised to find, among heaps of lint and snippets of trash, scraps of paper with entreaties to Tutankhamun for blessings—and calls for pharaonic curses on other people.Even though the most thorough inspection of Tutankhamun’s tomb in modern history has now wrapped up, several questions about its future still remain.The long-term impact of dust is still a mystery. Found to be comprised primarily of calcium, magnesium, aluminum, and phosphorous, it’s unclear how the dust may chemically interact with the natural minerals in the paints and pigments on the tomb walls over a longer period of time.The physical dangers of increased flooding linked to climate change is another concern and has not yet been considered, Agnew says. Although Tut’s tomb is safe from direct flooding, it’s constructed of the same porous, clay-containing rock as all of its neighbors in the Valley of the Kings. If adjacent tombs flood, vapor could seep through the walls and “absolutely rip apart” the tomb’s plastered walls and their paintings, says Lori Wong, the Getty’s lead paintings conservator on the Tut project.Tourism remains the greatest immediate threat to the tomb. Despite the existence of a high-quality, ultra-detailed replica just a mile away, it’s unclear whether the Egyptian government will ultimately restrict most public access to the original tomb (and therefore reduce a guaranteed revenue stream). France has found that eliminating visitors to the original prehistoric cave art sites at Lascaux and Chauvet, and redirecting them to replicas, has not dinted the public’s interest in the monuments. A relatively new replica at Lascaux drew an estimated 260,000 visitors in 2017."We know the human impact on our heritage,” says Pascal Terrasse, president of the Pont d’Arc Grand Project, a replica of Chauvet cave that draws more than 2,000 visitors a day. “When new technologies become available for heritage protection, managers of historical works must rely on this opportunity. We realized the world's largest fake cave because of digital techniques, which allowed us to do a very realistic job."At the very least, Agnew says he hopes the sum of the recent conservation work on Tutankhamun’s tomb results in a higher awareness of its significance for any who visit in the future.“One should be reminded that a visit to a tomb should be one of humility and interest,” Agnew concludes. “[It’s] not a freak show; [it’s] a tomb for a king, and we need to approach them with reverence. That’s a difficult thing to get to in this age of mass tourism."Visitors peer at the mummified remains of Ramses II in Cairo’s Egyptian Museum.

"Dark, direct, soulful: The eyes of the Al Fayyum portraits stare out and invite viewers in to see the faces of Egyptians who lived thousands of years ago, when the Greek Ptolemy rule gave way to Rome. Created to adorn the dead, these funereal portraits reveal how Egyptian, Roman, and Greek practices began to blend, creating a hybrid culture of enduring fascination to archaeologists and museumgoers alike.In 1887 British archaeologist Flinders Petrie started excavating at the pyramid at Hawara near Egypt’s Al Fayyum Oasis in the hopes of finding tombs from the third millennium B.C. To his disappointment, he uncovered a first-century B.C. Roman-era cemetery instead. Soon his chagrin turned to curiosity and then to mounting excitement: On a mummified body found in one of the brick tombs, his team found a portrait: “the beautifully drawn head of a girl, in soft grey tints, entirely classical in its style and mode.”Over the course of the dig at Al Fayyum, Petrie uncovered some 60 similar panels, whose realism moved him to describe them in his notes almost as they were living, breathing people: “A young, married woman of about 25,” he wrote of another find, “of a sweet but dignified expression, with beautiful features.”Petrie was not the first Westerner to have come across the painted mummy panels of Egypt. In the early 17th century the Italian traveler Pietro della Valle saw lifelike mummy art when he passed through the necropolis of Saqqara just south of the modern-day city of Cairo.Petrie was, nevertheless, the first archaeologist to submit these portraits to academic study, beginning the task of piecing together a unique world in which Egyptian, Greek, and Roman styles and customs began to intertwine from the first century B.C. through to the fourth century A.D. The artistic style seen in the mummy portraits reflected this cultural intermingling and may have influenced later Christian art.The modern-day city of Al Fayyum is located about 60 miles southwest of Cairo, between the Western Desert and the Nile. Known as Shedet during pharaonic times, the city, the nearby oasis, and the surrounding area were transformed when Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., incorporating Egypt into an empire that would grow to encompass what is now Greece, Turkey, the Palestinian territories, Israel, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and much of Central and South Asia.Alexander’s successors, the Ptolemy kings, would rule Egypt for nearly three centuries. They were drawn to the fertile land around Al Fayyum. Irrigation systems of canals were built, and it turned into one of Egypt’s most productive agricultural regions producing abundant crops of fruits, vegetables, and vines.As the region grew prosperous, people from many backgrounds were drawn to the oasis, leading to a multicultural population of Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Many of the Greeks, or Hellenes, had come with Alexander during his conquest.This Roman-era mask shown on this page was found in the Al Fayyum area. Placed over a distinctly Egyptian headdress, the floral wreath reveals a Roman influence. A protective winged divinity appears on either side of the face to guard the deceased in the afterlife. A seated figure of Anubis, god of mummification and protector of the deceased, appears on either side of the face at chin level. Like the masks that had covered the faces of Egyptian mummies for many centuries before, this one is made of cartonnage, a technique in which linen is stiffened with plaster, sculpted into the form of the deceased’s torso and head, and painted. In the Greco-Roman period some masks followed the older, more traditional Egyptian-style designs, typically incorporating a wig and protective necklace known as an usej. This mask features Egyptian gods and religious scenes that will serve to protect the deceased during the journey to the underworld. A crown would often be placed on the head—in this case, a floral wreath, a typically Roman touch. While some masks made an attempt to individualize the deceased’s features, the constraints of cartonnage favored more generic representation.Many local Egyptians were peasants and artisans who migrated from other regions of the country. After 30 B.C. the Roman presence intensified under Octavian—soon to become Emperor Augustus—made Egypt a Roman province following the death of Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemaic rulers and lover of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.Al Fayyum’s multiculturalism expressed itself in many ways: art, religion, and language. Archaeological evidence shows that the burgeoning population spoke and wrote in Greek and took Greek names—such as Antinoüs, Polion, Soter, and Irene—as well as names bearing Egyptian influence, such as Ammonius.Culturally Greek families around Al Fayyum and other parts of northern Egypt seemed perfectly comfortable adopting Egyptian traditions and religious rituals. Many Greek speakers worshipped Osiris, god of the afterlife, and inclined toward Egyptian customs in funerary rites.Found at Hawara, this Roman-era mummy of a young boy, on display in the British Museum, London, is made up of a complex structure of bandages. The cloth is wrapped in thick, decorative layers to form diamond shapes to create an effect of depth and geometric rhythm. In the center of each of these diamonds have been placed small pieces of gold stucco. The feet of the bound figure were created separately from cartonnage (plaster-stiffened linen), and protrude from the sheathed body. The mummy was found complete with its very lifelike portrait, shown here as it would have been placed. Painted on wood using the encaustic technique, the boy in the portrait wears a white mantle. His close-cropped hair, the clothing, and other stylistic details allow researchers to date the mummy to the beginning of the second century A.D.Although cremation and burial were common in the wider ­Greco-Roman world, many recent arrivals in Al Fayyum adopted Egyptian mummification rituals. Recent scholarship suggests the portraits were created to keep the essence of the deceased intact and encapsulate the moment of a person’s transition from life through death and on to the realm of Osiris.Elaborate mummification rituals for elite burials appeared very early in Egypt’s history, during the Old Kingdom, which ended around 2130 B.C. The practice started to spread to the wider population during the Middle Kingdom. Mummies from this time were found wearing funerary masks made from cloth stiffened with plaster. These masks, however, tended to be highly stylized and all looked similar in appearance.In Al Fayyum at the end of the Ptolemaic era and the beginning of Roman rule, Greek and Roman influences become apparent on mummification portraits. Rather than the uniform appearance of the traditional masks, these portraits manifested the same realism present in Greek and Roman works of art. Subjects were depicted naturalistically, creating a vivid image of the deceased that celebrated their lives, virtues, and achievements.Pairs of feet were typically made from cartonnage and adjoined to the mummy during the wrapping.There is a wide range of craftsmanship of mummy portraits from Al Fayyum. Specimens have been found with crude coloring and construction, suggesting that even poorer people were having their portraits done. Many of the faces of Al Fayyum largely belong to the wealthy or professional members of society. Some experts have suggested that these uncannily lifelike images were painted while the people still lived, and decorated their homes until needed to adorn the mummy.In artistic style and technique the portraits follow the Greek style. Although surviving examples of Greek panel paintings from this era are rare, scholars know what they looked like from glowing literary descriptions. The discovery of the Al Fayyum mummy panels finally let historians see, firsthand, the great artistic skill of first-century B.C. artisans. Subjects are generally depicted in a three-quarter rather than frontal view. Shadows and highlights are employed to reveal contours and curves of facial features.Traits of Al Fayyum portraiture—such as its emotional intensity and large eyes—influenced later Christian art. Here, a Byzantine icon from the Russian State Museum, St. Petersburg.Although the images seem highly customized, this impression can be deceptive. Art historians have noticed that many of the paintings are, in fact, schematic drawings onto which individualized traits would be mapped. Close examination of various portraits reveal that there is a basic structure: an oval shape for the face, the position of mouths and noses, and even the poses are often identical from one to another. It is the eyebrows, eyes, hair, and accessories that distinguish the subjects from one another.Identifying the person in the painting has been challenging. A few portraits have Greek inscriptions indicating the name and profession of the deceased on the image itself, such as “Hermione, the Schoolteacher,” but most do not. Visual clues can lend insight to the identity of the deceased. Soldiers and athletes are usually depicted wearing a sash and bare shoulders, respectively. Women are portrayed flaunting splendid jewelry, clothes, and elaborate hairstyles, and children often appear wearing gold necklaces with amulets, a common Roman symbol for childhood.Greco-Roman mummy cases and shrouds were often painted with images reflecting pharaonic religious beliefs about the hereafter but adapted to suit the prevailing Greco-Roman style. Egyptian divinities of the afterlife feature prominently, and include some or all of the following: Osiris, god of the afterlife and the underworld; his sisters Isis (also his wife) and Neftis, also considered a protector of the dead. Anubis, the jackal- or wolfheaded god is also often shown as patron of the mummification process and responsible for delivering the soul of the deceased into the kingdom of Osiris. The falcon god Horus often makes an appearance too. The Greco-Roman tradition had no problem about mixing in classical motifs. So in addition to representations of the Egyptian funerary gods, shrouds and mummy cases might depict figures in Roman dress. Greek elements might be included too: pomegranates, boughs of myrtle and rose, and kraters or goblets of wine, all alluding to eternal life in Greek iconography. On this Roman-era Egyptian shroud, the deceased in the center is dressed in Roman style, flanked to the right by the Egyptian deity Anubis.Stylistic and cultural diversity can also be observed in subtle details concerning the symbolism of the paintings. For instance, the subject of one of the portraits wears a seven-pointed star, a designation of the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis, while others wear crowns of golden leaves, a symbol attributed to Macedon, Greek, and Roman royalty. Aside from their striking appearance, these funereal portraits give scholars great insight into the diverse population of the Al Fayyum region and how different cultures influenced each other. Typically, portraits show their subjects looking their best, so the clothing, hairstyles, and accessories reflect the fashion of the time. They show people dressed not in the Egyptian manner but in the Roman style, showing the influence of the imperial court.Mummy portrait panels were typically painted on wood, although some were painted on stiffened linen. Many artists created their paint by mixing beeswax with pigment and making applications in multiple layers, a technique known as encaustic. The term is from the Greek for “burnt in,” but no burning is necessary for creating the paints or the portraits. This method likely originated in the Greek world and may have been introduced to Egypt at the time of Alexander’s conquests. The layering of different colors helps achieve a distinctive range of subtle hues to give the image intensity and depth.Encaustic portraits are easy to spot due to their glossy finish. Some artists employed tempera paint, a mixture of pigment, egg, and water, for portraits. Unlike the reflective surface of the encaustic works, finished tempera portraits often have a flat, matte finish. Another important detail in some of the more costly portraits is the application of gold leaf, which gives the crowns and the jewelry their richness and glow.At the end of the fourth century A.D. Emperor Theodosius I ordered the suppression of mummification in a bid to strengthen Christian orthodoxy across the empire. Despite the disappearance of a ritual that had been part of Egyptian culture for millennia, the mummy portraits would themselves enjoy a kind of afterlife.Echoes of the Al Fayyum panels can be seen in later artworks of the Byzantine period and medieval Europe, as well as in early Christian art. Their individuality, large eyes, and use of gold leaf would live on in Byzantine icons, and in the art of medieval and Renaissance Europe centuries later. Nearly 1,000 of these portraits are held in museum collections worldwide—from Egypt to London to Los Angeles—allowing modern people to gaze into the eyes of the past.Eva Subías Pascual is associate professor of archaeology at the Rovira i Virgili University, Spain.",
"Standing on wooden steps that protect a 3,300-year-old stone staircase, Egyptian antiquities chief Zahi Hawass poses in 2009 in a mysterious tunnel that links the ancient tomb of Pharaoh Seti I to ... nothing.  After three years of hauling out rubble and artifacts via a railway-car system (rails visible at left), the excavators have hit a wall, the team announced last week. It seems the ancient workers who created the steep tunnel under Egypt's Valley of the Kings near Luxor (map) abruptly stopped after cutting 572 feet (174 meters) into rock. Hawass, also a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence, believes work on the tunnel began during the pharaoh's 15-year reign (1294-1279 B.C.), but after the tomb above it was already complete. Work may have stopped when Seti I died. Archaeologist Mustafa Waziri, regional director for the Egyptian antiquities council, said: "I think they were planning to make another burial chamber down there. Suddenly they stopped. But the condition of the stairs is amazing."  (The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News.) —Andrew Bossone and Ted Chamberlain",
"The first panels of the facsimile are erected in the replica's underground chamber. (Adam Lowe is at upper right.)The thing to understand about archaeology is that it's a science of destruction. The moment an ancient site is discovered, its physical condition immediately begins to deteriorate. Every dig removes a layer of the archaeological record that can never be replaced, and once humans are allowed to visit, with their hot breath and sweat and backpacks, walls start crumbling, pigments start flaking, and before you know it the site has to close down to "rest," or close for good—a victim of its own celebrity.Now, a practice is gaining traction that may save us from inadvertently wrecking the very cultural treasures we most want to see: the creation of high-tech copies of ancient archaeological sites. We're not talking sized-down Las Vegas knockoffs of the Pyramids but forensically analyzed, 3-D copies so minutely detailed that the naked eye can't distinguish them from the originals.Recently in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, the most ambitious large-scale creation of this kind was unveiled: an exact replica of the 3,245-year-old tomb of King Tutankhamun, apparently so authentic that one Egyptologist in attendance (Salima Ikram from The American University in Cairo) actually wept when she saw the burial chamber."She had a very emotional reaction, even knowing she was in a copy—that was a great moment for me," said Adam Lowe, the British artist whose Madrid-based company, Factum Arte, made the replica as a philanthropic project; he donated his team's time and raised money to cover other costs. The $690,000 project took five years, beginning in 2009, when the team used state-of-the-art laser scanning and digitizing equipment to minutely "record" every aspect of the tomb.So the replica is a replica of the tomb circa 2009. It is not an attempt to present the tomb in its original imagined splendor, or even as it may have looked in 1922, when British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered it while excavating near the tomb of Ramses VI. On what Carter had thought would be a final dig, his workmen came upon a step carved into a rock that eventually led him to Tutankhamun; Tut was 19 when he died in 1322 B.C., possibly murdered by enemies or killed in a chariot crash or hippo attack, according to speculations over the years.Underground in the sand, next to what had been Carter's house at the entrance to the Valley of the Kings and within a mile of the real tomb, is where they situated the replica. It occupies the same size footprint as the original, but the antechamber has been turned into a museum that documents all things Tut—the discovery, the contents, the "mummy's curse," and more. Why and how it looks the way it does, the difficulty of preserving it, the remarkable skill of Egyptian craftsmen who made it three and a half thousand years ago. Together, the antechamber and Carter's house provide a comprehensive biography of the tomb, something the real one, considered too sacred to be adulterated by even the most well-meaning ways of the world, cannot offer."You walk down the ramp, same as the tomb," said Lowe of the replica, and pass through the antechamber museum. "But then, as you look into the burial chamber, at that moment something very physical happens. The chamber is identical."One of the Egyptian team unpacks a panel of the facsimile for installation.How They Did ItFirst of all, the replica isn't a clone, which technically would be a molecular copy. The team recorded the original site (using high-resolution color photography and 3-D laser scanning systems that measured up to one hundred million points per square meter), then took the hard drives back to their workshops in Madrid and, as Lowe put it, "rematerialized the physical site."They started with the walls. To get the surfaces right, they used a routing machine to cut and shape a rigid foam board made of high-density polyurethane. This router was controlled by a computer, and the computer could direct what the router did, up to a resolution of less than a quarter of a millimeter and operating in three dimensions. "It looks like a high-speed drill moving left and right, up and down, and in space," said Lowe. "We tell the machine to move back and forth cutting the surface until it resembles the original." The relief was then molded in silicone, cast in a dense resin, and backed with a sound-absorbent material to add acoustics.A more complex and tedious challenge came next: duplicating the painted wall scenes of the "boy king" Tut's journey by boat into the afterlife. To do it, they had to devise what Lowe described as "fine elastic skins" using an acrylic gesso. The skins were run off in layers on a specially designed flatbed digital printer, then worked together until the color, tone, and sheen were an exact match and could be mapped onto the surface by hand—a slow, meticulous process. "It had to be a perfect fit to work," Lowe said. Once positioned, the assembled skin was adhered to the wall in a vacuum bag to ensure uniform pressure on the contact adhesive as it cured.The sarcophagus was made essentially the same way as the walls, routed and then cast in resin, with its color applied by hand. The last thing was the lid, made from a mixture of gypsum, different pigments, and animal glue, which formed a granite-like material that was a close look-alike to the original's. "It was a lot like cooking," said Lowe. (Apparently, there was a lot of kneading.)The tomb was assembled in Madrid, then cut into manageable sections before being shipped back home for reassembly."Every bit of micro bacteria is in its place, every crack, every flake of paint," said Lowe. "It's effectively like a portrait, or a performance, of the tomb from when we recorded it in 2009." Over the past five years, a tremendous amount of love and care and human engagement has gone into the work, and that's what Lowe thinks people react to when they see it. "It's King Tut mediated through new technology and human skills. It's this mix, where technology comes together in the right spirit and communicates something very emotionally powerful that few expected."The interior of the facsimile of Tut's tomb is seen here from the perspective of the viewing gallery.Beyond TutThe backdrop to the arrival of technological marvels like this facsimile is the emergence of a new field, cyber archaeology. Cyber archaeology seeks to embrace digital technology while looking for ways it can serve, enhance, and share the "experience" of antiquity. It's a marriage of state-of-the-art digital tools with computer science, archaeology, engineering, and natural sciences.One approach is to make a physical copy, like Lowe's; the other is to do scholarly research about a site without actually having to be at the site. Archaeologists now have the capability to digitally record an entire excavation and manipulate the data to create a 3-D framework that can then be projected through a slew of adjoined television screens in such a way that you feel as though you're walking around inside a video."We're able to walk away from an excavation with the whole archaeological site on a hard drive," said Thomas Levy. He's a professor of anthropology and archaeology at the University of California, San Diego and associate director of the Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology."Let's say you wanted to test your ideas about when a site was built, which we did with a contentious site in Jordan related to King Solomon's mines," he said. "With this amazing data I've collected, I can then take you into a 3-D visualization theater and we can enter the excavation. I can be in San Diego and I can get a cup of coffee and I can throw in my 3-D data set with geo-reference pics of the actual excavation, and I can walk around in it again."What he was describing sounded suspiciously like a "holodeck," or perhaps a precursor to a holodeck—the computer-driven theater on Star Trek: The Next Generation that can create fully functional, entirely "solid" three-dimensional environments from any place and time that the characters then interact with. The apparatus in San Diego that Levy's talking about involves 30 television screens that "we kind of knit together, put in a kind of wave pattern or circle, and you can walk in front of them or around them and they have the ability to track your vision, so if you tilt your head you can look around corners." The effect is a realistic experience that Levy says can have its own emotional impact: "What if I go to Machu Picchu but can't stay up on the mountain past four in the afternoon, but somebody did a digital reconstruction and recorded it at sunset? Then I can go back home to UCSD and project it through our 3-D visualization environment and have that experience."As for the Tut facsimile: Although it is "actually" in Egypt, he said, the beauty of the technology is it allows anyone who has those data files to make a copy "anywhere on the planet." In a pleasing irony, technology may pave the way to sustainable tourism and actually save antiquity—"sharing" it with a broader audience than ever imagined while sparing the originals from the ravages of tourism and making it difficult for any privileged few to hoard world cultural heritage and keep it unavailable.This emergence of cyber archaeology raises questions it will take years to resolve as "archaeological policy" makers sort out the headaches and opportunities: Who owns the data? What do you do with the original sites as you run out of room on the planet? How do you distribute collected digital data ethically?"It's really exciting," Levy said.Workers create the tomb's exterior. The replica is less than a mile from the real tomb.Replicas? "Why not?"It's not as if there haven't been archaeological copies in the past, notably the Lascaux cave in southwestern France and the Altamira cave in northern Spain, both famous for their Paleolithic drawings and both created before the new technology. A complete site re-creation is under way at Lascaux; another is in the works for the Chauvet cave in the Ardèche region of France.Most archaeologists seem to be in favor of them, according to Robert Brier, an Egyptologist and senior research fellow at Long Island University. "Experientially, replicas are fabulous," he said. The fabricated Tut "is not going to hurt anybody, and it'll do good for Egypt and save the tomb. It's a no-brainer." The question, he said, is will tourists pay to visit even fabulous fakes—and how much? As one reader wrote in the comments following an online article: "Can we pay fake money to see them?"One archaeologist who has reassessed the value of copies is David Silverman, professor of Egyptology at the University of Pennsylvania; he's in charge of the Egyptian collection at the Penn archaeological museum and has been the curator of two traveling King Tut exhibitions. In the past, he always advocated seeing the originals. But they're so fragile and there are such problems maintaining them because of their vulnerability to wind erosion, air pollution, neglect, looting, and willful destruction, not to mention the corrosive effects of carbon dioxide and moisture disseminated by tourists. (At its height, the original King Tut received a thousand visitors a day in a space of 60 meters—about 72 yards—square that was never meant to be visited at all.) "It's not easy" to keep the sites up, Silverman said, and sometimes it's not easy for people to get to them. "So I'm re-looking at it and saying, OK, there isn't any other way—is this a good thing to do? And I think, why not?"Of course everyone would prefer to experience "the real thing," Lowe said. But since the opening of the replica, he has sensed a shift away from the more purist beliefs regarding authenticity. "If what's important is deepening understanding, then this replica is an approach that can lead to a deeper understanding. If it's about some kind of prejudice that you have to see the original, then you need to confront your own prejudices." The original site is expected to remain open for some time. "People are actually going to both sites and asking themselves quite profound questions," and the more they do that, and talk and share, he said, "the happier I'll be." The "No Photos" signs? He wants them replaced with ones that say, "Please Take Photos."Meanwhile, Back in Egypt: A Facsimile Cottage IndustryLowe is moving forward with the next phase of a project that started with King Tut. Members of his Factum Arte team are going to teach local workers in Luxor, the ancient capital, where the replica resides, how to do what they did—digitally document sites and then rematerialize them. Two more are on the drawing board: Seti I, said to be the largest and most important tomb in the Valley, and Nefertari, said to be the most beautiful. Historically, tourism has been a big source of income and foreign currency for Egypt, but due to political chaos and explosions in Cairo, the numbers are way down. It's a lot to ask of a replica to reinvigorate the market and eventually attract half a million visitors a year. But that's the sacred wish."The response locally has been very emotional," Lowe said. "The people realize this could be their future"—a source of jobs in the region for years to come—"and have taken it on board. It could become a whole industry!"He has a vision of tourists actually wanting to visit the workshops where the facsimiles are being made. He sees the Tut data being used to monitor decay in the actual tomb. He sees scholars—or, especially, just anybody—diving into this digital world and finding themselves unexpectedly deepened, as human beings, and actually experiencing a personal link with antiquity."All of this is a real game-changer."",
"In this 13th-century B.C. mural from the tomb of Horemheb in the Valley of the Kings, the goddess Isis wears a headress of cow horns and a sun disk.Archaeologists working in London in 1912 might have been surprised. When they discovered a first-century A.D. Roman jug bearing the inscription “Londini ad fanum Isidis—London, next door to the Temple of Isis.” Best known as an Egyptian goddess, finding signs of Isis worship so far from North Africa might seem odd. But this goddess proved popular enough to transcend her original Egyptian centers of worship and expand to all corners of the known world.Isis was loved by ancient Egyptians for her fierce devotion to her husband Osiris and her son Horus. Her cult first began to spread around the Mediterranean following the establishment of Hellenist rule in Egypt in the fourth century B.C. Then as Roman power expanded, worship of Isis went even farther afield.By the second century A.D., the Roman writer Apuleius would glorify her as the “mother of stars, the parent of seasons, and the mistress of all the world.” Yet while she meant many things to many cultures across the Roman world, her roots lie in a very specific place and time: the Nile Delta at the dawn of ancient Egyptian history. (In ancient Egypt, women rulers kept society stable in times of trouble.)Isis is the Greek form of the goddess’s name, which in ancient Egyptian was Aset, meaning “seat” or “throne.” Depicted as a slim woman wearing a sheath dress, she is often shown with a throne on her head. As her divine roles diversified, her appearance would change. Hathor, an early Egyptian goddess of motherhood, was often shown with a solar disk and cow horns. As Isis became closely linked to maternity, her headdress morphed and became like Hathor’s. Isis’s ability to absorb new traits would prove valuable to the longevity and spread of her worship throughout the ancient world.Isis (right), wearing a horned solar disk, and her son Horus gesture to the seated Osiris on a ninth-century B.C. gold pendant. Louvre Museum, ParisIn one of the most popular tellings of the Isis myth, she is one of the children of the gods Geb, god of the earth, and Nut, goddess of the sky. She marries one of her brothers, the god Osiris, and the pair rule the world. Osiris is murdered by his jealous younger brother Set, who dismembers the body and scatters it. Grieving, Isis searches the world to collect the pieces and puts him back together. Osiris is revived, but rather than being the lord of the living, Osiris becomes lord of the dead. Isis gives birth to a son, Horus (a popular art motif depicts Isis nursing her infant son). Horus grows up to banish Set, restoring order to the world. (Explore a Greek cave that legend says is the entrance to the underworld.)The earliest mention of Isis can be found in the Pyramid Texts, sacred inscriptions carved in tomb walls of pyramids in Saqqara dating back to the Old Kingdom (circa 2575-2150 B.C.). Among the most ancient sacred writings, these texts center on pharaonic funerary rituals and beliefs about the journey of kings through the afterlife. (These are the sacred and secret rituals in the Book of the Dead.)At first Isis was only worshipped in the Nile Delta where she originated, but she grew to become an important deity for the whole of ancient Egypt.Known for her magic, her beneficent power encompassed both daily life and the afterlife. As Egyptian notions of the afterlife became more democratic, she was considered the protector of all the dead across Egyptian society, not just the pharaohs and their families at the top. Egyptian women regarded her as the model mother and wife. Her reputation as one of the warmest and most humane of the gods would later win hearts outside Egypt.When Alexander the Great conquered Egypt in 332 B.C., the worship of Isis would flourish and expand beyond Egypt. Rather than censor Egyptians’ local religion, Alexander embraced it. While visiting the city of Memphis, Alexander made sacrifices to Apis, an Egyptian bull god also associated with Osiris, and connected the deity’s power to his own reign. (See ancient Egypt's stunning, lifelike mummy portraits.)Following Alexander’s death in 323 B.C., one of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, took control of Egypt and continued the practice of religious tolerance. This dynasty, the so-called Ptolemies, would continue to unite the new Macedon elite with the local Egyptian population through faith.Located in Upper Egypt near the border of modern Sudan, the island of Philae was sacred to Isis. Temples had been built to her there since the sixth century B.C. Construction on an impressive new temple for Isis began shortly before Alexander’s conquest and was finished by Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his successor, Ptolemy III Euergetes, in the third century B.C.Under Ptolemaic rule, aspects of Osiris and Apis were combined with traits of Greek gods, including Zeus and Hades, to create a syncretic deity, Serapis. His association with the underworld, and therefore with Osiris, helped the framers of the new Ptolemaic cult settle on Isis as Serapis’s consort.Their center of worship was in Alexandria, a major commercial center under the Ptolemies. To Alexandrian merchants, Isis and Serapis became associated with prosperity in addition to the afterlife, healing, and fertility.As the worship of Isis spread throughout the ancient world, artworks showing the goddess adapted to the cultures that were embracing her. Here, a Egyptian panel depicts Isis spreading her protective wings around a pharaoh of the sixth century B.C. Archaeological Civic Museum of Bologna, ItalyAs Ptolemaic influence spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean, worship of Isis also traveled along the trade routes to the coastlines of modern-day Syria, Israel, and Turkey. She became linked with regional deities. In Greece Isis was originally linked with Demeter, goddess of agriculture. In and around Lebanon she was associated with the Middle Eastern goddess Astarte. In Roman cities she was linked with Fortuna, goddess of luck, and Venus, goddess of love. The first- and second-century A.D. writer Plutarch likened her to Persephone, consort of Hades, the lord of the underworld. (Here's how the Greek's changed the way we think about life after death.)Temples to Isis were erected throughout the Mediterranean world. Among them was the Temple of Isis on Delos in the Aegean, a tiny, arid island that became an important trading post in the Ptolemaic era. The impressive Doric Temple of Isis, whose ruins still stand on the island, was built in the early second century B.C. Roman merchants operating on Delos adopted the Isis cult they found there and took it back with them when they returned to Naples, Campania, Ostia, Rome, and Sicily. Isis had become an emblem of Ptolemaic hegemony; by the first century B.C., her cult reached as far west as Spain.As worship of Isis continued to spread, the goddess’s responsibilities expanded as well. In addition to her traditional roles as wife, mother, healer, and protector of the dead, Isis was worshipped as the goddess of good fortune, the sea, and travel. Sailors revered her: A festival held every spring became associated with Isis and was later known across the Roman world as Navigium Isidis. Many cities that depended on maritime trade, such as Pompeii, looked to Isis to defend them from the caprices of Neptune. One of the best preserved temples of Isis can be found in Pompeii. Built in the first century A.D., its frescoes depict Isis as Roman worshippers would have imagined her: in a Hellenized form, rather than Egyptian.By the first century B.C., Isis worship had become established as a “mystery religion.” Rooted in Greek culture, mystery faiths centered on a figure of a god or goddess—such as Demeter or Dionysus—and involved confidential rituals and rites.Participation in these sects was highly secretive, and few details of their ceremonies survive. In the writings of Plutarch, a few can be found. Initiates donned colorful robes and shaved off their hair. During their initiations and other rituals, they carried the sistrum, a large rattle associated with the goddess. Historians remain unsure of certain details, such as how the religion was organized and if there was any hierarchy at all.Roman rulers were not as fond of Isis as Alexander the Great’s generals had been centuries before. Rome tried to suppress the popular cult several times. In the first century B.C., Queen Cleopatra of Egypt had closely linked herself with the goddess Isis, claiming to be her manifestation on Earth. When she and Mark Antony challenged the authority of Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus), the cult of Isis became a symbol of foreign corruption. After Cleopatra’s death in 30 B.C., Ptolemaic rule of Egypt came to an end, Roman control of Egypt began, and the worship of Isis in Rome was suppressed.Later emperors ordered her temples to be destroyed, but worship of Isis was reinstated in Rome in the first century A.D. The great double temple of Isis and Serapis near the Campus Martius in Rome became an important religious center. The cult of Isis grew and reached its peak in the Roman Empire during the second century A.D. Worship of the goddess spread throughout the Roman world, reaching as far north as Britain and as far east as Asia.The growth of a new faith, Christianity, led to a steady decline in the popularity of Isis. In the mid-sixth century, Emperor Justinian closed her temple at Philae in southern Egypt and expelled her priests, extinguishing the official flame of Isis that had burned steadily in Egypt for 2,000 years.",
"The world of ancient Greece was filled with gods, led by the towering Olympians—Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Poseidon, Athena, and other giants of mythology. Alongside worship of these divine inhabitants of Olympus were hundreds of cults focused on local deities and heroes.People prayed to these gods for the same reasons we pray today: for health and safety, for prosperity, for a good harvest, for safety at sea. Mostly they prayed as communities, and through offerings and sacrifice they sought to please the inscrutable deities who they believed controlled their lives.But what happens after death? In this, the ancients looked to Hades, god of the underworld, brother of Zeus and Poseidon. But Hades gave no reassurance. Wrapped in misty darkness, cut by the dread River Styx, the realm of Hades (“the unseen”) was, the poet Homer tells us, a place of “moldering horror” where ordinary people—and even heroes—went after they died.Sympathetic interest in the human condition eventually led the Greeks to adopt new forms of religion and new cults. No longer seen as a joyless fate, the afterlife became more of a personal quest. Mystery cults, shrouded in secrecy, promised guidance for what would come after death. The mystery rites were intensely emotional and staged like elaborate theater. Those of the great gods on the Greek island of Samothrace took place at night, with flickering torch fire pointing the way for initiates. Guarded on pain of death, the rituals remain mysterious to this day.By the fourth century B.C., cults had emerged that claimed to offer purification by cleansing initiates of the stain of humanity. The foundations for new religions were falling into place. And when Christianity swept the ancient world, it carried with it, along with guidance from a single deity, remnants of the old beliefs: the washing away of human corruption through mystic rites, the different fates awaiting the initiated and uninitiated, and the reverence for sacred texts.As described by Homer, the gods and goddesses who ruled from Olympus possessed human traits such as lust, petulance, jealousy, and dishonesty. They also had a superhuman advantage: immortality.Greeks seeking guidance saw oracles as a direct line of communication with the divine. The gods’ answers to their questions came in different ways—obscure riddles, omens in the form of birds or lightning, even the rustle of leaves.Shared religious rites united ancient Greek villages and regions. Worship intially was communal, but as people sought meaning in life and hope for an afterlife, they were drawn to cults that stressed a more individual relationship with the divine.Believing that the dead could exert bad or good influence from the afterlife, ancient Greeks sought their ancestors’ favor with honors and offerings. Many also believed that their own fate after death was directly related to their initiation into the right cults.Which is better, life or the afterlife? In Homer’s Odyssey, the slain hero Achilles answers from the underworld: “I would rather serve as laborer to a serf, to a landless man who has no great livelihood, than rule all the perished dead.”",
"Egypt’s first laws emerged when the Upper and Lower kingdoms were unified, according to tradition, under King Menes around 2950 B.C. From then on, different pharaohs would bring their own approaches to law and order. Although rulers would change, the unifying principle of the monarch’s sovereignty did not. Pharaohs held supreme authority in settling disputes, but they often delegated these powers to other officials such as governors, viziers, and magistrates, who could conduct investigations, hold trials, and issue punishments. Unlike the legal Code of Hammurabi, developed in the 18th century B.C. in Mesopotamia, ancient Egyptian law was not set in stone, and although power always flowed from the pharaoh, Egypt’s laws were rather like the Nile: fluid, organic, and changing with the times. (See also: The truth behind Egypt's female pharaohs and their power.)In Egyptian cosmology, the goddess Maat embodied the concepts of order, truth, and justice. Viziers often wore a pendant in the form of the goddess, who is often shown with an ostrich feather on her head. Egyptians believed that living according to her precepts—honesty, loyalty, and obedience to the king—would keep chaos at bay. Egyptian kings were not exempt from living by Maat’s principles. They too were expected to uphold order through wise rule, just decisions, and humility before the gods. This belief united commoners and kings in the responsibility for maintaining balance and harmony in society, which may have led to fewer periods of civil unrest in Egypt’s long history.Crimes in ancient Egypt tended to be divided into two categories: crimes against the state and crimes against individuals. Desertion, treason, and slandering the pharaoh fell into the first, while acts such as homicide, injury, robbery, and theft fell into the second. Much of what is known about ancient Egypt’s legal system comes from the New Kingdom period (ca 1539-1075 B.C.) and the archaeological site of Deir el Medina, across the Nile from Thebes. Located there was a village of artisans and workers, who labored in the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, building tombs for pharaohs and their families. Digs at Deir el Medina have yielded more than 250 papyri and some ostraca (fragments of stone and potsherds) containing detailed accounts of legal matters at all levels of society. (See also: National Geographic to host exhibition "Queens of Egypt.")Egyptian pharaohs were expected to rule in perfect balance and harmony, which they called "Maat." The concept signified order, truth, and justice and was embodied by a goddess of the same name who wore an ostrich feather headdress. According to Egyptian theology, Maat's feather would be weighed against a deceased person's heart to measure how virtuous a life had been. Egyptian writings emphasize that the king, as the intermediary between the gods and humankind, had a duty to ensure Maat in Egypt: “Ra has placed the king in the land of the living forever and ever . . . to guarantee Maat and to wipe out Isfet [chaos and injustice],” says a theological treaty written in the time of Queen Hatshepsut (1490-1468 B.C.). The vizier, Egypt’s supreme legal authority, held the title Priest of Maat, and often wore amulets featuring emblems of the goddess.The texts reveal the different ways that people could seek justice. One of the most popular was the use of divine oracles. In and around Thebes the oracular voice was attributed to a deceased pharaoh, Amenhotep I, the focus of an important Theban cult. The second king of the 18th dynasty, Amenhotep I consolidated Egyptian power following his father’s expulsion of the Hyksos invaders from Lower Egypt. Although his own tomb has not been found, Amenhotep I is believed to have started the tradition of rulers being buried in the Valley of the Kings. He and his mother, Ahmose Nefertari, are also credited with founding the village at Deir el Medina and were worshipped as patron gods there. (See also: We may now know which Egyptian pharaoh challenged Moses.)Although it was common for especially renowned pharaohs to become the center of cults after their death, Amenhotep’s is among the most popular and enduring. Egyptians believed that his spirit resided in his oracular statue and proper ceremonies could summon it. Residents often turned to the statue to settle legal disputes.Bearing Amenhotep I’s statue on their shoulders, priests would carry it out of the temple during processions and on feast days. A crowd would gather around it, and litigants would present their cases to the statue. Each side would present its case or question, either verbally or in writing. The god’s answers were interpreted by its swaying movements.The workers consulted the statue for centuries. One fragment from the Deir el Medina site dates to the 20th dynasty. It records the request of a workman, Nekhemmut, who asked the statue to reveal the identity of a person who was stealing from him. From the records found among the ostraca, most inquiries were similar, mundane matters, centering on real estate and personal property.Oracular statues were also consulted in other parts of Egypt during the New Kingdom. Located close to Thebes, a statue of the god Amun was also consulted on legal matters. Sometimes, those accused by an oracle would protest against the verdict, and ask for the matter to be put before another oracular statue for a second opinion. Inscribed during the reign of Ramses III, papyrus 10335 (now in the British Museum) recounts the theft of five dyed tunics from a temple storehouse. The crime was brought before an oracle. The statue’s answers fingered one suspect from a list of names as the guilty party. The accused vociferously denied the charge and requested a second and then a third opinion. After his last request, the patience of the gods, and the crowd, ran out. He was found guilty, beaten on the spot as punishment, and forced to restore the stolen goods to the temple.The snake goddess Meretseger was revered and feared by the people of Thebes who built the Valley of the Kings. Her name means “she who loves silence,” and she guarded the tombs in the Theban necropolis. Workers also referred to her as “Peak of the West,” a nod to the pyramid-shaped mountaintop (known today as Al Qurn) above the Valley of the Kings, where she dwelled. The goddess’s appearance varies across different works of art, but snakes feature heavily in her iconography; often she is shown as a coiled cobra with a woman’s head. The workers of Thebes believed that the goddess punished criminals and oath breakers with blindness and venomous snakebites.In addition to the oracles, there was another, more formal method of resolving legal disputes during the New Kingdom. The kenbet (secular court) most closely resembles the approach of modern trials by jury. Two major kenbets were located in Memphis and Thebes and functioned like a high court. The major kenbet juries consisted of higher-ranking members of society, such as scribes of the vizier of Thebes or police chiefs. There is evidence that access to the kenbet service was surprisingly democratic, and that petitioners of higher social status were not given preferential treatment.The kenbet typically handled civil issues such as nonpayment for goods or services, disputes and quarrels between neighbors, theft, injuries, and calumnies. The kenbets were empowered to administer punishments for the minor offenses that came before them, which usually entailed the guilty party suffering a beating. In a few cases, when a kenbet could not reach a decision, it would recommend that the question be submitted to the oracular statues for resolution.Lesser kenbet councils sat in the region’s smaller towns, like the builders’ village. They would hear complaints of local residents and decide their cases. Scholars believe that juries consisted of craftsmen and artisans, who would sit in judgment over their fellow workers. If a serious crime originated in the lower kenbet, it would be moved up the legal system to the major kenbet councils, which reported directly to the vizier, the pharaoh’s principal minister.Famous among historians, one case originated in the local kenbet near Deir el Medina. The accused, a woman called Heria, was initially charged with stealing a cup from a resident. The lower kenbet ordered that Heria’s house be searched for the missing property. The search revealed not only the cup but also goods missing from the temple of Amun. Theft from a temple was a more serious crime. The kenbet found Heria guilty of stealing the cup and then passed the matter of the stolen temple goods to be judged by the vizier. When passing off the case, the kenbet sent a letter to the vizier noting its thoughts: “Heria is a great fraud who deserves to die.”The vizier was one of the most powerful officials in Egypt. Second in power only to the pharaoh, he oversaw the administrative functions of the government. For serious crimes, the vizier served as judge and could dole out punishments or grant pardons. (See also: 25 captivating photos of Egypt.)A papyrus known as Salt 124 details a case from the 20th dynasty that was heard by the vizier. The case was brought by Amennakht, a worker at Deir el Medina, against another worker, Paneb. The list of crimes was long: Amennakht charged Paneb with theft, looting tombs, death threats, bribery, misappropriation of tools belonging to the government, bullying the villagers, sexual assault, blasphemy, and murder. Paneb defended himself by claiming that Amennakht was seeking revenge because he felt Paneb had stolen a job from him.The case most likely came before the vizier because of the charges of tomb raiding. Stealing from one’s neighbor was a crime for the kenbet. Stealing from the royal dead or from Egyptian temples was a much graver offense.When people were convicted of crimes, the penalties depended both on the severity of the offense and their level of involvement. The typical penalty for stealing was returning the stolen object and paying its rightful owner double or triple its value. If someone stole from a temple, however, the punishment was more severe: it could include paying a hundred times the value of the object, corporal punishment, or even death.Little evidence has been found for imprisonment in ancient Egypt. Criminal punishment tended to be administered immediately rather than by means of a long sentence. Forced labor was common, and criminals were also threatened with exile to Nubia, where scholars believe they were put to work in mines. Corporal punishment was also common in the form of public beatings, brandings, or mutilations.The most serious crimes, like treason, were punishable by death. One of the most famous occurrences of the death penalty resulted from the harem conspiracy against Ramses III in the early 12th century B.C. The Judicial Papyrus of Turin documents the plot and how the king’s secondary wife, Tiye, conspired to kill Ramses and install her son, Pentawere, on the throne.Part of Tiye’s plot succeeded: Analysis of Ramses III’s mummy revealed that his throat had been slashed, and he did not survive the attack. The other part of Tiye’s plot failed: The conspiracy was uncovered before Pentawere could take the throne. Ramses IV quickly shored up his power as the new king and turned to punishing his father’s assassins.The Judicial Papyrus extensively details the charges, trials, and punishments of those involved in the wide-ranging conspiracy, who held positions at all levels of Ramses III’s court, from harem officials to servants. Penalties ranged from death to mutilation. Tiye’s chief conspirator received a harsh sentence:The great criminal Paibekkamen . . . had been in collusion with Teye [sic] and the women of the harem; he had made common cause with them . . . He was placed before the great officials of the Court of Examination; . . . his crimes seized him; the officials who examined him caused his punishment to overtake him.How the law dealt with Queen Tiye is unknown, but her son Pentawere was allowed to commit suicide. Scholars believe the lesser conspirators were put to death by impalement. The pharaoh’s justice was unrelenting because his role in keeping order, according to Maat’s principles, was critical to preserving the well-being of Egypt.",
"About 200 A.D., a high-ranking Germanic warrior was slain in battle somewhere in modern-day Denmark. When the battle was over, his killers stripped off his precious coat of mail armor, painstakingly made by hand from nearly 20,000 tiny iron rings. Then they threw it in a bog as a sacrifice to their gods in exchange for victory in battle.Known as the Vimose coat, the 22-pound piece of armor was discovered by archaeologists near Vimose, Denmark in the late 19th century. The armor is nearly complete, preserved by unusual low-oxygen conditions in the bog.More than 1,800 years after it was deposited, researchers are using technology developed to power video games to figure out how the mail coat was worn, and how it might have hung on its long-dead owner—all without actually putting it on. A final report on their research was published Wednesday in the Journal of Cultural Heritage.Researchers trying to understand how people in the past dressed have it relatively easy: The way fabrics stretch, fold and hang is familiar. “The texture is stretchable and soft and not so heavy. It responds to gravity in a certain way,” says Aleksei Moskvin, a co-author of the study and computer scientist at the Saint Petersburg State University of Industrial Technologies and Design.Reconstructing how mail armor (sometimes referred to as chain mail) was worn, however, is a deceptively difficult challenge. The thousands of tiny, interlocking metal rings that make up a coat of mail—a type of armor that emerged around 300 B.C. and was worn into battle for centuries by everyone from Germanic tribes to Roman legionaries and Spanish conquistadores—are different. The way gravity tugs on one link ripples out to influence the way the others hang and move. Mail laid flat on a table bunches differently than it might when draped over a warrior’s shoulders.That’s not the only reason researchers struggle to understand how ancient armor was worn and used. “You cannot put on such an ancient artifact,” says Martijn Wijnhoven, an archaeologist at the VU University Amsterdam and co-author of the study. “If you want to interact with it in order to test how it behaved, you have to come up with other solutions.”Using cutting-edge technology developed for the video game industry, Moskvin and Wijnhoven led an effort to do just that. Curators at the Danish National Museum allowed Wijnhoven to put the coat on a mannequin to see how the real thing looked when worn.Then the team used computer code written to power video games, called engines, to individually model individual rings in the Vimose shirt and “hung” the digital version on a virtual mannequin. The biggest challenge: Calculating the physics behind the way nearly 20,000 individual rings interacted. “Twenty or 100 rings—it’s not a problem,” Moskvin says. “But it’s difficult to simulate the interactions between 19,000 rings.”Once the research team demonstrated that a computer could accurately recreate the mail armor, they used computer models of clothing found in similar bog deposits to see how the virtually reconstructed mail armor would look, fit, and function on a fully-dressed warrior in battle. “I really like this kind of approach,” says Gregory Aldrete, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay who was not involved in the research. “You can only get this kind of information when you run these kinds of simulations and explore different variables, and that’s what they did. This is the payoff.”The model showed, for example, that wearing a belt on top of the mail coat would distribute the weight of the chain links more evenly and prevent it from shifting in combat. And it was roomy and stretchy enough to accommodate a thick felt undergarment for extra padding and protection in battle.Because most mail recovered from archaeological excavations is fragmented and often badly corroded or damaged, the Vimose coat was a perfect proof-of-concept. As one of the best-preserved coats of mail in the world, it’s “a great choice of piece to feature in such experimentation,” says Jonathan Coulston, an archaeologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who was not involved in the research.In the future, the researchers hope to apply their technique to other samples of mail armor from the distant past. “Based on just two or three well-preserved rings,” Wijnhoven says, “we can reconstruct the entire weave.”That, in turn, could offer insights into the priorities of ancient armorers and their clients. Did they make their mail heavy and stiff, prioritizing protection? Or did they prefer light and flexible weaves? “It’s possible to test things in virtual reality we would never be able to test in real life,” Wijnhoven says. “Can you sit on a horse with it? Can you run around with it?”The work could be “very helpful,” Coulston says. “It would be interesting to see … how far it could be applied not just to movement while worn, but for studies in actual protection against missiles and edged/concussive weapons, to measure blunt and sharp-force trauma.”Although it started as a proof-of-concept for the computer simulation, the research is already yielding new insights. The simulation suggests the Germanic warrior who once wore the Vimose mail favored flexibility, choosing large, thin rings that resulted in a lightweight coat of armor.And their close inspection revealed something else. Wijnhoven says archaeologists used to think “barbarians” beyond the borders of the Roman empire weren’t sophisticated enough to make their own mail, instead relying on imported armor or gear looted from Roman legions.But the neck opening of the Vimose mail was fastened with an ingenious strap system on either side of the neck that made it possible to widen or narrow the opening, altering the fit at the same time. “It’s a unique feature not found in the Roman Empire,” Wijnhoven says. “That alone tells us a lot about technology and society.”The technique, meanwhile, could feed back into video games or movie special effects, allowing designers to realistically depict armor on screens big and small as video game platforms get powerful enough to handle the intense computing required. And someday, Wijnhoven hopes, it might arrive at a museum near you.“How cool would it be to fit yourself out digitally with this clothing?” he asks.",
"Two soldiers clung to their overturned boat, roiled by the frigid waters of Rhode Island’s Newport harbor. It was March 1869, and rough weather had turned a pleasure expedition into a perilous disaster. The vessel’s owner had already drowned, and the two men, who were headed back to nearby Fort Adams after a leave, were likely next.But help was on the way in the form of 27-year-old Idawalley Zoradia Lewis. Expertly rowing her wooden skiff, she sighted the men through the New England spring squalls and hauled them into the safety of her boat. It was all in a day’s work for “Ida”, who saved the lives of up to 25 people during her 54-year tenure as a lighthouse keeper at Newport’s Lime Rock Lighthouse.Though Lewis gained international celebrity, a Congressional medal, and a reputation as “America’s bravest woman” for her daring rescues, she was just one of hundreds of women who tended lighthouses along United States coasts between the 18th and 20th centuries. As newspapers argued among themselves as to whether Lewis’s rowing a boat or tending a lighthouse on a rocky station was “unladylike,” women watched around the clock for shipwrecks, and climbed cumulative miles of steps to maintain burning lamps during treacherous storms in an era that restricted women’s roles and devalued their labor.“Women have been at the center of lighthouses since they existed,” says Shauna MacDonald, an associate professor in communications at Cape Breton University in Nova Scotia, Canada, who studies women lighthouse keepers.American women have tended lighthouses since colonial times. Hannah Thomas became the United States’ first woman lighthouse keeper in 1776 after taking over the duties of her husband, John, during his service in the Revolutionary War. Though a few—like Ida Lewis—found fame during their lifetimes, the contributions of most women lighthouse keepers were kept in the dark for centuries until modern scholars were able to illuminate their stories.In the 1990s, historian Candace Clifford and her mother, author Mary Louise Clifford, identified nearly 200 women lighthouse keepers and female employees of the U.S. Lighthouse Service, a federal agency that oversaw all lighthouses in the United States. Other women who did the work in conjunction with male partners or family members, or who labored for short periods of time, may number in the hundreds and have yet to be recognized.Lighthouse keeping could be a lonely task, and many outposts were purposely located in remote, even treacherous territory. Lights had to be on at sunset and turned off at sunrise. There were foghorns to blow and assistance to provide to stranded or wrecked mariners. Maintenance was constant. And in the era before electricity, it was even more challenging.The United States’ first lighthouses relied on fires from coal or wood. Then came candles and oil-fueled lamps. The light was reflected through powerful lenses that had to be kept fastidiously clean. Night after night, the keeper had to ascend the stairs and keep the lamps burning.Most women became lighthouse keepers by birth or marriage, or took over their husband’s duties once he fell ill or died. Lighthouses combined home and workplace—and there was plenty of work to go around. “The only way to learn how to keep a lighthouse is to shadow someone and learn how to do it,” says MacDonald. Though some “stag lighthouses” in extremely remote outposts were kept by single men, most other lighthouses were a family affair, involving everyone from children to adults and being passed from generation to generation.Abbie Burgess exemplified the duties—and grit—of girls who grew up around lighthouses. She was 14 years old when her family moved to Matinicus Rock, a barren rock 25 miles off the Maine coast, in 1853. Her father traveled to the mainland for supplies three years later, leaving the women of the family—Burgess, her invalid mother, and three sisters—behind.Disaster struck when a furious winter storm buffeted the rock, delaying her father’s return and leaving the rest of the Burgess family stranded. Seventeen-year-old Abbie Burgess, who had learned the ropes from her father and carefully studied previous keepers’ logs, had worried about how her mother would fare in an intense storm, and insisted she move her bedroom into the sturdier of the two light towers just in case.It turned out to be prescient: During her father’s absence, the Burgess’s home was flooded, then washed away into the Atlantic. Abbie Burgess ended up tending the light alone for a month.“During this time we were without assistance of any male member of our family,” she later wrote. “Though at times greatly exhausted with my labors, not once did the lights fail.”A few years later, the Burgess family left Matinicus Rock. But Abbie had fallen in love with the lighthouse—and its new assistant keeper. She married him and lived and worked in lighthouses until her death in 1892.Like Burgess, many women tended lighthouses into their old age. Harriet Colfax, who kept the Michigan City, Indiana, lighthouse on the shores of Lake Michigan for 43 years, took on the post after a career as a teacher. She lived at the lighthouse with her longtime companion, Ann Hartwell,  and didn’t retire until 1904, when she was 80.When the Chicago Tribune profiled Colfax in that year, the reporter exclaimed: “The dear little, smiling, gentle, courageous lighthouse keeper is so old!” But appearances are deceiving, and Colfax’s job was tough. For most of her career, she tended two lights and braved a narrow, precarious walk out to the second light, often in icy or wind-lashed weather.In the rare interviews and documents they left behind, women lighthouse keepers consistently downplayed their accomplishments. So did the federal government, which oversaw all U.S. lighthouses. Historian Virginia Neal Thomas writes that though about five percent of lighthouse keepers between 1820 and 1859 were female and received equal pay to men, women lighthouse keepers “were for all intents invisible” within the bureaucracy. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, women were routinely pushed out of the job in favor of male candidates, and in 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Service was folded into the military.Today, there is just one female lighthouse keeper—Sally Snowman, a U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary volunteer who watches over Boston Light, a historic lighthouse on Massachusetts Bay. Unlike her forbears, Snowman doesn’t have to keep the lamps lit. That happens thanks to automation, which drove most lighthouse keepers into obsolescence in the 20th century. Automated beacons have now replaced lighthouses altogether, and many historic lighthouses and sites have passed into the hands of museums and preservation organizations, where women, often volunteers, help fuel lighthouse preservation and do much of the work to commemorate women lighthouse keepers.Despite evolving understandings of the women who kept lighthouse lamps burning, says MacDonald, that work must continue. “We haven’t even scratched the surface,” she says. The unfinished work includes better understanding the lighthouse labor of indentured servants, enslaved people, and women of color whose stories have yet to be unearthed. And it will entail looking for the women who are hidden in plain sight—the wives, daughters, servants, and neighbors who helped keep the lights on and pitched in during emergencies, but whose stories are largely untold and unacknowledged.“Clearly there were lots of women in and around lighthouses,” MacDonald says. “We have to stop telling these stories about female lighthouse keepers as if they’re exceptional. These women were not anomalies.”",
"The Famine Queen. The Widow of Windsor. Grandmother of Europe. Queen Vic. In the 19th century, Queen Victoria earned all those nicknames and more—testaments to the enduring influence of her 64-year (1837-1901) reign over the United Kingdom.During the period now known as the Victorian Era, she oversaw her nation’s industrial, social, and territorial expansion and became known as a trendsetter who made over European attitudes toward the monarchy. An estimated one in four people on Earth were subjects of the British Empire by the end of her rule. But when Victoria took the throne, the British monarchy was deeply unpopular.Victoria was the product of a succession crisis in England’s royal family that occurred when Princess Charlotte, the presumptive successor to King George, and her infant son died in childbirth. Charlotte’s brothers—all of whom were single and had given the monarchy a bad name with their profligate spending and messy personal lives—raced to produce an heir. One of those brothers, Edward, hastily married a widowed German princess and became the first to produce an heir. Born in 1819, Alexandrina Victoria was a direct successor to the crown.Palace intrigue made for a miserable childhood. Victoria’s father died when she was a child, and her ambitious mother allied herself with the scheming Sir John Conroy, a member of the royal household who seized the chance to gain power and influence through the future queen. He created what became known as “the Kensington system,” an elaborate set of rules that isolated the young princess at Kensington Palace and put him in control of her education and upbringing. Designed to keep Victoria dependent and loyal to Conroy and her mother, the system resulted in an unhappy childhood—and a growing sense of resentment.Victoria broke free in 1837, when she turned 18 and rose to the throne. As soon as she became queen, she banned Conroy from her court and marginalized her mother. In 1840, she married her cousin Albert, a German prince. It was a genuine love match—she wrote that her wedding night was “bliss beyond belief”—and they went on to have nine children.During her early reign, Victoria was heavily influenced by Lord Melbourne, the prime minister, and Albert, who was her closest political advisor and whom some historians believe was “king in all but name.” Together, they pursued an agenda of modernization and stability in an era of political upheaval. The monarchy’s reputation had been badly damaged by Victoria’s predecessors, and the British populace clamored to replace the monarchy with a republic. And in Ireland, the potato famine between 1845 and 1852 fomented outright rebellion.Together with her husband, Victoria faced those challenges head-on, working to strengthen the position of the monarchy in England and throughout Europe, where there was also a growing distaste for royals who expected the public to foot the bill for their lavish lifestyles. In contrast, Victoria expanded the monarch’s public role, supporting charities, the arts, and civic reform to counter the view that British royalty wasn’t worth the expense. As a result, the queen and her growing family became beloved celebrities and influenced popular culture, introducing England to everything from white wedding dresses to Christmas trees.In 1861, tragedy struck when Albert died at 42. Victoria was devastated and went into deep mourning. She wore black for the rest of her life and withdrew from the public eye for years. The republican movement grew during her isolation, and she was criticized for her absence from public life.Victoria resumed her public duties by the late 1860s. Her later reign was largely devoted to encouraging peace in Europe and expanding and consolidating her massive political empire. She became Empress of India in 1877 and influenced foreign relations closer to home through her children and grandchildren, many of whom married into European royalty.At the beginning of her monarchy, Britain was seen largely as a trading power. But under Victoria, it became a mighty empire and the world’s most powerful nation. Over the course of the 19th century, it grew by 10 million square miles and 400 million people. Those gains came at a tremendous price: England was almost constantly at war during Victoria’s reign, and the colonialism practiced in her name involved brutal subjugation.Though Victoria was popular, her subjects still pushed to reform the monarchy. Ultimately, this led to an erosion of the monarch’s direct political power as ordinary British people gained the vote, the secret ballot, and other political reforms in the mid- to late 1800s.Queen Elizabeth II opens a session of the Parliament of Canada in Ontario with Prince Philip at her side. Britain's reigning monarch is also Canada's head of state, a government structure left over from when the region was under British rule, and the queen has visited Canada more than any other country during her reign.By her death in 1901, Victoria was an institution, known for her willpower and the vast empire she ruled. The British Empire covered a full fifth of the Earth’s surface and had become the preeminent superpower of its day.Victoria’s attempts to bolster European monarchies by marrying off her family members achieved short-term peace, but they sowed the seeds of some of the 20th century’s most destructive conflicts. By the onset of World War I in 1914, her grandchildren would turn against each other.Although the relentless colonialism of the empire she ruled and the devastating war she inadvertently helped seed now cast a shadow over Victoria’s reign, she believed British power and prosperity were paramount. As she wrote in 1899, “We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat; they do not exist.” For a woman born to rule, there was no room for doubt as to her historic destiny—or the might of the empire built in her name.",
"Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain in 1492 on three small ships: the Santa María, the Pinta, and the Niña. The fleet landed in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, as depicted in this painting.Colonialism is defined as “control by one power over a dependent area or people.” It occurs when one nation subjugates another, conquering its population and exploiting it, often while forcing its own language and cultural values upon its people. By 1914, a large majority of the world's nations had been colonized by Europeans at some point.The concept of colonialism is closely linked to that of imperialism, which is the policy or ethos of using power and influence to control another nation or people that underlies colonialism.In antiquity, colonialism was practiced by empires such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, and Phoenicia. These civilizations all extended their borders into surrounding and non-contiguous areas from about 1550 B.C. onward, and established colonies that drew on the physical and population resources of the people they conquered in order to increase their own power.Modern colonialism began during what’s also known as the Age of Discovery. Beginning in the 15th century, Portugal began looking for new trade routes and searching for civilizations outside of Europe. In 1415, Portuguese explorers conquered Ceuta, a coastal town in North Africa, kicking off an empire that would last until 1999.Soon the Portuguese had conquered and populated islands like Madeira and Cape Verde, and their rival nation, Spain, decided to try exploration, too. In 1492, Christopher Columbus began looking for a western route to India and China. Instead, he landed in the Bahamas, kicking off the Spanish Empire. Spain and Portugal became locked in competition for new territories and took over indigenous lands in the Americas, India, Africa, and Asia.England, the Netherlands, France, and Germany quickly began their own empire building overseas, fighting Spain and Portugal for the right to lands they had already conquered. Despite the growth of European colonies in the New World, most countries managed to gain independence during the 18th and 19th century, beginning with the American Revolution in 1776 and the Haitian Revolution in 1781. However, the Eastern Hemisphere continued to tempt European colonial powers.Starting in the 1880s, European nations focused on taking over African lands, racing one another to coveted natural resources and establishing colonies they would hold until an international period of decolonization began around 1914, challenging European colonial empires up to 1975.Colonial powers justified their conquests by asserting that they had a legal and religious obligation to take over the land and culture of indigenous peoples. Conquering nations cast their role as civilizing “barbaric” or “savage” nations, and argued that they were acting in the best interests of those whose lands and peoples they exploited.Despite the power of colonizers who claimed lands that were already owned and populated by indigenous peoples, resistance is an integral part of the story of colonialism. Even before decolonization, indigenous people on all continents staged violent and nonviolent resistance to their conquerors.Colonial governments invested in infrastructure and trade and disseminated medical and technological knowledge. In some cases, they encouraged literacy, the adoption of Western human rights standards, and sowed the seeds for democratic institutions and systems of government. Some former colonies, like Ghana, experienced a rise in nutrition and health with colonial rule, and colonial European settlement has been linked to some development gains.However, coercion and forced assimilation often accompanied those gains, and scholars still debate colonialism’s many legacies. Colonialism’s impacts include environmental degradation, the spread of disease, economic instability, ethnic rivalries, and human rights violations—issues that can long outlast one group’s colonial rule.",
"Canary Islands, SpainFrom the cliffside path that leads down to the sea, about four kilometers away, I come to a halt. This is the spot: a cave, its entrance barely visible. I look up at the looming face of the rock. I sense it staring back at me, beckoning with its stash: hundreds of caves, built over the centuries from the lava flows of Mount Teide. Any one of them could be the cave we’re looking for—here, history has not yet been written.Within this gorge in southern Tenerife, the largest of Spain’s Canary Islands, a stunning cave was found in 1764 by Spanish regent and infantry captain Luis Román. A contemporary local priest and writer described the find in a book on the history of the islands: “A wonderful pantheon has just been discovered,” José Viera y Clavijo wrote. “So full of mummies that no less than a thousand were counted.” And thus the tale of the thousand mummies was born. (Read about the different types of mummies found worldwide.)Few things are more exciting than navigating the ambiguous edge between history and legend. Now, two and a half centuries later, in the gorge known as Barranco de Herques—also called “ravine of the dead” for its funerary caves—we find ourselves in the place that most local archaeologists consider to be the mythical “cave of the thousand mummies.” There are no written coordinates; its location has been passed on by word of mouth among a chosen few. The hikers who venture along the path are oblivious to its existence.In the company of islander friends, I feel privileged to be shown the place where they believe their ancestors once rested. I crouch toward the narrow opening, turn on my headlamp and drop to the ground. To find this hidden realm, we crawl in on our stomachs for a few claustrophobic meters. But there’s a reward for subjecting ourselves to the tight squeeze: a tall, spacious chamber suddenly opens before me, holding the promise of a journey to the island’s past.“As archaeologists we assume that the expression ‘thousand mummies’ was probably an exaggeration, a way to suggest that there were indeed a lot, a whole lot—hundreds,” says Mila Álvarez Sosa, a local historian and Egyptologist. In the darkness, our eyes slowly adjust. We survey the space for the telltale signs of a necropolis in the meandering lava tube, part of an extensive system across the island.These weren’t the first mummies to be unearthed on the island. But according to local lore, a large sepulchral cave like this one held the pantheon of the nine Mencey kings who ruled the islands in precolonial times.The cave’s location was a scrupulously guarded secret. And there was no record of it, which only served to elevate it as the holy grail of Canarian archaeology. Locals maintain they don’t disclose the location in order to protect the memory of their ancestors who rested there, the Guanches, the Indigenous people of this island—no distinct Guanche population remains today. Others say it was lost to a landslide, buried forever. (Go beyond the beaches in the Canary Islands.)What may have been a certainty for those 18th century explorers morphed into legend when the mummies were plucked from their resting place and their location was lost. But the precious few—from that cave and others—that remain intact and are held in museum collections are helping scientists unravel the story about the archipelago: when and where the first inhabitants came from, and how they honored their dead.Tenerife was the last island in the archipelago to fall to the Castilian crown, beginning in 1494. It wasn’t the first confrontation the islanders had with Europeans, but it would be the last. Álvarez Sosa imagines the stark contrast when at the end of the 15th century, the dawn of the Renaissance, soldiers sailed in on ships and wielded swords on horseback. They came face to face with a people just emerging from the Neolithic era, cave dwellers who wore animal skins and used tools made of sticks and stones. “But yet they honored their dead, preparing them for their last trip,” Álvarez Sosa says. “They preserved them.”A fascination with death led the colonists to chronicle the funerary ritual in detail. “That’s what mainly caught the attention of the Castilian conquerors,” says Álvarez Sosa. In particular, they were intrigued by the embalming process—mirlado—that prepared the xaxos, as the Guanche mummies were called, for eternity.The cave walls are silent. Submerged in the darkness, I imagine the awe Luis Román must have felt when, imbued with the spirit of the Enlightenment and accompanied by locals, he entered the necropolis on a mission to retrieve a few specimens for study. He transported the bodies to Europe where, by the 18th century, mummies represented a scientific curiosity as well as a novelty; both scholars and collectors took an interest.I picture the moment Román raised his torch, revealing hundreds of bodies frozen in time. He must have been overcome by a mixture of sacrilege and exhilaration. Curiously the writer who summarized a report of their visit omitted the location. If the intention was to preserve the cave from plunder, he regrettably failed: by 1833 multiple sources confirmed no bodies remained. (Learn more about Egypt's royal mummies.)I stand up and shake the white dust from my hands and knees. My headlamp dimly illuminates the walls. Though I know there’s not even a remote possibility, in my heart I still long to spot a xaxo (pronounced haho) in some nook or cranny, just like Viera y Clavo described.The method for preserving these corpses for their battle against time and nature was surprisingly simple. “It’s the same process you would use with food,” says Álvarez Sosa. “The bodies were treated with dry herbs and lard and were left to dry in the sun and smoked by fire.” It took 15 days to prepare a xaxo, compared with 70 for an Egyptian mummy (40 days to dehydrate in naturally occurring natron salt, then 30 days of embalming in oils and spices before the cavity of the corpse was filled with straw or cloth and wrapped in linen). Another key difference: according to chronicles, for propriety women in the Canary Islands participated in the process, handling female corpses.Later, the family of the deceased handled the xaxo, placing it in a cured and carefully stitched bag made of animal hide—usually goat. The number of hide layers corresponded to the person’s social standing. The practice wasn’t limited to Tenerife. Mummies have also been found on neighboring Gran Canaria island, decorated with etchings or painted in multiple hues, wrapped in a reed mat, and then deposited in hollow tree trunks. Corpses also have been found there in funerary caves.“We still have many questions—and few samples to study,” says archaeologist María García, curator at the Institute of Bioanthropology in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. She’s painstakingly catalogued the history, dates, and origin of the remains of the 30 or so xaxos in the institute’s drawers. In this immaculate morgue, the bodies of men, women, and children slumber in repose, just steps from one of the city’s thriving thoroughfares, Noria Street. These xaxo remnants were found by hikers and shepherds across sites in Tenerife. So the question lingers: What happened to the ‘thousand mummies’? Or was it all a fabrication?“It was systematic plunder,” María García says bluntly. “During the 17th and 18th centuries the mummies were a lure for the European cultured classes. Our xaxos traveled around the world to be placed in museums and private collections, and some were even ground into aphrodisiac powders.”Others might have ended up at the bottom of the sea, Álvarez Sosa posits in her book Tierras de Momias (Lands of Mummies), probably thrown overboard when balmy conditions on the ship activated the decomposition process during the trip to the Continent. (What surprising new clues are revealing about ancient bog mummies.)Despite having the intact Guanche mummy and remains of three dozen more, we know very little about their tombs. “No archaeologist has ever found a xaxo in its original environment,” María García explains.This is not the first time I traveled to the Canaries seeking answers. Eight years ago I rappelled down a cliff face in the gorge, peering into a dozen caves in search of the legend. I reread 15th- and 16th-century chronicles and interviewed experts to unravel the origins of the early Canarians.These were the mythical Fortunate Isles where ancient Mediterranean seafarers had once landed. The Europeans who later encountered the islands in the Middle Ages found that unlike other Atlantic archipelagos, these islands were inhabited, their populations seemingly isolated for centuries.Chronicles spoke of tall Caucasians, which sowed the seeds for now refuted hypotheses: they alternately descended from shipwrecked Basque, Iberian, Celtic, or Viking sailors. I left the island without coming much closer to any answers. But now modern technology has put an end to the enigma that lasted for centuries. The mummies have spoken.If the place I'm now exploring is the cave described by Viera y Clavijo, this is where the mummy at the top began its long voyage. The circuitous tale begins in 1764, when it was shipped to Madrid as a gift to King Charles III for the court to take in the workmanship of the Guanches in sending their dead to eternity. In 1878 it was on exhibit at the Paris World’s Fair, before it was returned to Madrid, where it lay for over a century in what is today the National Museum of Anthropology. In 2015 it came to its current resting place, the city’s National Archaeology Museum. One night in June 2016 under tight security the mummy was taken on its shortest outing ever: to a nearby hospital for a CT scan.“We had already had CT scans of several Egyptian mummies,” says Javier Carrascoso, associate chief of radiology at Madrid’s QuirónSalud University Hospital, which offered to extend the technology to the Guanche mummy. The scan provided data that debunked a hypothesis that they had simply dehydrated naturally as well as the theory that the Guanche mummification process was derived from Egypt, some 3,000 miles away. (Learn how mummies show clues to ancient diseases.)“It was impressive,” says Carrascoso. “The Guanche mummy was much better preserved than the Egyptian [ones].” The definition of its muscles could still be observed, and the hands and feet in particular were outlined in detailed relief. “It looked like a wooden sculpture of Christ,” he says.But the most remarkable finding was hidden: unlike its Egyptian counterpart, the Guanche mummy had not been eviscerated. Its organs, including the brain, were perfectly intact thanks to a mixture—minerals, aromatic herbs, bark of pine and heather, and resin from its native dragon tree—that halted bacteria and thus decay, inside and out. Radiocarbon dating in 2016 revealed a tall, healthy male, perhaps a member of the elite, given the condition of his hands, feet, and teeth.He was probably between 35 and 40 years old when he died around 800 to 900 years ago, well before the Castilians arrived. The spine showed a dysmorphia common among North African populations, and his facial features also pointed to the neighboring continent.Rosa Fregel, a researcher at the University La Laguna in Tenerife who has studied the islands’ early populations for years, applied the latest DNA sequencing techniques to remains of 40 xaxos. The findings correlated with earlier testing, leaving no doubt about the mummies’ kinship with North Africans: the first inhabitants came from the Maghreb—the continent’s northernmost reaches along the Mediterranean. That doesn’t mean they came from the same place or at the same time. “We’ve discovered that the populations in each of the islands have their own peculiarities,” she explains, so the archipelago wasn’t necessarily homogeneous.Etymology, epigraphy, and ethnohistoric sources had already pointed to African origins, and science now concurs. Centuries before the arrival of Islam to the region, North Africa was inhabited by Numidian clans. The Greeks and Romans disdained them as Berbers—“barbarians”—while the Numidians called themselves Amazigh, or “free men.” They were farmers and animal breeders, and some arrived in the archipelago with their trades and their domestic animals. Why did they abandon their homes in North Africa? And how did they reach these islands, about a hundred kilometers from the coast?“We have always talked about waves of immigration,” says Teresa Delgado, curator of the Canarian Museum in Las Palmas. “But maybe it was just groups of families arriving at different times. Maybe events in North Africa, from Roman rule until the arrival of Islam, triggered periods of migration.”According to José Farrujia, an archaeology and history professor at the University of La Laguna in Tenerife, seven of the eight islands have been continuously inhabited at least for the last 10 centuries. Their populations shared physical traits, and their now extinct languages evolved from Libyan Berber. Farrujia also points out that cave paintings found in the archipelago are similar to ones found in Western Sahara, Algeria, and Morocco’s Atlas Mountains.But the consensus stops there. Historians have put forth various emigration theories. According to one scenario, the islands’ first inhabitants were banished Berber rebels brought to the islands between 25 B.C. and 25 A.D. during the Berber revolt against Rome. “Roman law used banishment to the islands as a punishment,” says Antonio Tejera Gaspar, who’s written about the clash. “Ever since the fall of Carthage, the whole region became a powder keg.”The king who banished the rebels, he believes, was Juba II. Many historians agree that Juba II, son of the defeated Numibian king Juba I, discovered the Canaries. He was educated in Rome and married Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Cleopatra and Marc Antony. In an effort to assimilate the population, Augustus put the couple in charge of Mauritania, which extended from today’s Tunisia to Western Sahara. A scholar, writer, and naturalist, king Juba widely explored his territory and some outliers: According to an account in Pliny the Elder’s Natural History, Juba’s chronicles—since lost—note an expedition to the Fortunate Isles in 46 B.C.It’s the first time the islands are named, and he refers to one of them as Canary. He describes the natural features of each of the islands. “And if he does not mention their people it’s because they were not inhabited,” Tejera Gaspar says. That would come within the next century, when Rome banished the insurrectionists, he notes. Tejera Gaspar argues that the colonists weren’t after resources or riches since the islands lacked both.Or maybe not. Another theory emerged after the 2012 discovery of pottery shards on the small island of Lobos, suggesting that early colonizers may have frequented the islands for their natural resources. Archaeologists uncovered pots, lanterns, hooks, and harpoons, imported and made of non-native materials, including some originating in Andalusia—artifacts typically found along the western Mediterranean trade routes. Shellfish deposits found in the same area led some researchers to believe that seasonal workers landed in temporary settlements to harvest Stramonita haemastoma, a mollusk used to make the prized Tyrian purple dye, reserved for Roman emperors.“A workshop to produce the purple dye demonstrates that the archipelago was within the Roman sphere, that the territory had been explored,” explains María del Carmen del Arco, an archaeologist at the Lobos site, which has been dated to the Roman period. She also points out that Roman ships could have transported new biological stock in the form of animals, plants, and people. (Read how South American cultures made their own mummies.)Still, Carmen del Arco says Pliny the Elder mentions an earlier population predating the Roman era, and archaeology backs up those dates. Some sites in Tenerife have been dated to the 6th century B.C. and in La Palma, the 3rd century B.C. “It all makes sense, especially if we consider that the islands were populated from east to west, from the nearest to the farthest from the African coast,” says José Farrujia.Farrujia describes cave paintings on several of the islands depicting boats similar to the Phoenician ones. “Nothing tells us that they did not know how to sail,” says Farrujia. “There probably were boats, but perishable materials do not leave archaeological traces.” It’s also likely that people might have been enslaved and brought involuntarily by boat, which then departed.Some scholars maintain radiocarbon dating on these sites is inconclusive. And human remains found on the islands so far do not predate the 4th century A.D., as Conrado Rodriguez, director of Tenerife’s Museum of Nature and Archaeology notes. The confirmation of the ancestry of the early inhabitants has renewed archaeology efforts, which may turn up evidence.Who are we? Ultimately everything comes down to a quest to understand our origins. The answer may lie within an unexplored cave, a necropolis, an etching. The island’s topography—its gullies and ravines, hardened lava flows, caves, and windblown sands—helps preserve those secrets.I turn off my headlamp and find refuge in the absolute silence that shelters me like a uterus. I feel no cold, no heat, no fear. I have come seeking answers, and I take away the gift of knowing that questions still remain. My colleagues, all Canarians, produce an old ceramic bowl they call a ganigo, similar to the ones from which the Guanches drank milk to seal their pacts. They ask me a simple question: Do you swear not to tell anyone the location of this cave?In the darkness I cannot see their eyes, yet I know they are shining with the same excitement as mine. With them and the souls that for centuries populated this cave as my witnesses, I answer: Yes, I swear.",
"Spelunkers rappel 300 feet (90 meters) into the Greenland ice sheet. Glacier caves such as these form when seasonal meltwater or geothermal vents cut fissures and channels through an ice sheet. Because they are made of ice, glacier caves can be quite unstable and present unique challenges to spelunkers.A veil of darkness cloaks the natural beauty of caves. Some are found in cliffs at the edge of the coastline, chipped away by the relentless pounding of waves. Others form where a lava tube's outer surface cools and hardens and the inside of the molten rock drains away. Caves even form in glaciers where meltwater carves tunnels at the beginning of its journey to the sea.But most caves form in karst, a type of landscape made of limestone, dolomite, and gypsum rocks that slowly dissolve in the presence of water with a slightly acidic tinge. Rain mixes with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as it falls to the ground and then picks up more of the gas as it seeps into the soil. The combination is a weak acidic solution that dissolves calcite, the main mineral of karst rocks.The acidic water percolates down into the Earth through cracks and fractures and creates a network of passages like an underground plumbing system. The passages widen as more water seeps down, allowing even more water to flow through them. Eventually, some of the passages become large enough to earn the distinction of "cave". Most of these solutional caves require more than 100,000 years to widen large enough to hold a human.The water courses down through the Earth until it reaches the zone where the rocks are completely saturated with water. Here, masses of water continually slosh to and fro, explaining why many caverns lay nearly horizontal.Hidden in the darkness of caves, rock formations called speleothems droop from the ceilings like icicles, emerge from the floor like mushrooms, and cover the sides like sheets of a waterfall. Speleothems form as the carbon dioxide in the acidic water escapes in the airiness of the cave and the dissolved calcite hardens once again.The icicle-shaped formations are called stalactites and form as water drips from the cave roof. Stalagmites grow up from the floor, usually from the water that drips off the end of stalactites. Columns form where stalactites and stalagmites join. Sheets of calcite growths on cave walls and floor are called flowstones. Other stalactites take the form of draperies and soda straws. Twisty shapes called helictites warp in all directions from the ceiling, walls, and floor.",
"Throughout the 1800s, the new archaeological discipline of Egyptology fed a keen public appetite for stories about pyramids and mummies. An 1869 story by Louisa May Alcott, “Lost in a Pyramid,” recounts an archaeologist bringing down a curse on himself when he destroys the mummy of a young girl. “I sometimes wonder if I am to share the curse,” recounts his assistant later, “For I’ve a vein of superstition in me, and that poor little mummy haunts my dreams still.”Mummies have haunted popular culture ever since. By the time of Howard Carter’s discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb in 1922, the idea of a “mummy’s curse” was already well established in early cinema. Mummies have been Hollywood staples since horror superstar Boris Karloff starred in The Mummy in 1932. The 1999 movie The Mummy and its sequel The Mummy Returns continued the trend of the mummy as a tormented, vengeful being caught somewhere between life and death.circa 3000 B.C.Before this date, the dead are generally buried in desert graves, whose sands dry and preserve the bodies.2572-2130 B.C.In the Old Kingdom, some pharaohs are buried in large pyramids. Mummification is developed so that the royal bodies do not decompose.1938-1630 B.C.During the Middle Kingdom, mummification is extended to the wider population and varies in complexity according to clients’ budgets.1552-1069 B.C.Techniques are perfected during the New Kingdom, a period in which it also becomes customary to bury papyri with mummies.664-332 B.C.During the Late Period, there is a boom in mummified animals. Many of them are given to the gods as offerings.2nd century A.D.Mummification disappears with the spread of Christianity. A new set of beliefs about the afterlife takes hold.Why did the Ancient Egyptians develop this costly, and to contemporary eyes, ghoulish ritual? Only by stripping away modern associations can the significance of mummies be understood. Objects of awe and mystery, they were created out of respect both for the gods and the deceased, and regarded as a natural continuation of the journey after death.Mummification has deep roots in Egypt’s climate and geography. The oldest mummies date back to the fourth millennium B.C. and received no elaborate preservation at all. At that time, bodies were buried without any kind of casket in the desert, where conditions dried and preserved the remains. As customs changed in early Egyptian society, bodies began to be placed inside caskets and tombs. Separating bodies from the ground inhibited the corpses’ drying out, so Egyptians began to develop techniques to preserve bodies before burial.These techniques were closely connected with religious beliefs, which described people as an amalgam of elements. Some of these were material: a person’s body, shadow, and name. Others were associated with their spirit: the ka, or cosmic energy received at birth; the ankh, or vital breath; and the ba, the personality. These elements were momentarily separated when a person died—a source of much anguish to the Egyptian mind. Mummification allowed the spirit of the deceased to recognize its own body, joyfully return to it, and be reborn.The ritual mirrored the story of Osiris, god of the underworld, who was killed by his brother, Seth. Osiris’s murderer scattered his body parts across the land. Only when his consort Isis intervened, reuniting and burying the fragments, could Osiris be restored to life. In Egyptian art Osiris is often mummified, a task carried out by the god Anubis. The myth underscores how Egyptians believed the soul had no hope to navigate the hereafter unless its body was whole.When the Greek historian Herodotus toured Egypt in the middle of the fifth century B.C., he took a keen interest in mum­mification techniques, which he described in some detail in his Histories. His account also mentions a curious anecdote about “wooden models of corpses” at high so­ciety banquets.“In social gatherings among the rich, when the banquet is ended, a ser­vant carries round to the several guests a coffin in which there is a wooden image of a corpse, carved and painted to resemble nature as nearly as possible, about a cubit or two in length [17 to 34 inches]. As he shows it to each guest in turn, the servant says, ‘Gaze here, and drink and be merry; for when you die, such will you be.’”Initially, mummification was the exclusive preserve of royalty and the court. During the period of the Old Kingdom (ca 2575-2130 B.C.), there was only one team of royal embalmers, who mummified members of the pharaoh’s family, courtiers, and officials to whom the monarch granted that privilege. Later, the ritual became more widespread, and independent workshops were set up. The “democratization” of mummies brought market realities into play, and levels of craftsmanship would vary widely depending on how much customers were able to pay.Even so, embalmers from all workshops were regarded as qualified professionals. Since they possessed anatomical knowledge and had to carry out a series of rituals, they were seen as both doctors and members of the priestly social class.Various papyri have been found that detail the different professionals involved in the process. One of the most notable was the “Lord of Secrets” (hery sesheta), who performed the rituals wearing a mask of Anubis, the god of embalming believed to have carried out the mummification of Osiris himself.There were also lector priests (hery heb), who read aloud the instructions for the ritual and magic spells as the dressings were applied. Meanwhile, the cutters removed the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines from the incision in the side of the corpse. Their social status was the lowest due to the impurity associated with the ritual.The embalmers performed their task during a long time phase between death and burial, which normally lasted over 70 days, although there are records of even longer periods. One account tells how the 4th-dynasty queen Meresankh III, wife of Pharaoh Khafre (the builder of the second of the great Pyramids at Giza), was not buried until 274 days after her death.Writing in the fifth century B.C., the Greek historian Herodotus observed how when the mourning period had ended, the body was given to the embalmers and “whenever a corpse was conveyed to them, they showed those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting.” Once a price had been agreed upon, the embalmer’s work would begin.Mummification was a complex and expensive procedure, in part because it required so many products. Although Egyptologists have not been able to identify all of these with complete certainty, here are the top eight essential ingredients to making the perfect mummy.1. NATRON AND OINTMENTS Natron was the main ingredient used to dry out the dead body, but embalmers applied oils such as cedar, and perhaps juniper oil, to maintain the suppleness of the flesh.2. RESIN The importance of resin was mentioned in the Admonitions of Ipuwer, a text from the Old Kingdom: “None shall sail northward to Byblos today; what shall we do for cedar trees for our mummies?”3. LICHEN AND ONIONS Onions were sometimes used to fill the body’s cavities, often serving as false eyes. Lichen has been found in the abdomens of Siptah and Ramses IV.4. SAWDUST, STRAW, SAND, AND RAGS... All of these materials were used to fill the body’s cavities during the 21st dynasty. Sawdust was also spread on the skin to aid the drying process.5. SPICES It has not been scientifically proven that spices were used in mummification. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus allude to cassia and cinnamon from India, Ceylon, and China.6. BEESWAX Wax has sometimes been found sealing the mouth, nasal passages, and other cavities in mummies from the New Kingdom and the Late Period. Bees were valued for their magical properties.7. INCENSE AND MYRRH Myrrh from Somalia and the south of Arabia was used to fill and anoint the body, and its fragrance was highly valued. Incense was used to fumigate the body, and in funerary rites.8. PALM WINE According to Herodotus, palm wine was used to clean bodily cavities, but so far no archaeological evidence has been found for this practice.The first stage was carried out quite quickly, since decomposition occurred rapidly in the intense Egyptian heat. The purification ritual for the deceased took place over three days in a temporary structure called an ibw, where the body was washed. Once the body had been purified, it was taken to the wabet (pure place) or per nefer (house of beauty), where the actual mummification began.According to Herodotus, the embalmers started their work by emptying the corpse’s head. The ancient Egyptians did not see the brain as the center of reason and identity, so they made no effort to preserve it. A long hook was inserted up the nose into the cranium and swirled around to liquefy the brain, which would then be poured out into a bowl.Next, the internal organs were removed through an incision, usually made in the left-hand side of the abdomen. But the heart, believed to be the center of wisdom, was deliberately left in place. Spells 27, 28, and 29 in the collection of mortuary texts known now as the Book of the Dead state the importance of keeping this organ connected to the body.Dehydration was essential to the embalming process. The material used was solid-state natron, a hydrated sodium carbonate often found near salt lakes. Immersed in this mixture for a period of 40 days, the body’s cavities filled with the substance and dried out from the inside. In an experiment performed on a corpse in 1994, Egyptologist Bob Brier and Dr. Ronald Wade found that 580 pounds of natron were needed to entirely cover and dry a body.Various oils and liquid resin were later rubbed into the flesh. This may have helped prevent or delay insect predation and mask the odors of decomposition. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus visited Egypt in the first century B.C. and observed the mummification process: “They carefully dress the whole body for over 30 days, first with cedar oil and certain other preparations, and then with myrrh, cinnamon, and such spices as have the faculty not only of preserving it for a long time but also of giving it a fragrant odor.”Once mummification was complete, the deceased would be carried to his or her final resting place. A large procession set out from the home. Servants and relatives car­ried offerings of food, flowers, and furniture. The chest bearing canopic jars containing the dead person’s internal organs was car­ried on one sled and a casket containing the mummy was pulled on another.After reaching the tomb, the procession was received by muu dancers, hired to per­form at funerals. The casket was placed up­ right before the tomb by a priest wearing the mask of Anubis. Before the burial began, a funerary priest addressed the corpse, as part of the solemn ritual known as the Opening of the Mouth: “Your mouth now works, I have opened your mouth for you, I have opened your eyes for you.”The key trait of the mummy is its linen wrappings, often the last step of mummification. This final procedure was carried out with great solemnity, the wrappers taking many days to entirely envelop the body. The amount of fabric used varied from one mummy to another and, in the case of less well-off clients, belonged to the deceased in their lifetimes. Every single action was defined in minute detail and accompanied by the appropriate spell. Amulets of various kinds were placed inside the folds of the linen to provide greater protection, as well as papyri with magic spells.If the deceased was a member of the elite, the mummy was covered with a mask and placed in a sumptuous casket, which was in turn placed inside a sarcophagus. A funerary procession carried the sarcophagus to the tomb, the “house of eternity,” where the body of the deceased, now properly fitted out for the rigors of the afterlife, could rejoin the elements of its soul and be born again.In the early 1880s, officials in Luxor suspected that mummies were being sold illegally, and following an investigation, they stumbled on a cache that shocked Egyptologists. In 1881, tipped off by a local dealer, the German archaeologist Emil Brugsch entered a cave set into a cliff face near Deir el Bahri. By the light of his candle he found the “many famous personages of whom we never expected to know more than their names,” including the remains of two of the most powerful New Kingdom pharaohs: Ramses II and Thutmose III, whose mummy was badly damaged by grave robbers. The mummies were later taken to Cairo where they were unwrapped before onlookers by Brugsch and other Egyptologists. The two great kings now rest in the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
"Tollund Man, who was hanged with a leather cord and cast into a Danish bog, is housed at Denmark's Silkeborg Museum.Cast into northern European wetlands, bog bodies have long appeared as opaque to archaeologists as their dark and watery graves. But new clues are coming in the centuries-old mystery of their origins.Over 500 Iron Age bog bodies and skeletons dating to between 800 B.C. and A.D. 200 have been discovered in Denmark alone, with more unearthed in Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. (Read "Tales From the Bog" in National Geographic magazine.)Much of the bodies' skin, hair, clothes, and stomach contents have been remarkably well preserved, thanks to the acidic, oxygen-poor conditions of peat bogs, which are made up of accumulated layers of dead moss.Tollund Man, for example, found in 1950 on Denmark's Jutland Peninsula and perhaps the most famous bog body in the world, still "has this three-day beard—you feel he will open his eyes and talk to you. It's something that not even Tutankhamun could make you feel," said Karin Margarita Frei, a research scientist who studies bog bodies at the National Museum of Denmark.In Denmark, about 30 of these naturally mummified corpses are housed in museums, where scientists have worked for decades to figure out who these people were and why they died.Because some bear horrific wounds, such as slashed throats, and were buried instead of cremated like most others in their communities, scientists have suggested the bodies had been sacrificed as criminals, slaves, or simply commoners. The Roman historian Tacitus started this idea in the first century A.D. by suggesting they were deserters and criminals. (See National Geographic's pictures of bog bodies.)But ongoing research is uncovering an entirely new dimension: When alive, these people of the bog may have instead been special members of their villages, which in the early Iron Age were loosely scattered across Denmark.New chemical analyses applied to two of the Danish bog bodies, Huldremose Woman and Haraldskær Woman, show that they had traveled long distances before their deaths. What's more, some of their clothing had been made in foreign lands and was more elaborate than previously thought."You sacrifice something that is meaningful and has a lot of value. So maybe people who [had] traveled had a lot of value," Frei told National Geographic at the Euroscience Open Forum in Copenhagen in June.Analysis of Huldremose Woman's leather cape and woolen scarf and skirt show that the clothing had been made outside of Denmark.Supernatural Portal?For Europeans dating as far back as the Neolithic period 6,000 years ago, bogs were both resources and possibly ominous supernatural portals, according to Ulla Mannering, an expert in ancient textiles at the National Museum of Denmark.The bogs' peat, which could be burned for heating homes, was valuable in tree-scarce Denmark, and an ore called bog iron was made into tools and weapons.Among prehistoric people, "when you take things, you also offer things," said Mannering.This may be why the Danish villagers would deposit "gifts" of clothes, old shoes, slaughtered animals, battered weapons, and, for a period of 500 years, people into the black abyss of the bogs. (Related: "Medieval Christian Book Discovered in Ireland Bog.")Danish Iron Age cultures left no written records, so their religious beliefs are unknown, Mannering noted."Very Fine Lady"When peat harvesters began accidentally unearthing bog bodies in the mid to late 1800s, many were discovered without clothing, solidifying the view that they had been simple people, Frei said. (Watch a National Geographic Channel video about bog mummies.)Tollund Man, for instance, was found with a belt but no clothes. "It doesn't make sense to be naked and have a belt," Frei pointed out.Frei wondered, then, if some of the bog bodies' clothing had dissolved in the bogs over the centuries. So she decided to examine Huldremose Woman, a mummy discovered in 1879 wearing a checkered skirt and scarf, both made of sheep's wool, and two leather capes.Using microscopes, she discovered that tiny plant fibers were stuck to the 2,300-year-old woman's skin—remnants of ancient underwear, which later analyses revealed were likely made of flax.Next, Frei performed a first-of-its-kind analysis of the strontium isotope contained in the flax and in the wool from the skirt and scarf.Researchers analyzed the isotopes, or different varieties, of atoms in the strontium preserved in the flax and wool fibers. These atoms provide a chemical insight into the geology of the region where the plant and sheep lived.The results show that the plant fibers taken from threads of the underwear grew on terrains geologically older than those of Denmark—those typical of northern Scandinavia, such as Norway or Sweden—suggesting that Huldremose Woman may have come from somewhere else, according to research published in 2009 in the Journal of Archaeological Science.Frei also did an analysis of strontium isotopes in Huldremose Woman's skin. Humans absorb strontium through food and water, and it's especially prevalent in our teeth and bones—though many bog bodies are found without teeth and bones because of the acidic conditions.Haraldskær Woman, who is kept at Denmark's Vejle Museum, was first thought to be a Norwegian queen.The research revealed that Huldremose Woman's body contained strontium atoms from locales outside Denmark—showing she had traveled abroad before she ended up in the bog. (See "Pictures: Ancient Bog Girl's Face Reconstructed.")Another study published in 2009 by Mannering revealed that Huldremose Woman's woolen garments—turned brown by the bog—were originally blue and red: Dyed clothing is a sign of wealth, she says. Mannering and colleagues also found a ridge in Huldremose Woman's finger that may have indicated it once bore a gold ring before it disintegrated in the bog."At first we thought this must be a witch—now we think she's a very fine lady with expensive jewelry and expensive clothes and underwear," Frei said."It had been overlooked that there is such a wealth of resource in these textiles and skin," Mannering added.What's more, the research shows that early Iron Age cultures of the centuries just before and after Christ were more interconnected than thought, Frei said.For instance, wool and plant fibers were either traded or brought as raw materials for textiles more commonly and over longer distances than previously assumed, according to Frei's research."This was seen as a period where society was very closed—not much trade with the outside world," she said. "Suddenly we can see, yes, there was."Lotte Hedeager, an expert in Iron Age archaeology at the University of Oslo in Norway, agreed, noting that "these results require a rethinking" of the communication and trade networks among northern European cultures in the early Iron Age.The Hair Has ItBuilding on their discoveries with Huldremose Woman, Frei and colleagues wanted to see if other bodies were outsiders.So they turned to Haraldskær Woman, a bog body housed at the Vejle Museum in Denmark, who was found in 1835 and originally thought to be the Norwegian Queen Gunhild. (Also see "'Frankenstein' Bog Mummies Discovered in Scotland.")New developments in strontium isotope tracing technology make it possible to detect strontium isotopes in human hair, which can show where a person lived over the last few years of his or her life. Since hair grows slowly, analyzing strontium atoms at the root of someone's hair versus the bottom of their hair may reveal geographic movements.The longer the hair, the longer the record of their movements—which makes Haraldskær Woman, with her 20-inch-long locks (50 centimeters), a perfect subject.Excitingly, preliminary results of the analysis, still unpublished, mirror the findings for Huldremose Woman—Haraldskær Woman had lived elsewhere before her death. The scientists are also examining her clothing, which may have been produced in another location."DNA cannot tell you that—it can tell you your genetic makeup, but [not] where you were born, where you had your childhood, where you had the last years of your life," Frei said.Frei and colleagues are now running strontium isotopic analyses on the skin of Tollund Man to see where he'd been before his death.A small part of the bog remains where Tollund Man was found on Denmark's Jutland Peninsula.Geographic OutsidersOther experts agree that the research indicates the bog bodies were people considered unique in their villages.To Heather Gill-Frerking, a mummy researcher for the museum-exhibit company American Exhibitions, the new findings are "really nice evidence" for her theory that bog bodies were what she calls "geographic outsiders"—people who may have married into Danish communities, or had been doing work or apprenticeships abroad.Gill-Frerking has suggested for years that bog bodies weren't the results of some religious rite, but were instead foreigners placed into the bog.These people may not have been cremated like everyone else because they hadn't yet assimilated into their communities, or perhaps because the communities weren't aware of the dead person's burial customs. (She said it's likely some of the bog bodies were buried after they'd died of natural causes.)"I'm a big believer of multiple interpretations of bog bodies, not just [that they were] rituals," she said.If Frei continues to find that those buried in the bog had traveled before their deaths, "we'd need to look hard at the ritual theory and look at bodies as individuals.""Secret of the Bogs"Niels Lynnerup, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Copenhagen who has studied bog bodies, believes that they were sacrificed—but the enigma, he said, revolves around why.The new discoveries that at least one of the bodies may have been that of a foreigner, he says, "certainly adds to that discussion of, 'Who were the people who were sacrificed?'" (See "Murdered 'Bog Men' Found With Hair Gel, Manicured Nails.")For instance, Lynnerup suggested that perhaps they had a special status because they came from abroad or were hostages of raiding parties into other areas.It's also possible that, as was the case with some Inca sacrifices, the person considered it an honor to be chosen and voluntarily went to the bog."Having the additional information that at least one of them was not local is terribly important, and [it] will be highly interesting to see if this pattern goes on."Overall, the archaeologists acknowledged it's likely there will always be more questions than answers when it comes to mysterious bog bodies.Added the University of Oslo's Hedeager: "We will never be able to uncover the perception of life and death of those individuals 2,000 years ago."That remains a true secret of the bogs."Follow Christine Dell'Amore on Twitter and Google+.",
"This perfectly preserved baby from Peru was born with a heart defect.Whether laid to rest in a simple grave or a grand tomb, the human body rarely survives the sweep of time. But in a few places where people deliberately mummified their dead, or the environmental conditions were right—very dry or wet—flesh and bone are preserved.Today these remains, probed by modern CT scans, MRIs, and DNA tests, are offering intriguing insights into how people lived and died long ago.A 2011 study of 52 mummies in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo showed that almost half had clogged arteries, the kind of condition that can lead to a heart attack or stroke.What was to blame? Too much beer and bread? Not enough exercise? Chronic inflammation? Or perhaps some genetic predisposition of the interbred royals? Experts could only wonder.As it turns out, those ancient Egyptians weren't alone. Recent CT scans of 137 mummies from four different regions, spanning more than 4,000 years, revealed that one-third had clogged arteries.Again, the experts are stumped. But the new mummy studies got us thinking: What else have we learned about the history of disease from ancient human remains?Herewith, a selectively macabre list:1. Millennia of maladies—With more known mummies than any other place on Earth, ancient Egypt is a hypochondriac's nightmare.2. Lingering cough—Tuberculosis has plagued humans for millennia. The world's oldest cases involving modern humans turned up in the remains of a mother and child who lived about 9,000 years ago and were discovered on the ocean floor beneath 30 feet of water off the coast of Haifa, Israel.3. Pain in the gut—Stomach ulcers aren't just a phenomenon of the stressed modern world. DNA from Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes the problem, has been found in Mexican mummies from about A.D. 1350.4. Toxic metal—Signs of cirrhosis were discovered in the mummy of a 16th-century Italian man. Since the deceased was only about 24 years old, he couldn't have been drinking and damaging his liver for decades. That suggests Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder in which copper accumulates in the body and affects the liver.5. Cold spots—Smallpox DNA was detected in a 300-year-old frozen mummy from Siberia. The virus caused hundreds of millions of deaths worldwide during the 20th century alone; it wasn't eradicated until 1977, after intensive vaccination campaigns. The genetic information from the mummy's infection could help scientists understand the smallpox epidemics of the past.6. Infant mortality—Some 6,500 years ago in Peru, a ten-month-old baby died. The tiny body was adorned with an amulet hung on a string around its neck, wrapped in linen, and laid in the bone-dry earth, which preserved it perfectly. A recent CT has revealed that the child suffered from a fatal combination: a heart defect and a lung infection.7. Little person—Peat cutters working in a bog in the Netherlands in 1951 uncovered the preserved remains of a woman who may have lived during the Roman period. She likely had Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, a form of dwarfism.8. Public health—And finally, results of a large-scale study involving more than 23,000 skeletons from medieval archaeological sites in Britain:",
"Preserved by one of Earth's driest climates, a long-buried corpse in Chile's Atacama Desert retains centuries-old skin, hair, and clothing (file picture).Naturally  dehydrated corpses like this probably inspired the region's ancient  Chinchorro people to actively mummify their dead, scientists speculate in a new study. The  practice, researchers suggest, took off during a time of natural plenty  and population growth, when the Chinchorro were better able to innovate  and develop culturally.Living in fishing villages along the coasts of Chile and Peru, the Chinchorro had begun mummifying skeletons by 5050 B.C., thousands of years before the Egyptians.  Archaeologists have long wondered how the practice—and a related cult  of death—arose, with some speculating it had been imported from the  notably wetter Amazon Basin (regional map)."Our  study is one of the few to document the emergence of social complexity  due to environmental change"—in this case, climate shifts that  desiccated the Atacama, study leader Pablo Marquet said."Until  now, most of the emphasis has been on how environmental change triggers  the collapse of societies," said Marquet, an archaeologist at Catholic  University in Santiago, Chile.(Read more about the Chinchorro mummies in National Geographic magazine.)—Ker Than",
"Three thousand four hundred years ago, a contentious ancient Egyptian king abandoned his name, his religion, and his capital in Thebes (modern Luxor). Archaeologists know what happened next: The pharaoh Akhenaten built the short-lived city of Akhetaten, where he ruled alongside his wife, Nefertiti and worshipped the sun. After his death, his young son Tutankhamun became ruler of Egypt—and turned his back on his father’s controversial legacy.But why did Akhenaten abandon Thebes, which had been the capital of ancient Egypt for more than 150 years? Answers may lie in the discovery of an industrial royal metropolis within Thebes that Akhenaten inherited from his father, Amenhotep III. The find, which has been dubbed the “lost golden city of Luxor" in an announcement released today, will generate as much enthusiasm, speculation, and controversy as the renegade pharaoh who left it.Because the city was initially discovered just in September of last year, archaeologists have only scratched the surface of the sprawling site, and understanding where this discovery ranks in Egyptological importance is hard to say at this time. The level of preservation found so far, however, has impressed researchers.“There’s no doubt about it; it really is a phenomenal find,” says Salima Ikram, an archaeologist who leads the American University in Cairo’s Egyptology unit. “It’s very much a snapshot in time—an Egyptian version of Pompeii.”The site dates from the era of 18th-dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled between around 1386 and 1353 B.C. and presided over an era of extraordinary wealth, power and luxury. In Amenhotep III’s final years, he is thought to have briefly reigned alongside his son, Akhenaten.But a few years after his father’s death, Akhenaten, who ruled from around 1353–1336, broke with everything the late ruler stood for. During his 17-year reign, he upended Egyptian culture, abandoning all of the traditional Egyptian pantheon but one, the sun god Aten. He even changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten, which means “devoted to Aten.”The heretic pharaoh didn’t stop there. Akhenaten moved his royal seat from Thebes north to a completely new city he called Akhetaten (modern site name: Amarna) and oversaw an artistic revolution that briefly transformed Egyptian art from stiff and uniform to animated and detailed. But after his death, most traces of the ruler were obliterated. Starting with his son, the boy king Tutankhamun, Akhenaten's capital, his art, his religion, and even his name was dismissed and systematically wiped from history. Only the rediscovery of Amarna in the 18th century revived the legacy of the renegade leader, which has fueled archaeological speculation for hundreds of years.Why and how did the pharaoh’s controversial transformation take place, and what was everyday life like under the great Amenhotep III? The newly found city could provide clues. The excavation site straddles old and new in an area renowned for its archaeological riches. To the north is Amenhotep III’s 14th-century B.C. mortuary temple, and to the south is Medinet Habu, a mortuary temple built almost two centuries later for Ramses III.Archaeologists had hoped the space between might be the site of the mortuary structure where Tutankhamun’s subjects would have placed the food and funerary items they offered him when he died around 1325 B.C. Instead, they uncovered something very different: zigzagging mudbrick walls up to nine feet high and piles of ancient artifacts from the era of Amenhotep III.Structures are packed with everyday items, many of which relate to the artistic and industrial production that supported the pharaoh’s capital city. There are homes where workers might have lived, a bakery and kitchen, items related to metal and glass production, buildings that appear related to administration, and even a cemetery filled with rock-cut tombs.Though the size of the city has yet to be determined, its date is clear thanks to hieroglyphics on a variety of items. A vessel containing two gallons of boiled meat was inscribed with the year 37—the time of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten’s speculated father-son reign. Scarabs, bricks, vessels, and more bear Amenhotep III’s royal seal.The buildings also bear his soon-to-be heretic son’s name, says Betsy Bryan, a professor of Egyptian art and archaeology at Johns Hopkins University. Bryan, who was not involved in the dig, visited on a day when archaeologists found a small clay ceiling stamped with hieroglyphs that said ‘The aten is found living on truth.’ "That’s an epithet of Akhenaten,” Bryan notes. Despite references to the younger king, though, she says the city is part of his father’s palace complex to the north, which was named Nebmaatre or “the Dazzling Aten.”Once Akhenaten came into power and changed course, he left his father’s city, and seemingly everything it contained, behind.That loss is modern archaeology’s gain. “It’s extraordinarily beautiful,” says Ikram. She recalls walking through the preserved streets, surrounded by tall walls where, she says, she expected an ancient Egyptian to come around the corner at any moment. “I don’t think you can oversell it,” she says. “It is mind-blowing.”The city appears to have been reused by Tutankhamun, who ditched Akhetaten during his reign but established a new capital at Memphis. Ay, who later inherited the throne when he married Tut’s widow, seems to have used it, too. Four distinct settlement layers at the site show eras of use all the way into the Coptic Byzantine era of the third through seventh centuries A.D.Then, it was left to the sands until its recent discovery.But why was it abandoned during the brief reign of Akhenaten? “I don’t know that we’ll get closer to answering that question through this particular city,” says Bryan. “What we will get is more and more information about Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, and their families. It’s early days, but I think we’ll see more and more connections.” Though the newly discovered city may not give up clues to the mystery of the rebel pharaoh, it will paint an even more vivid picture of the life he left behind.",
"Sometimes the most powerful commentary on a king is made by those who are silent. One morning in Amarna, a village in Upper Egypt about 200 miles south of Cairo, a set of delicate, sparrowlike bones were arranged atop a wooden table. “The clavicle is here, and the upper arm, the ribs, the lower legs,” said Ashley Shidner, an American bioarchaeologist. “This one is about a year and a half to two years old.”The skeleton belonged to a child who lived at Amarna more than 3,300 years ago, when the site was Egypt’s capital. The city was founded by Akhenaten, a king who, along with his wife Nefertiti and his son, Tutankhamun, has captured the modern imagination as much as any other figure from ancient Egypt. This anonymous skeleton, in contrast, had been excavated from an unmarked grave. But the bones showed evidence of malnutrition, which Shidner and others have observed in the remains of dozens of Amarna children.“The growth delay starts around seven and a half months,” Shidner said. “That’s when you start transition feeding from breast milk to solid food.” At Amarna this transition seems to have been delayed for many children. “Possibly the mother is making the decision that there’s not enough food.”Until recently Akhenaten’s subjects seemed to be the only people who hadn’t weighed in on his legacy. Others have had plenty to say about the king, who ruled from around 1353 B.C. until 1336 B.C. and tried to transform Egyptian religion, art, and governance. Akhenaten’s successors were mostly scathing about his reign. Even Tutankhamun—whose brief reign has been a subject of fascination since his tomb was discovered in 1922—issued a decree criticizing conditions under his father: “The land was in distress; the gods had abandoned this land.” During the next dynasty, Akhenaten was referred to as “the criminal” and “the rebel,” and pharaohs destroyed his statues and images, trying to remove him from history entirely.Opinion swung to the opposite extreme during modern times, when archaeologists rediscovered Akhenaten. In 1905 Egyptologist James Henry Breasted described the king as “the first individual in human history.” To Breasted and many others, Akhenaten was a revolutionary whose ideas, especially the concept of monotheism, seemed far ahead of his time. And the archaeological record has always been thin enough to allow for excavations of the imagination. Dominic Montserrat, whose Akhenaten book is subtitled History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt, noted that we often take scattered evidence from ancient times and organize it into narratives that make sense in our world. We do this, he wrote, “so that the past could be held up to the present, like a mirror.”That modern mirror of Akhenaten has reflected almost every identity imaginable. The king has been portrayed as a proto-Christian, a peace-loving environmentalist, an out-and-proud homosexual, and a totalitarian dictator. His image was embraced with equal enthusiasm by both the Nazis and the Afrocentrist movement. Thomas Mann, Naguib Mahfouz, and Frida Kahlo all incorporated the pharaoh into their art. When Philip Glass wrote three operas about visionary thinkers, his trinity consisted of Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Akhenaten. Sigmund Freud once fainted during a heated argument with Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung about whether the Egyptian king had suffered from excessive love of his mother. (Freud’s diagnosis: Akhenaten was oedipal, almost a thousand years before Oedipus.)Archaeologists always tried to resist such interpretations, but key pieces of the puzzle were missing. Much study of Amarna has focused on elite culture: royal sculpture and architecture, and inscriptions from the tombs of high officials. For years scholars hoped for the opportunity to study the burial places of common people, knowing that Amarna’s brief window of existence—17 years—meant that a cemetery would provide a rare snapshot of everyday life. But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that a detailed survey of the surrounding desert finally located evidence of four separate cemeteries.After the discovery, archaeologists and bioarchaeologists spent nearly a decade excavating and analyzing the largest of these cemeteries. They collected a sample of skeletons from at least 432 people, and their findings were grim. Of the burials where age at death was known, 70 percent of the individuals had died before reaching 35, and only nine appear to have lived beyond 50. More than one-third were dead before they turned 15. The growth patterns of children were delayed by as much as two years. Many adults had suffered spinal damage, which bioarchaeologists believe is evidence that people were being overworked, perhaps in order to build the new capital.In 2015 the team proceeded to another cemetery, to the north of Amarna, where they excavated 135 bodies. Anna Stevens, an Australian archaeologist who directs the cemetery fieldwork, told me that excavators soon noticed something different about these burials. Many of the bodies appear to have been buried hastily, in graves that contain almost no goods or objects. There isn’t evidence of violent death, but family groupings seem to have broken down; in many cases it looks as if two or three unrelated people were tossed together into a grave. They were young—92 percent of the individuals in this cemetery were no older than 25. More than half died between the ages of seven and 15.“This is very clearly not a normal death curve,” Stevens said. “It may be no coincidence that this area had the king’s limestone quarries. Is this a group of workers who are being conscripted on the basis of their youth—and effectively being worked to death?” In her opinion, one thing is clear: “It absolutely dispels any lingering sense that Amarna was a nice place to live.”For Akhenaten, Amarna represented something pure and profoundly visionary. “No official has ever advised me concerning it,” the king wrote proudly of his founding of the brand-new capital city. He chose the site, a broad stretch of virgin desert above the east bank of the Nile, because it was uncontaminated by the worship of any god.No images of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, or Aten have been found in the commoners’ cemeteries, suggesting that the new religion had yet to be embraced by the masses. Today, though, Egyptians at a Cairo theme park pose in ways that recall the natural, family-oriented style of Amarna art. See how Akhenaten radically transformed centuries of artistic tradition in this detailed graphic.He also may have been motivated by the example of his father, Amenhotep III, who was one of the greatest builders of monuments, temples, and palaces in Egyptian history. Both kings were part of the 18th dynasty, which came to power after defeating the Hyksos, a group from the eastern Mediterranean that had invaded northern Egypt. The forefathers of the 18th dynasty were based in southern Egypt, and in order to drive out the Hyksos, they incorporated key innovations from their enemy, including the horse-drawn chariot and the composite bow. The Egyptians professionalized their military, and unlike most previous dynasties, the 18th maintained a standing army.They were also skilled at diplomacy, and the empire eventually stretched from current-day Sudan to Syria. Foreigners brought new wealth and skills to the Egyptian court, and the effects were profound. Under Amenhotep III, who ruled from around 1390 to 1353 B.C., the style of royal art shifted in ways that would be described today as more naturalistic.Even as Amenhotep III welcomed new ideas, he was also looking back to the distant past. He studied the pyramids of kings who had lived more than a thousand years earlier, and he incorporated traditional elements into festivals, temples, and royal palaces. He continued to worship Amun, who was the patron god of the city of Thebes. But Amenhotep III also began to emphasize Aten, a form of the sun god Re, portrayed as a solar disk, that recalled older patterns of worship.The king’s son took the throne as Amenhotep IV, but during the fifth year of his reign he made two momentous decisions. He changed his name to Akhenaten—Devoted to Aten—and he decided to move the capital to the site now known as Amarna. The king called his city Akhetaten, or Horizon of the Sun Disk, and soon this stretch of empty desert became home to an estimated 30,000 people. Palaces and temples were built quickly, at astonishing scale—the Great Aten Temple, the city’s largest ritual complex, was nearly a half mile long.Meanwhile Egyptian art was also being revolutionized. For centuries strict traditions had defined the correct subject matter, proportions, and poses of paintings and sculptures. Under Akhenaten, artisans were unleashed from these guidelines. They created lifelike, fluid scenes of the natural world, and they began to portray Akhenaten and his queen, Nefertiti, in unusually natural and intimate poses. Often the royal couple would be shown kissing and caressing their daughters; one scene even featured the king and queen about to get into bed together. The portrayal of Akhenaten’s features seems designed to shock: massive jaw, drooping lips, and elongated, otherworldly eyes.In the king’s vision, religion became radically simplified. Egyptians worshipped as many as a thousand gods, but Akhenaten was loyal only to one. He and Nefertiti functioned as the sole intermediaries between the people and Aten, taking on the traditional role of the priesthood. Nefertiti was named co-regent, and while it’s unclear whether she wielded political power, her religious and symbolic status was highly unusual for a queen.All of this must have threatened priests of the old order who served Amun. After a few years at Amarna, the pharaoh ordered work crews to gouge out all images of Amun in state temples. It was an act of unbelievable boldness: the first time in history that a king had attacked a god. But revolutions have a way of turning against their greatest enthusiasts, and this violence eventually would consume Akhenaten’s own creations.I arrived at the site of the Great Aten Temple one day just as Barry Kemp found a piece of a broken statue of Akhenaten. Kemp is a professor emeritus from Cambridge University who directs the Amarna Project, and he’s worked at the site since 1977. He’s spent more than three times as many years digging through the city’s ruins as Akhenaten spent building it.“This is beautifully made,” he said, holding up the piece of carved stone statuary, on which only the king’s lower legs were visible. “This is not accidentally damaged.” Amarna archaeology has a forensic quality because so many artifacts were deliberately destroyed after the sudden death of the king around 1336 B.C. His only son and heir was Tutankhaten, no more than 10 years old, who soon replaced the “Aten” in his name with the title of the god that his father had hated: Tutankhamun. He abandoned Amarna and returned to the old traditions. Tutankhamun died unexpectedly, and soon the head of the army, Horemheb, declared himself pharaoh—possibly the first military coup in history.Horemheb and his successors, including Ramses the Great, dismantled Amarna’s royal buildings and temples. They destroyed statues of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and they omitted the names of the heretic king and his successors from official lists of Egyptian rulers. This act of damnatio memoriae was so successful that it was one of the reasons Tutankhamun’s tomb escaped significant looting in the Valley of the Kings. Tut’s tomb may even contain further secrets—during the past year archaeologists have been investigating signs of possible hidden doorways in two walls of the burial chamber. In pharaonic times generations of looters usually combed through such tombs, but Tut’s was largely left intact. People simply forgot that it was there.They also forgot most details of Amarna life. Kemp’s recent excavations have shown that the Great Aten Temple was destroyed and rebuilt sometime around Akhenaten’s 12th regnal year. The piece of statuary that he showed me dated to this event—it had been shattered at the command of the king himself, not his successors.“It’s an odd thing for them to have done, from our perspective,” Kemp said, explaining that Akhenaten used such fragments as the foundation for a new, revised temple. “The statue is no longer needed, so they reduce it to hard core. We have no commentary on what’s going on.”But other evidence is often remarkably intact. Ancient settlement sites were usually located in the Nile Valley, where millennia of floods and habitation destroyed original structures. In contrast, Amarna is situated in the desert above the river, where drinking water had to be hauled in. This was why the site was uninhabited before Akhenaten, and it’s why it was abandoned so completely. Even today you can still see the original brick walls of Amarna houses, and broken pottery is everywhere. It’s possible to visit the 3,300-year-old building where the famous painted bust of Nefertiti was excavated by a German archaeological team in 1912.Kemp told me that he was originally attracted to Amarna by the intact city site, not the outsize figure of Akhenaten. He believes that too many modern characteristics have been ascribed to the king, and in Kemp’s opinion, even the word religion is “mischievous” when applied to ancient Egypt. Like most scholars nowadays, he does not describe Akhenaten as a monotheist. The word is too charged by subsequent religious traditions, and during Akhenaten’s reign most Egyptians continued to worship other gods.Nevertheless, Kemp can’t entirely resist speculating about the king’s character. He’s impressed by the changeability of Akhenaten’s mind and by his ability to force workers to carry out his whims. At the Great Aten Temple, Kemp showed me traces of several large mud-brick offering tables that would have once been heaped with food and incense as part of rituals. The number of these tables is staggering—more than 1,700. “It’s an insight into his mind, a man with a rather obsessive literalist mind,” Kemp said. He once wrote: “The danger of being an absolute ruler is that no one dares tell you that what you have just decreed is not a good idea.”This lack of accountability probably also inspired artistic freedom. Ray Johnson, who directs the Chicago House, the University of Chicago’s research center in Luxor, believes that Akhenaten must have been “wildly creative,” despite his obsessive and despotic tendencies. “The later artistic representation at Amarna is so beautiful you could cry,” Johnson said. “Akhenaten rejected his own early exaggerated art style for a much softer naturalism later in his reign. The representations of women in particular are incredibly sensual.”Johnson has recently pieced together broken wall reliefs and statuary from collections scattered all around the world. Digitization makes work like this faster. Johnson showed me a virtual “join” in which he had matched a photograph of one fragment located in Copenhagen with another in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “They’re 4,000 miles apart, but I realized that they join,” he said. The connection reveals a surprising scene: Akhenaten performs a ritual not with Nefertiti, but with Kiya, another wife, who didn’t have the status of queen.A small number of scholars are involved in such work, and the ones I met seemed to have a softer view of Akhenaten, perhaps because of intimate contact with the art. This proved to be the king’s most lasting legacy, at least until his rediscovery in modern times. His city and his ritual practices were quickly abandoned, but the Amarna artistic style influenced subsequent periods. Marsha Hill, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, told me that handling Amarna’s sculpture fragments makes her feel more positive about Akhenaten.“Everybody likes revolutionaries at some level,” she said. “Someone who has a real good, strong idea that makes it seem like things are going to get better. I don’t see him as destructive. Of course, it didn’t work out. It usually doesn’t. Steam builds up under the ground until it explodes, and then you have to put it all together again.”Egypt’s modern revolution has made it even harder for archaeologists to study the scattered and shattered evidence of Akhenaten’s reign. In February 2011 protests on Cairo’s Tahrir Square forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled for nearly three decades. In 2012 Egypt held its first ever democratic presidential election, which was won by Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. But after just a year in office he was removed by a military coup. In the aftermath of this event, security forces massacred hundreds of Morsi supporters in Cairo. Protests raged across the country, including in Mallawi, a city across the Nile from Amarna. In August 2013 a local mob of Morsi supporters attacked a Coptic Christian church, a government office building, and the Mallawi Museum. During the violence the museum’s ticket taker was killed and every portable artifact was stolen—more than a thousand in all. Since then the police have recovered most of the pieces, but it took three years for the museum to reopen.At Amarna agricultural encroachment is an even greater threat than looting. Now that diesel-powered pumps bring water up from the river, farmers are reclaiming desert land, including parts of the ancient city that have yet to be excavated. Officially the site is protected, but enforcement has been badly weakened by the revolution. Mohammed Khallaf, then the director of the office of antiquities in Minya, the regional capital, told me that villagers around Amarna are legally limited to about 300 acres of cultivated land. “But they’ve added another 300 through violations,” he said. “Eighty percent of the encroachment has happened since the revolution.”The revolution also halted construction of the Aten Museum, the most impressive building in Minya. Designed by German and Egyptian architects, the modernist structure rises nearly 200 feet beside the Nile, in a shape reminiscent of a pyramid. In all of Egypt, Akhenaten is the only pharaoh who is still being honored by the creation of monumental architecture. It’s a testament to the fact that the country’s Muslim leaders embrace Akhenaten’s popular identity as a monotheist, but nevertheless his legacy can’t seem to escape political upheaval. More than $10 million was spent on the museum before the funding abruptly ended, a victim of the post-Tahrir economic collapse.High above the Nile a barefoot couple ritually descends a cliff face in hopes of curing infertility. In Egypt local people sometimes ask archaeologists to allow a young woman to circle an excavation, believing that the power of the antiquities will help her conceive. Such beliefs have nothing to do with Islam, and they reflect patterns and instincts that would have been familiar in ancient times. As Egyptologist Kemp has noted: “Inventing traditions was something that the Egyptians were very good at.”One day I visited the site and found 11 employees sitting in a darkened office with the air-conditioning off. Outside it was 109°F. Mohammed Shaben introduced himself as the museum’s IT manager and apologized for the heat—they had no electricity. I asked what an IT manager does without electricity.“I don’t have anything to do,” Shaben said. “Everybody is waiting.”He was 26, and most of the others were even younger. All were educated: curators, interior designers, restoration specialists. In Egypt about 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30, and young people dominated the Tahrir protests. They’ve also paid the highest price for the revolution’s failure. Since the coup there’s been a brutal crackdown on dissent, and Egyptian jails are home to tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of them young. Nearly a third of the country’s youth are unemployed. Shaben told me that he and other government employees were required to come and sit idly every day, despite the fact that construction on the facility had halted.He gave me a tour of the museum, which featured five floors, 14 exhibition halls, and a theater, everything unfinished and open to the elements. A pack of stray dogs had taken up residence inside the museum; the site was strewn with tiles, rebar, and rusting air-conditioner ducts. “Look out for the bats,” Shaben said, when we entered the theater. He told me that someday it will seat 800.A young antiquities inspector named Ahmed Gaafar accompanied us, complaining that the political upheaval had stymied his career as a curator. This pattern seems eternal, from the graves of Amarna to the frustration of Tahrir: In every time and in every place, revolutions eat the young. Gaafar mentioned Egypt’s recent presidential election, which had been won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who had led the coup that ousted Morsi, the Islamist leader. Gaafar saw a connection between this coup and Akhenaten’s era.“Some people say that Morsi is like Akhenaten, and Sisi is like Horemheb,” Gaafar said. “Horemheb liberated Egypt from a theocratic state that was growing weaker and weaker.” He continued, hopefully: “And he prepared the way for the Ramesside period, which was the greatest in Egyptian history. It’s the same with Sisi—he’s preparing Egypt to be great again.”That sentiment—preparing Egypt to be great again—is far older than Sisi or even Akhenaten. In ancient Egypt, after periods of weakness or disunity, leaders often declared a wehem mesut, literally “repeating a birth”—a renaissance. They turned to ancient symbols as a way of using past glories to promise future success. Tutankhamun declared a wehem mesut, and it seems Horemheb may have as well. And the strategy continues today. Revolutions gain legitimacy if they’re connected to the past, which is why Tahrir slogans were often accompanied by images of Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat. It’s also why marginalized groups around the world, ranging from gay-rights activists to Afrocentrists, have gravitated to the figure of Akhenaten.After three millennia, Akhenaten's visage remains iconic—in Minya a local artist decorates his home with sculptures of Akhenaten and Nefertiti (modeled on a statuette of a noblewoman named Tuya).At the Luxor Museum, his features appear on one of the few sculptures whose face was not smashed. Discovered beneath a temple at Karnak, this artifact appears to have been buried at the command of the king himself, who repeatedly changed the style of his portrayal, discarding previous versions.In 2012, after Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came to power, they passed a constitution that cited Akhenaten’s “monotheism,” and they named their policy program Nahda, Arabic for Renaissance. Three short years after Morsi was deposed, another charismatic leader on the other side of the world, Donald Trump, would rise under his own version of wehem mesut: “Make America Great Again.”In Egypt there’s always a temptation to hold that modern mirror to the distant past, remaking the pharaonic world in our image. But it’s also true that ancient Egyptians developed sophisticated political tactics—their system, after all, lasted more than 3,000 years. They introduced us to the concept of divine kingship, as well as many universal symbols of power, including the crown and the scepter. Amarna art often functioned as propaganda, portraying Akhenaten giving prizes to sycophants and parading around the city with deferential bodyguards. Barry Kemp has written that those scenes provide “an unintended caricature of all modern leaders who indulge in the trappings of charismatic display.”At the site of the Great Aten Temple, I asked Kemp whether such patterns of thought and behavior are universal across time. “We’re all the same species,” he said. “We’re wired up to some extent to think and behave the same way. But long-developed traditions moderate individual societies. That’s the responsibility—to find the balance between universal patterns and those that are distinctive culturally.”The Amarna Project, which organizes research at the site, keeps a Cairo office in a building next to Tahrir. Anna Stevens said that this environment has given her a new perspective on the past. “Living through this time has made me think much more about Akhenaten and the impact of revolutions,” she said, referring to the rise of Sisi. “I’m struck by this interest in a strong male leader.” She commented that at Amarna, the tombs of high officials feature Aten and the royal family, but thus far these images haven’t been found in the commoners’ cemeteries. “There’s no mention of Akhenaten or Nefertiti,” Stevens said. “It’s like it’s not their place.”She observed a similar dynamic with the elitism of today’s politics. “You can have very radical changes at the top, but below that, nothing changes,” she said. “You can shift a whole city to another part of Egypt; you can shift a whole group of people to Tahrir Square—but nothing changes.”In her view a revolution is an act of selective storytelling. “Akhenaten is creating a narrative,” Stevens said one day in her office. And then she pointed to an image of skeletons from a commoners’ cemetery. “But this narrative isn’t for these people, really.” Their stories will never be fully known, in the same way that the lives of most contemporary Egyptians are ignored when we focus on the dominant figures of national politics: Mubarak, Morsi, and Sisi. If we find it hard to capture the full range of revolutionary experiences during the past six years, what are the odds that we can truly understand the politics of the mid-14th century B.C.?“That’s the way life is,” Stevens said. She sat six stories above Tahrir, surrounded by a mess of data from Amarna excavations. But she seemed comfortable with Akhenaten’s fundamental uncertainty: the mysteries of his faith, the messages of his people’s bones, and all the broken pieces that would never be put together again. She smiled and said, “There’s no clear narrative.”",
"Carvings on the walls of the ancient Egyptian city of Amarna depict a world of plenty. Oxen are fattened in a cattle yard. Storehouses bulge with grain and fish. Musicians serenade the pharaoh as he feasts on meat at a banquet.But new research hints that life in Amarna was a combination of grinding toil and want—at least for the ordinary people who would have hauled the city's water, unloaded the boats on the Nile, and built Amarna's grand stone temples, which were erected in a rush on the orders of a ruler named Akhenaten, sometimes called the "Heretic Pharaoh."Researchers examining skeletons in the commoners' cemetery in Amarna have discovered that many of the city's children were malnourished and stunted. Adults show signs of backbreaking work, including high levels of injuries associated with accidents."We have evidence of the most stressed and disease-ridden of the ancient skeletons of Egypt that have been reported to date," said University of Arkansas bioarchaeologist Jerome Rose (a National Geographic Committe for Research and Exploration grantee), one of the team of experts examining the dead. "Amarna is the capital city of the Egyptian empire. There should be plenty of food . . . Something seems to be amiss."Amarna was the capital city conjured out of the desert sands in roughly 1350 B.C. by Akhenaten, husband to the famous Queen Nefertiti and likely father of King Tut. Akhenaten rejected the crowded cast of Egyptian gods in favor of the worship of just one, the Aten, or sun god. At Akhenaten's command, the city of Amarna was built some 200 miles (322 kilometers) south of modern Cairo as a place where Aten could reign supreme.Of the 20,000 to 30,000 people who lived at Amarna during its brief heyday—about 15 years—perhaps ten percent were the wealthy elite, who lived in spacious villas and had lavishly decorated tombs built for them. The rest ended their days in what is known today as the South Tombs cemetery, where most were buried in tightly packed graves marked by piles of rocks.Secrets From the GravesIn the current issue of the journal Antiquity, the Amarna Project team reports excavating more than 200 graves at the South Tombs site and finding only 20 coffins. Most of the skeletons are instead rolled in stick mats—a likely sign of modest means in a society that deemed coffins highly desirable. One of the cemetery's few coffins is painted with hieroglyphics that can't actually be read, suggesting that the coffin artist, and perhaps the person who commissioned the coffin, were illiterate.Nor do the tombs contain many of the grave goods found in wealthier burials. The ordinary people of Amarna couldn't have afforded much, but the bareness of their burials may also indicate that grave goods were becoming less important at the time, said archaeologist Anna Stevens, assistant director of the work at the site. Among the few objects found in the graves are three hippopotamus-shaped beads, probably worn by a woman or child before death as protective amulets.The children of Amarna apparently needed all the protection they could get. Skeletons from those between the ages of 3 and 25 at the time of death show signs of scurvy and rickets, according to research that Kathleen Kuckens, a University of Arkansas student working with Rose, will present at an anthropology meeting in April.Kuckens will also report that the children's teeth are grooved, a telltale mark of malnutrition. Children older than about 8.5 years showed signs of serious stunting, according to preliminary data that University of Arkansas graduate student Ashley Shidner will also present at the April meeting. It seems likely that those children weren't properly nourished and were engaged in abnormally high levels of physical activity. The children's skeletons show evidence of the constant use of muscles, Shidner said.Amarna's adults had it no easier than the children. More than 75 percent of the skeletons studied in detail had arthritis in their limbs or spines, suggesting hard labor. Fractured and compressed vertebrae were common, and 67 percent of the skeletons showed signs of at least one healing or healed fracture. Those rates are "really high" and "indicate a high workload," said osteoarchaeologist Jessica Kaiser of Ancient Egypt Research Associates, a group that is excavating around the pyramids of Giza.Heavy Workload (Literally)It may be no coincidence that Amarna was built using a recent innovation: a standardized stone building block now known as a talatat, which weighed nearly 155 pounds (70 kilograms) and was judged to be light enough for one worker to carry. A carved scene that probably originated at Amarna shows a man balancing a talatat block across his shoulders, bracing it with both hands. Perhaps, the researchers speculate, hefting stones like that contributed to the high degree of arthritis among Amarna's workers.Not all experts think the workload of Amarna's workers was exceptional, though. Skeletons at the ancient Egyptian cemetery called Saqqara also show frequent signs of trauma and physical activity, said Andrew Chamberlain, a University of Manchester bioarchaeologist who has studied the Saqqara remains. Rose responded that although he hasn't seen data for every ancient Egyptian population, many populations show lower levels of workload-related stress than the Amarna common folk do.After Akhenaten died in about 1336 B.C., Amarna was quickly abandoned. But the South Tombs cemetery has remained to provide a reality check on the propaganda of the pharaoh who hoped to build a place that would be a "House of Rejoicing" for the sun god."Amarna was supposed to be this great city where everyone would prosper," said Shidner. "But it wasn't quite the happy place that Akhenaten was making it out to be."",
"Sometimes the most powerful commentary on a king is made by those who are silent. One morning in Amarna, a village in Upper Egypt about 200 miles south of Cairo, a set of delicate, sparrowlike bones were arranged atop a wooden table. “The clavicle is here, and the upper arm, the ribs, the lower legs,” said Ashley Shidner, an American bioarchaeologist. “This one is about a year and a half to two years old.”The skeleton belonged to a child who lived at Amarna more than 3,300 years ago, when the site was Egypt’s capital. The city was founded by Akhenaten, a king who, along with his wife Nefertiti and his son, Tutankhamun, has captured the modern imagination as much as any other figure from ancient Egypt. This anonymous skeleton, in contrast, had been excavated from an unmarked grave. But the bones showed evidence of malnutrition, which Shidner and others have observed in the remains of dozens of Amarna children.“The growth delay starts around seven and a half months,” Shidner said. “That’s when you start transition feeding from breast milk to solid food.” At Amarna this transition seems to have been delayed for many children. “Possibly the mother is making the decision that there’s not enough food.”Until recently Akhenaten’s subjects seemed to be the only people who hadn’t weighed in on his legacy. Others have had plenty to say about the king, who ruled from around 1353 B.C. until 1336 B.C. and tried to transform Egyptian religion, art, and governance. Akhenaten’s successors were mostly scathing about his reign. Even Tutankhamun—whose brief reign has been a subject of fascination since his tomb was discovered in 1922—issued a decree criticizing conditions under his father: “The land was in distress; the gods had abandoned this land.” During the next dynasty, Akhenaten was referred to as “the criminal” and “the rebel,” and pharaohs destroyed his statues and images, trying to remove him from history entirely.Opinion swung to the opposite extreme during modern times, when archaeologists rediscovered Akhenaten. In 1905 Egyptologist James Henry Breasted described the king as “the first individual in human history.” To Breasted and many others, Akhenaten was a revolutionary whose ideas, especially the concept of monotheism, seemed far ahead of his time. And the archaeological record has always been thin enough to allow for excavations of the imagination. Dominic Montserrat, whose Akhenaten book is subtitled History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt, noted that we often take scattered evidence from ancient times and organize it into narratives that make sense in our world. We do this, he wrote, “so that the past could be held up to the present, like a mirror.”That modern mirror of Akhenaten has reflected almost every identity imaginable. The king has been portrayed as a proto-Christian, a peace-loving environmentalist, an out-and-proud homosexual, and a totalitarian dictator. His image was embraced with equal enthusiasm by both the Nazis and the Afrocentrist movement. Thomas Mann, Naguib Mahfouz, and Frida Kahlo all incorporated the pharaoh into their art. When Philip Glass wrote three operas about visionary thinkers, his trinity consisted of Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Akhenaten. Sigmund Freud once fainted during a heated argument with Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung about whether the Egyptian king had suffered from excessive love of his mother. (Freud’s diagnosis: Akhenaten was oedipal, almost a thousand years before Oedipus.)Archaeologists always tried to resist such interpretations, but key pieces of the puzzle were missing. Much study of Amarna has focused on elite culture: royal sculpture and architecture, and inscriptions from the tombs of high officials. For years scholars hoped for the opportunity to study the burial places of common people, knowing that Amarna’s brief window of existence—17 years—meant that a cemetery would provide a rare snapshot of everyday life. But it wasn’t until the early 2000s that a detailed survey of the surrounding desert finally located evidence of four separate cemeteries.After the discovery, archaeologists and bioarchaeologists spent nearly a decade excavating and analyzing the largest of these cemeteries. They collected a sample of skeletons from at least 432 people, and their findings were grim. Of the burials where age at death was known, 70 percent of the individuals had died before reaching 35, and only nine appear to have lived beyond 50. More than one-third were dead before they turned 15. The growth patterns of children were delayed by as much as two years. Many adults had suffered spinal damage, which bioarchaeologists believe is evidence that people were being overworked, perhaps in order to build the new capital.In 2015 the team proceeded to another cemetery, to the north of Amarna, where they excavated 135 bodies. Anna Stevens, an Australian archaeologist who directs the cemetery fieldwork, told me that excavators soon noticed something different about these burials. Many of the bodies appear to have been buried hastily, in graves that contain almost no goods or objects. There isn’t evidence of violent death, but family groupings seem to have broken down; in many cases it looks as if two or three unrelated people were tossed together into a grave. They were young—92 percent of the individuals in this cemetery were no older than 25. More than half died between the ages of seven and 15.“This is very clearly not a normal death curve,” Stevens said. “It may be no coincidence that this area had the king’s limestone quarries. Is this a group of workers who are being conscripted on the basis of their youth—and effectively being worked to death?” In her opinion, one thing is clear: “It absolutely dispels any lingering sense that Amarna was a nice place to live.”For Akhenaten, Amarna represented something pure and profoundly visionary. “No official has ever advised me concerning it,” the king wrote proudly of his founding of the brand-new capital city. He chose the site, a broad stretch of virgin desert above the east bank of the Nile, because it was uncontaminated by the worship of any god.No images of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, or Aten have been found in the commoners’ cemeteries, suggesting that the new religion had yet to be embraced by the masses. Today, though, Egyptians at a Cairo theme park pose in ways that recall the natural, family-oriented style of Amarna art. See how Akhenaten radically transformed centuries of artistic tradition in this detailed graphic.He also may have been motivated by the example of his father, Amenhotep III, who was one of the greatest builders of monuments, temples, and palaces in Egyptian history. Both kings were part of the 18th dynasty, which came to power after defeating the Hyksos, a group from the eastern Mediterranean that had invaded northern Egypt. The forefathers of the 18th dynasty were based in southern Egypt, and in order to drive out the Hyksos, they incorporated key innovations from their enemy, including the horse-drawn chariot and the composite bow. The Egyptians professionalized their military, and unlike most previous dynasties, the 18th maintained a standing army.They were also skilled at diplomacy, and the empire eventually stretched from current-day Sudan to Syria. Foreigners brought new wealth and skills to the Egyptian court, and the effects were profound. Under Amenhotep III, who ruled from around 1390 to 1353 B.C., the style of royal art shifted in ways that would be described today as more naturalistic.Even as Amenhotep III welcomed new ideas, he was also looking back to the distant past. He studied the pyramids of kings who had lived more than a thousand years earlier, and he incorporated traditional elements into festivals, temples, and royal palaces. He continued to worship Amun, who was the patron god of the city of Thebes. But Amenhotep III also began to emphasize Aten, a form of the sun god Re, portrayed as a solar disk, that recalled older patterns of worship.The king’s son took the throne as Amenhotep IV, but during the fifth year of his reign he made two momentous decisions. He changed his name to Akhenaten—Devoted to Aten—and he decided to move the capital to the site now known as Amarna. The king called his city Akhetaten, or Horizon of the Sun Disk, and soon this stretch of empty desert became home to an estimated 30,000 people. Palaces and temples were built quickly, at astonishing scale—the Great Aten Temple, the city’s largest ritual complex, was nearly a half mile long.Meanwhile Egyptian art was also being revolutionized. For centuries strict traditions had defined the correct subject matter, proportions, and poses of paintings and sculptures. Under Akhenaten, artisans were unleashed from these guidelines. They created lifelike, fluid scenes of the natural world, and they began to portray Akhenaten and his queen, Nefertiti, in unusually natural and intimate poses. Often the royal couple would be shown kissing and caressing their daughters; one scene even featured the king and queen about to get into bed together. The portrayal of Akhenaten’s features seems designed to shock: massive jaw, drooping lips, and elongated, otherworldly eyes.In the king’s vision, religion became radically simplified. Egyptians worshipped as many as a thousand gods, but Akhenaten was loyal only to one. He and Nefertiti functioned as the sole intermediaries between the people and Aten, taking on the traditional role of the priesthood. Nefertiti was named co-regent, and while it’s unclear whether she wielded political power, her religious and symbolic status was highly unusual for a queen.All of this must have threatened priests of the old order who served Amun. After a few years at Amarna, the pharaoh ordered work crews to gouge out all images of Amun in state temples. It was an act of unbelievable boldness: the first time in history that a king had attacked a god. But revolutions have a way of turning against their greatest enthusiasts, and this violence eventually would consume Akhenaten’s own creations.I arrived at the site of the Great Aten Temple one day just as Barry Kemp found a piece of a broken statue of Akhenaten. Kemp is a professor emeritus from Cambridge University who directs the Amarna Project, and he’s worked at the site since 1977. He’s spent more than three times as many years digging through the city’s ruins as Akhenaten spent building it.“This is beautifully made,” he said, holding up the piece of carved stone statuary, on which only the king’s lower legs were visible. “This is not accidentally damaged.” Amarna archaeology has a forensic quality because so many artifacts were deliberately destroyed after the sudden death of the king around 1336 B.C. His only son and heir was Tutankhaten, no more than 10 years old, who soon replaced the “Aten” in his name with the title of the god that his father had hated: Tutankhamun. He abandoned Amarna and returned to the old traditions. Tutankhamun died unexpectedly, and soon the head of the army, Horemheb, declared himself pharaoh—possibly the first military coup in history.Horemheb and his successors, including Ramses the Great, dismantled Amarna’s royal buildings and temples. They destroyed statues of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and they omitted the names of the heretic king and his successors from official lists of Egyptian rulers. This act of damnatio memoriae was so successful that it was one of the reasons Tutankhamun’s tomb escaped significant looting in the Valley of the Kings. Tut’s tomb may even contain further secrets—during the past year archaeologists have been investigating signs of possible hidden doorways in two walls of the burial chamber. In pharaonic times generations of looters usually combed through such tombs, but Tut’s was largely left intact. People simply forgot that it was there.They also forgot most details of Amarna life. Kemp’s recent excavations have shown that the Great Aten Temple was destroyed and rebuilt sometime around Akhenaten’s 12th regnal year. The piece of statuary that he showed me dated to this event—it had been shattered at the command of the king himself, not his successors.“It’s an odd thing for them to have done, from our perspective,” Kemp said, explaining that Akhenaten used such fragments as the foundation for a new, revised temple. “The statue is no longer needed, so they reduce it to hard core. We have no commentary on what’s going on.”But other evidence is often remarkably intact. Ancient settlement sites were usually located in the Nile Valley, where millennia of floods and habitation destroyed original structures. In contrast, Amarna is situated in the desert above the river, where drinking water had to be hauled in. This was why the site was uninhabited before Akhenaten, and it’s why it was abandoned so completely. Even today you can still see the original brick walls of Amarna houses, and broken pottery is everywhere. It’s possible to visit the 3,300-year-old building where the famous painted bust of Nefertiti was excavated by a German archaeological team in 1912.Kemp told me that he was originally attracted to Amarna by the intact city site, not the outsize figure of Akhenaten. He believes that too many modern characteristics have been ascribed to the king, and in Kemp’s opinion, even the word religion is “mischievous” when applied to ancient Egypt. Like most scholars nowadays, he does not describe Akhenaten as a monotheist. The word is too charged by subsequent religious traditions, and during Akhenaten’s reign most Egyptians continued to worship other gods.Nevertheless, Kemp can’t entirely resist speculating about the king’s character. He’s impressed by the changeability of Akhenaten’s mind and by his ability to force workers to carry out his whims. At the Great Aten Temple, Kemp showed me traces of several large mud-brick offering tables that would have once been heaped with food and incense as part of rituals. The number of these tables is staggering—more than 1,700. “It’s an insight into his mind, a man with a rather obsessive literalist mind,” Kemp said. He once wrote: “The danger of being an absolute ruler is that no one dares tell you that what you have just decreed is not a good idea.”This lack of accountability probably also inspired artistic freedom. Ray Johnson, who directs the Chicago House, the University of Chicago’s research center in Luxor, believes that Akhenaten must have been “wildly creative,” despite his obsessive and despotic tendencies. “The later artistic representation at Amarna is so beautiful you could cry,” Johnson said. “Akhenaten rejected his own early exaggerated art style for a much softer naturalism later in his reign. The representations of women in particular are incredibly sensual.”Johnson has recently pieced together broken wall reliefs and statuary from collections scattered all around the world. Digitization makes work like this faster. Johnson showed me a virtual “join” in which he had matched a photograph of one fragment located in Copenhagen with another in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “They’re 4,000 miles apart, but I realized that they join,” he said. The connection reveals a surprising scene: Akhenaten performs a ritual not with Nefertiti, but with Kiya, another wife, who didn’t have the status of queen.A small number of scholars are involved in such work, and the ones I met seemed to have a softer view of Akhenaten, perhaps because of intimate contact with the art. This proved to be the king’s most lasting legacy, at least until his rediscovery in modern times. His city and his ritual practices were quickly abandoned, but the Amarna artistic style influenced subsequent periods. Marsha Hill, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, told me that handling Amarna’s sculpture fragments makes her feel more positive about Akhenaten.“Everybody likes revolutionaries at some level,” she said. “Someone who has a real good, strong idea that makes it seem like things are going to get better. I don’t see him as destructive. Of course, it didn’t work out. It usually doesn’t. Steam builds up under the ground until it explodes, and then you have to put it all together again.”Egypt’s modern revolution has made it even harder for archaeologists to study the scattered and shattered evidence of Akhenaten’s reign. In February 2011 protests on Cairo’s Tahrir Square forced the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled for nearly three decades. In 2012 Egypt held its first ever democratic presidential election, which was won by Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. But after just a year in office he was removed by a military coup. In the aftermath of this event, security forces massacred hundreds of Morsi supporters in Cairo. Protests raged across the country, including in Mallawi, a city across the Nile from Amarna. In August 2013 a local mob of Morsi supporters attacked a Coptic Christian church, a government office building, and the Mallawi Museum. During the violence the museum’s ticket taker was killed and every portable artifact was stolen—more than a thousand in all. Since then the police have recovered most of the pieces, but it took three years for the museum to reopen.At Amarna agricultural encroachment is an even greater threat than looting. Now that diesel-powered pumps bring water up from the river, farmers are reclaiming desert land, including parts of the ancient city that have yet to be excavated. Officially the site is protected, but enforcement has been badly weakened by the revolution. Mohammed Khallaf, then the director of the office of antiquities in Minya, the regional capital, told me that villagers around Amarna are legally limited to about 300 acres of cultivated land. “But they’ve added another 300 through violations,” he said. “Eighty percent of the encroachment has happened since the revolution.”The revolution also halted construction of the Aten Museum, the most impressive building in Minya. Designed by German and Egyptian architects, the modernist structure rises nearly 200 feet beside the Nile, in a shape reminiscent of a pyramid. In all of Egypt, Akhenaten is the only pharaoh who is still being honored by the creation of monumental architecture. It’s a testament to the fact that the country’s Muslim leaders embrace Akhenaten’s popular identity as a monotheist, but nevertheless his legacy can’t seem to escape political upheaval. More than $10 million was spent on the museum before the funding abruptly ended, a victim of the post-Tahrir economic collapse.High above the Nile a barefoot couple ritually descends a cliff face in hopes of curing infertility. In Egypt local people sometimes ask archaeologists to allow a young woman to circle an excavation, believing that the power of the antiquities will help her conceive. Such beliefs have nothing to do with Islam, and they reflect patterns and instincts that would have been familiar in ancient times. As Egyptologist Kemp has noted: “Inventing traditions was something that the Egyptians were very good at.”One day I visited the site and found 11 employees sitting in a darkened office with the air-conditioning off. Outside it was 109°F. Mohammed Shaben introduced himself as the museum’s IT manager and apologized for the heat—they had no electricity. I asked what an IT manager does without electricity.“I don’t have anything to do,” Shaben said. “Everybody is waiting.”He was 26, and most of the others were even younger. All were educated: curators, interior designers, restoration specialists. In Egypt about 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30, and young people dominated the Tahrir protests. They’ve also paid the highest price for the revolution’s failure. Since the coup there’s been a brutal crackdown on dissent, and Egyptian jails are home to tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of them young. Nearly a third of the country’s youth are unemployed. Shaben told me that he and other government employees were required to come and sit idly every day, despite the fact that construction on the facility had halted.He gave me a tour of the museum, which featured five floors, 14 exhibition halls, and a theater, everything unfinished and open to the elements. A pack of stray dogs had taken up residence inside the museum; the site was strewn with tiles, rebar, and rusting air-conditioner ducts. “Look out for the bats,” Shaben said, when we entered the theater. He told me that someday it will seat 800.A young antiquities inspector named Ahmed Gaafar accompanied us, complaining that the political upheaval had stymied his career as a curator. This pattern seems eternal, from the graves of Amarna to the frustration of Tahrir: In every time and in every place, revolutions eat the young. Gaafar mentioned Egypt’s recent presidential election, which had been won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who had led the coup that ousted Morsi, the Islamist leader. Gaafar saw a connection between this coup and Akhenaten’s era.“Some people say that Morsi is like Akhenaten, and Sisi is like Horemheb,” Gaafar said. “Horemheb liberated Egypt from a theocratic state that was growing weaker and weaker.” He continued, hopefully: “And he prepared the way for the Ramesside period, which was the greatest in Egyptian history. It’s the same with Sisi—he’s preparing Egypt to be great again.”That sentiment—preparing Egypt to be great again—is far older than Sisi or even Akhenaten. In ancient Egypt, after periods of weakness or disunity, leaders often declared a wehem mesut, literally “repeating a birth”—a renaissance. They turned to ancient symbols as a way of using past glories to promise future success. Tutankhamun declared a wehem mesut, and it seems Horemheb may have as well. And the strategy continues today. Revolutions gain legitimacy if they’re connected to the past, which is why Tahrir slogans were often accompanied by images of Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat. It’s also why marginalized groups around the world, ranging from gay-rights activists to Afrocentrists, have gravitated to the figure of Akhenaten.After three millennia, Akhenaten's visage remains iconic—in Minya a local artist decorates his home with sculptures of Akhenaten and Nefertiti (modeled on a statuette of a noblewoman named Tuya).At the Luxor Museum, his features appear on one of the few sculptures whose face was not smashed. Discovered beneath a temple at Karnak, this artifact appears to have been buried at the command of the king himself, who repeatedly changed the style of his portrayal, discarding previous versions.In 2012, after Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came to power, they passed a constitution that cited Akhenaten’s “monotheism,” and they named their policy program Nahda, Arabic for Renaissance. Three short years after Morsi was deposed, another charismatic leader on the other side of the world, Donald Trump, would rise under his own version of wehem mesut: “Make America Great Again.”In Egypt there’s always a temptation to hold that modern mirror to the distant past, remaking the pharaonic world in our image. But it’s also true that ancient Egyptians developed sophisticated political tactics—their system, after all, lasted more than 3,000 years. They introduced us to the concept of divine kingship, as well as many universal symbols of power, including the crown and the scepter. Amarna art often functioned as propaganda, portraying Akhenaten giving prizes to sycophants and parading around the city with deferential bodyguards. Barry Kemp has written that those scenes provide “an unintended caricature of all modern leaders who indulge in the trappings of charismatic display.”At the site of the Great Aten Temple, I asked Kemp whether such patterns of thought and behavior are universal across time. “We’re all the same species,” he said. “We’re wired up to some extent to think and behave the same way. But long-developed traditions moderate individual societies. That’s the responsibility—to find the balance between universal patterns and those that are distinctive culturally.”The Amarna Project, which organizes research at the site, keeps a Cairo office in a building next to Tahrir. Anna Stevens said that this environment has given her a new perspective on the past. “Living through this time has made me think much more about Akhenaten and the impact of revolutions,” she said, referring to the rise of Sisi. “I’m struck by this interest in a strong male leader.” She commented that at Amarna, the tombs of high officials feature Aten and the royal family, but thus far these images haven’t been found in the commoners’ cemeteries. “There’s no mention of Akhenaten or Nefertiti,” Stevens said. “It’s like it’s not their place.”She observed a similar dynamic with the elitism of today’s politics. “You can have very radical changes at the top, but below that, nothing changes,” she said. “You can shift a whole city to another part of Egypt; you can shift a whole group of people to Tahrir Square—but nothing changes.”In her view a revolution is an act of selective storytelling. “Akhenaten is creating a narrative,” Stevens said one day in her office. And then she pointed to an image of skeletons from a commoners’ cemetery. “But this narrative isn’t for these people, really.” Their stories will never be fully known, in the same way that the lives of most contemporary Egyptians are ignored when we focus on the dominant figures of national politics: Mubarak, Morsi, and Sisi. If we find it hard to capture the full range of revolutionary experiences during the past six years, what are the odds that we can truly understand the politics of the mid-14th century B.C.?“That’s the way life is,” Stevens said. She sat six stories above Tahrir, surrounded by a mess of data from Amarna excavations. But she seemed comfortable with Akhenaten’s fundamental uncertainty: the mysteries of his faith, the messages of his people’s bones, and all the broken pieces that would never be put together again. She smiled and said, “There’s no clear narrative.”",
"By Whitney Johnson, Director of Visual and Immersive Experiences  Paolo Verzone has an eye for the dramatic. The three-time World Press Photo award winner has crisscrossed Norway’s Svalbard to document life in the high Arctic. He’s taken Antonio Banderas’s portrait on a moment’s notice amid the glitz and glam of Cannes. He’s even photographed the lethal hands of a retired Mafia hitman—an assignment that still makes him shudder.  But how can photography bring life and drama to subjects that have been dead for more than 66 million years? That was Paolo’s mandate for the cover story of this month’s National Geographic, a deep dive into the new science of dinosaurs. (Above, paleontologist Samir Zouhri at a site in Morocco.)  In part, Paolo used lighting to make bones feel alive, even familiar. When photographing fossils of the dinosaur Spinosaurus—which new evidence suggests spent much of its time in the water—Verzone repurposed a half-filled water bottle to imprint subtle ripples on the light striking the bones. The goal: to invoke the memory of water in the viewer."It’s something that you feel somehow, it’s déjà vu,” he tells my colleague Michael Greshko. “Of course, it’s not normal to see that on a bone from a dinosaur, but the feeling… it’s a warm feeling, it’s comfort.”  “I’m trying to describe the feelings I have when I do these lights,” Paolo adds. “It’s kind of magical sparkles that can bring anything to life.” (Above left, team members examine a Spinosaurus tail vertebrae; at right, long spines of bone protrude from the Spinosaurus tail vertebrae.)  But for Paolo, the story of dinosaurs isn’t about bones locked away in stone; it’s about the dreamers and thinkers who study fossils and dig them up in even the harshest conditions. “It’s all about the humans,” he says. “Dinosaurs come out to light only because humans work in the dark.” (Below left, a statue of Triceratops, outside Morocco’s Tahiri Fossil Museum; at right, the museum.)

"Ancient Egypt’s most famous pharaoh was the offspring of a union between siblings. Inbreeding may have afflicted him with a congenital clubfoot and even prevented him from producing an heir with his wife, who was probably his half sister.If the new investigations into King Tut's tomb reveal hidden rooms, could those chambers hold the burial of Nefertiti, the long-lost queen who is doubly connected to the teenage pharaoh? If so, they might add one more mummy to his intriguingly interwoven family ties.More than a century of excavations in and around Egypt’s Valley of the Kings has revealed 64 tombs and other related chambers. The treasure-filled burial of King Tutankhamun, known now as KV62, is by far the most famous. But many other royal tombs and mummies from ancient Egypt's 18th and 19th Dynasties have also come to light.(Read: "Mystery of King Tut's Death Solved? Maybe Not")Beginning in 2007, Egyptian scientists conducted genetic tests on 16 royal mummies. The ones pictured here were identified as Tut's near and dear—his grandparents, his parents, his wife, and two mummified fetuses who were found in his tomb and were most likely his daughters.But there's one legendary royal mummy from this period who’s missing, and whose name pops up every time there's a new discovery in this royal cemetery—the beautiful Queen Nefertiti. She was the principal wife of Akhenaten, Tut's father. Tut's mother was a different wife, whose name we don't know. That makes Nefertiti Tut's stepmother.(Read about skepticism toward claims of finding Nefertiti's tomb.)Tut's family ties are further complicated by the royal custom of incest during this period. Tut married his half sister Ankhesenamun, a daughter of Nefertiti and Akhenaten. And that makes Nefertiti his mother-in-law.",
"A fossil tooth from Squalicorax, a fearsome shark which grew up to 16 feet long and went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period.Dinosaurs, birds, and pterosaurs were not the only species to suffer extinctions at the hands of an asteroid that plummeted through the surface of the Earth 66 million years ago. Researchers have found that a mass extinction of sharks followed, wiping out most of what had been the dominant group of these ocean-going predators during the Cretaceous period.While dinosaurs terrorized the land, giant marine reptiles and a great diversity of sharks patrolled the seas. Some of these sharks, in a group known as the anacoracids, fed on marine molluscs and reptiles, and, as scientists report today in the journal Current Biology, the loss of these prey to the asteroid may have been a contributing factor in their extinction.Prehistoric sharks that ate marine reptiles went extinct 66 million years ago when their food sources—such as the 56-foot-long Mosasaurus, seen here in the background—also perished.“Subtle but important shifts may have laid the foundation for what later became the radiation of carcharhiniforms, or ground sharks, which are the most diverse lineage of sharks today,” says study co-author Nicolás Campione, a paleontologist at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia. “After the extinction, carcharhiniforms proliferated… and we hypothesize that changes in food availability played an important role in this shift.”Shark skeletons are predominantly cartilage, which fossilizes poorly, making the study of ancient sharks difficult. Instead, the international group of authors behind the study looked to something more durable. They analyzed hundreds of shark teeth from fossil deposits left before and after the extinction event to see how the number and shape of teeth changed over time. In very general terms, wide, triangular teeth indicate a cutting function useful for eating large prey, while thinner, longer teeth suggest a grasping function important when eating fish.Pacific angelshark. Santa Catalina Island, California“This paper makes a strong case for studying sharks and shark fossils as part of the end-Cretaceous extinction,” says William E. Bemis, curator of ichthyology at the Cornell Museum of Vertebrates in Ithaca, New York, who was not one of the study authors.“Sharks offer a glimpse into changes in marine systems in particular, as groups of marine reptiles went extinct, some to be eventually replaced by marine mammals, while bony fishes explosively radiated,” he says.There are two major groups of predatory sharks today. Carcharhiniform or ground sharks—including bull, tiger and hammerhead sharks—are the most numerous, represented by more than 250 species. Lamniform or mackerel sharks—such as great white, mako and grey nurse sharks—number only 15 species today.But during the Cretaceous period this dominance was reversed, with mackerel sharks—in particular, a diverse group of great-white-like species called the anacoracids—being far more numerous than ground sharks. One fearsome and stocky species, Squalicorax, which reached up to 16 feet in length, may have relied on giant marine reptiles for sustenance.Relatively smaller plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, including Plioplatecarpus and Prognathodon, were likely easy pickings for sharks such as Squalicorax. But one of the most common marine reptiles still present at the end of the Cretaceous period was Mosasaurus. At 56 feet long, a full grown Mosasaurus would likely have been too big to be threatened by a Squalicorax. In fact, this apex predator may itself have preyed upon sharks. But Campione says Squalicorax would likely have scavenged dead mosasaurs and hunted juveniles comparable to or smaller than itself in size. Their diet may also have included many large species of squid in coiled shells, known as ammonites.But when the large prey these mackerel sharks relied upon abruptly vanished after the impact, so too did the sharks that fed upon them. As many as 34 percent of all shark species alive at that time are thought to have died out. Many of the sharks that eventually replaced them were fish-eating species that came to be the ancestors of most of the sharks in our oceans today.“The end-Cretaceous extinction saw major losses in marine reptiles and cephalopods that would have been an important food source for anacoracids such as Squalicorax,” says Camipone. “The post-extinction world, however, saw the rise of bony fishes. So anacoracids, which would have relied on large marine organisms for sustenance, did poorly across the extinction, whereas predominantly fish-eating forms, such as smaller-bodied houndsharks, did well.”Scientists analyze ancient shark teeth, which are a more reliable source of information than shark skeletons, which are mostly cartilage and fossilize poorly.It's interesting that the overall variety of tooth shapes is similar both before and following recovery from the end-Cretaceous event, comments Michael Coates, an expert on the evolution of fish at the University of Chicago. “As a loose metaphor, the shows goes on, but with a reshuffled cast…. the post-extinction replacements moving into, apparently, much the same eco-space formerly occupied by the extinction victims.”“It's a nice study that adds detail to the emerging picture of how major groups of vertebrates suffered and recovered from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction,” he adds. “Inevitably, this study is limited to the record of shed teeth, shark body fossils being extremely rare. But teeth provide a useful marker of what kinds were present and persisted.”Through the study of teeth, the researchers were “able to get a glimpse at the lives of extinct sharks,” says Campione. At least 50 percent of living shark species are threatened or declining, so understanding what led to shark extinctions in the past might offer insights into preventing them suffering the same fate, he adds.Follow John Pickrell on Twitter.",
"Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid struck eastern Mexico and wiped out the dinosaurs. Now scientists have a better idea of what that looked like.Imagine sunrise on the last day of the Mesozoic era, 66 million years ago. Shafts of sunlight rake through the swamps and coniferous forests along the coast of what is now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The blood-warm seas of the Gulf of Mexico teem with life.As this lost world of dinosaurs and outsize insects squawks and buzzes and whirs to life, an asteroid the size of a mountain is hurtling toward Earth at about 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) an hour.For a few fleeting moments, a fireball that appears far bigger and brighter than the sun streaks through the sky. An instant later, the asteroid slams into Earth with an explosive yield estimated at over 100 trillion tons of TNT.The impact penetrates Earth’s crust to a depth of several miles, gouging a crater more than 115 miles (185 kilometers) across and vaporizing thousands of cubic miles of rock. The event sets off a chain of global catastrophes that wipe out 80 percent of life on Earth—including most of the dinosaurs.This apocalyptic tale has been described in countless books and magazines ever since the asteroid impact theory was first put forth in 1980. The identification of Chicxulub Crater in the Gulf of Mexico during the 1990s then gave scientists an accurate idea of the “when” and the “where.”But exactly how the fallout killed off so much life on Earth has remained a tantalizing mystery.This is a piece of the asteroid that made the Chicxulub Crater.Last month, a team of British scientists working on an off-shore drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico obtained the first-ever core samples from the “peak ring” of the Chicxulub Crater. This ring is where the shocked Earth rebounded in the seconds following the impact, and the swelling formed a large circular structure within the crater walls. By studying its topsy-turvy geology, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the phenomenal forces unleashed that day.What is already known would beggar the imaginations of Hollywood scriptwriters. Using an “impact calculator” developed by a team of geophysicists from Purdue University and Imperial College London, users can enter in a few key details, such as the asteroid’s size and speed, to paint a vivid picture of events.“You can plug in different distances from the point of impact to see how the effects change over distance,” says Joanna Morgan, one of the lead scientists on the Chicxulub drilling project. “If you were close by, say within 1,000 kilometers [625 miles], you would be instantaneously, or within a few seconds, killed by the fireball.”Scientists used a drill to investigate the Chicxulub Crater.Indeed, if you were near enough to see it, you were dead, says Gareth Collins, a lecturer on planetary science at Imperial College who helped develop the program.Nine seconds after impact, an observer at that distance would have been roasted by a blast of thermal radiation. Trees, grass, and shrubs would have spontaneously burst into flame, and anyone present would have suffered instant third-degree burns over their entire bodies.After the fire comes the flood. Depending on the local topography, the impact would have kicked up a phenomenal tsunami up to 1,000 feet (305 meters) high. And at the low-end estimate of 10.1 on the Richter scale, the subsequent earthquake would have been more powerful than anything ever measured or experienced by humans.“A seismic event of this size would be the equivalent of all the world’s earthquakes for the past 160 years going off simultaneously,” says Rick Aster, professor of seismology at Colorado State University and former president of the Seismological Society of America.At just over eight minutes post-impact, ejecta would start to spill down, smothering the burning landscapes beneath a blanket of hot grit and ash. Closer to the impact zone, the ground would be buried beneath hundreds, even thousands, of feet of rubble.About 45 minutes later, a blast of wind would tear through the region at 600 miles (965 kilometers) an hour, scattering debris and leveling anything that might still be standing. The sound of the explosion would arrive at the same time, a 105-decibel roar as deafening as a jet making a low pass flyover.These rocks were brought up by scientists from the Chicxulub Crater.Further afield, out of range of the direct effects of the explosion, an observer would be treated to the spectacle of darkening skies and an apocalyptic display of shooting stars created by the impact debris raining back on Earth.“They wouldn’t have looked quite like regular shooting stars or meteors,” says Collins. “Meteors burn up at higher speeds and get hotter. These would have been re-entering the atmosphere at lower altitudes, traveling slower and emitting infrared radiation. I’m not entirely sure what that would look like. Some sort of red glow would be my guess.”After the red glow, the sky would darken as ash and debris swirling around the globe created a creeping twilight.“For the first few hours, there would have been close to total darkness,” says Collins. “But soon after that, the sky would begin to lighten. The following weeks, months perhaps even years were probably somewhere between twilight and a very cloudy day.”People gaze at Tristan the Tyrannosaurus rex in Berlin, Germany. Tristan was found in Montana and is one of the best preserved large dinosaur skeletons ever discovered.While most accounts focus on the spectacular violence of those first few minutes to days after the impact, it was the long-term environmental effects that ultimately wiped out most dinosaurs and much of the rest of life on Earth.The prevailing dimness caused by the dust cloud meant photosynthesis would have been dramatically reduced. The soot and ash would have taken months to wash out of the atmosphere, and when it did, the rain would have fallen as acidic mud. Massive fires would have produced huge amounts of toxins that temporarily destroyed the planet’s protective ozone layer.Then there was the carbon footprint of the impact itself, which released an estimated 10,000 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 100 billion tons of carbon monoxide, and another 100 billion tons of methane in one fell swoop, according to geologist David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute.In effect, the aftermath of the asteroid was probably a powerful one-two punch of nuclear winter followed by dramatic global warming. And that’s where the core samples freshly pulled from Chicxulub Crater can help fill in gaps in this infamous story.“The drilling program will help us understand how all this affected the post-impact climate—how much material was ejected into the stratosphere and what that material was,” says Morgan.",
"Not far beneath the surface of the Coral Sea, where the Great Barrier Reef lives, parrotfish teeth grind against rock, crab claws snap as they battle over hiding spots, and a 600-pound grouper pulses its swim bladder to announce its presence with a muscular whump. Sharks and silver jacks flash by. Anemone arms flutter and tiny fish and shrimp seem to dance a jig as they guard their nooks. Anything that can't glom on to something rigid is tugged and tossed by each ocean swell.The reef's sheer diversity is part of what makes it great. It hosts 5,000 types of mollusks, 1,800 species of fish, 125 kinds of sharks, and innumerable miniature organisms. But the most riveting sight of all—and the main reason for World Heritage status—is the vast expanse of coral, from staghorn stalks and wave-smoothed plates to mitt-shaped boulders draped with nubby brown corals as leathery as saddles. Soft corals top hard ones, algae and sponges paint the rocks, and every crevice is a creature's home. The biology, like the reef, transforms from the north—where the reef began—to the south. The shifting menagerie is unmatched in the world.The peculiar humphead wrasse is among the reef’s many thousands of species.Time and tides and a planet in eternal flux brought the Great Barrier Reef into being millions of years ago, wore it down, and grew it back—over and over again. Now all the factors that let the reef grow are changing at a rate the Earth has never before experienced. This time the reef may degrade below a crucial threshold from which it cannot bounce back.Europeans were introduced to the Great Barrier Reef by British explorer Capt. James Cook, who came upon it quite by accident. On a June evening in 1770, Cook heard the screech of wood against stone; he couldn't have imagined that his ship had run into the most massive living structure on Earth: more than 10,000 square miles of coral ribbons and isles waxing and waning for some 1,400 winding miles.Cook's team had been exploring the waters offshore of what is now Queensland when the H.M.S. Endeavour became trapped in the labyrinth. Not far beneath the surface, jagged towers of coral tore into the ship's hull and held the vessel fast. As timbers splintered and the sea poured in, the crew arrived on deck "with countenances which sufficiently expressed the horrors of our situation," Cook later wrote in his diary. Captain and crew were able to limp to a river mouth to patch their vessel.Aborigines had lived in the region for thousands of years before Europeans hit the rocks. Culturally, the reef has been a rich part of the landscape for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who have canoed it and fished it and shared myths about its creatures for generations. But historians aren't sure how deep their knowledge went of the reef's geology and animal life. A few decades after Cook's run-in with the behemoth beneath the sea, English cartographer Matthew Flinders—who also had a mishap or two while "threading the needle" among the reefs—gave the entity its name, inspired by its size. All told, if the reef's main chunks were plucked from the sea and laid out to dry, the rock could cover all of New Jersey, with coral to spare.This mammoth reef owes its existence to organisms typically no bigger than a grain of rice. Coral polyps, the reef's building blocks, are tiny colonial animals that house symbiotic algae in their cells. As those algae photosynthesize—using light to create energy—each polyp is fueled to secrete a "house" of calcium carbonate, or limestone. As one house tops another, the colony expands like a city; other marine life quickly grabs on and spreads, helping cement all the pieces together.Off Australia's eastern edge, conditions are ripe for this building of stone walls. Corals grow best in shallow, clear, turbulent water with lots of light to support photosynthesis. Millions of polyp generations later, the reef stands not as a singular thing but as a jumble whose shapes, sizes, and life-forms are determined by where in the ocean they lie—how close to shore, for example—and what forces work on them, such as heavy waves. Go far enough from the coast, where the light is low and the waters are deeper, and there's no reef at all."In the Great Barrier Reef, corals set the patterns of life from end to end," says Charlie Veron, coral expert and a longtime chief scientist for the Australian Institute of Marine Science. With over 400 species in the region, "they structure the entire environment; they're the habitat for everything else here." The perfect temperature, clarity, and currents enable plate corals, for example, to increase in diameter up to a foot a year. The reef continuously erodes as well, worn down by waves, ocean chemistry, and organisms that eat limestone. This vanishing act is far slower than the constant building up; still, as much as 90 percent of the rock eventually dissipates into the waters, forming sand. So the living veneer of this reef, the part a diver sees, is ever changing.And the layers beneath are relatively young, geologically speaking, at less than 10,000 years. The reef's true beginnings go back much further. Closer to 25 million years ago, Veron says, as Queensland edged into tropical waters with the movement of the Indo-Australian tectonic plate, coral larvae began riding south-flowing currents from the Indo-Pacific, grabbing footholds wherever they could. Slowly, rocky colonies grew and spread along the seafloor flush with diverse marine life.Since the reef first found footing, ice ages have come and gone, tectonic plates have crept forward, and ocean and atmospheric conditions have fluctuated wildly. The reef has seen many iterations—expanding and eroding, being defaced and reinhabited at nature's whim."A history of the Great Barrier Reef," Veron says, "is a catalog of disasters" caused by planetary chaos. But they are disasters from which the reef has always recovered.Today new disasters endanger the reef, and the prospect for recovery is uncertain. The relatively quick shift in the world's climate, scientists say, appears to be devastating for reefs. In corals, warming temperatures and increased exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays lead to a stress response called bleaching—when the colorful algae in coral cells become toxic and are expelled, turning the host animals skeletal white. Fleshy seaweeds may then choke out the remains.Major bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef and elsewhere in 1997-98 was linked to a severe El Niño year and record-high sea-surface temperatures—in some spots 3°F higher than normal. Another round began in 2001 and again in 2005. By 2030, some reef experts say, these destructive episodes will occur every year.Heat is also implicated in a 60-year decline in ocean phytoplankton—the microscopic organisms that not only gobble greenhouse gases but also feed, directly or indirectly, almost every other living thing in the sea. Reef fish, too, respond to warmer waters—sometimes with bolder, more aggressive behavior toward both predators and prey. Changes in sea level, either up or down, have a dire impact as well, exposing shallow corals to too much sun or drowning them in deeper water, where they're hidden from the light.A more immediate concern is massive flooding in Australia that earlier this year sent huge plumes of sediment and toxin-laden waters onto the reef off Queensland. The full harm to marine life won't be clear for years, but long stretches of the Great Barrier Reef could experience disastrous die-offs.And then there's the acid test.Reef ecosystems worldwide took a pounding during each of Earth's five mass extinctions, the first about 440 million years ago. Greenhouse gases spiked naturally over the millennia, and Aussie biologist Veron says massive spewing of carbon dioxide during periods of heavy volcanic activity was likely a big player in coral decimation, notably the most recent mass extinction some 65 million years ago. At that time, oceans absorbed more and more of those greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, causing ocean acidity to rise. The lower pH—a sign of high levels of acidity—ultimately thwarted the ability of marine creatures to build their limestone shells and skeletons.In some oceans this acidification is once again happening. The most vulnerable to acid's corrosive bite are the fast-growing branching corals and vital calcium-excreting algae that help bind the reef. The more brittle the reef's bones, the more wave action, storms, diseases, pollutants, and other stresses can break them.In ancient times many corals adapted to changing ocean acidity, says Veron, who paints a particularly bleak picture of the Barrier Reef's future. "The difference is there were long stretches in between; corals had millions of years to work it out." He fears that with unprecedented CO2, sulfur, and nitrogen emissions by human industry, added to the increasing escape of methane as a result of Earth's melting ice, much of the reef will be nearly bereft of life within 50 years. What will be left? "Coral skeletons bathed in algal slime," he says.Of course, to the two million tourists who visit the reef each year, the promise of an underwater paradise teeming with life is still fulfilled. But the blemishes are there if you know where to look. The reef bears a two-mile-long scar from a collision with a Chinese coal carrier in April of last year. Other ship groundings and occasional oil spills have marred the habitat. Sediment plumes from flooding and nutrients from agriculture and development also do very real damage to the ecosystem. But Aussies aren't inclined to let the reef fall apart without a national outcry. The captain of the boat who took me diving put it this way: "Without the reef, there's nothing out here but a whole lot of salty water." To many locals, he adds, "the reef is a loved one whose loss is too sad to contemplate." And it is also crucial economically: The visitors he motors to the reef's edges provide more than one billion dollars annually for Australia's books.The challenge scientists face is to keep the reef healthy despite rapid change. "To fix a car engine, you need to know how it works," says marine biologist Terry Hughes of James Cook University. "The same is true for reefs." He and others have been investigating how these ecosystems function so that efforts to prevent damage can be doubly effective.High on the to-do list: Determine the full impact of overfishing. Traditionally, commercial fishermen could work along the reef, even after 133,000 square miles of ocean habitat was designated a marine park in 1975. But with rising concern about the big take, the Australian government in 2004 made a third of that area, in strategically placed zones, off-limits to all fishing—including for sport. The biological recovery has been bigger and faster than expected; within two years after the ban, for example, numbers of coral trout doubled on once heavily fished reef. Some scientists speculate that protective zones may also lead to declines in outbreaks of a devastating coral-eating sea star.Scientists also want to know what makes specific corals extra tenacious during times of change. "We know some reefs experience much more stressful conditions than others," says reef ecologist Peter Mumby of the University of Queensland. "Looking at decades of sea temperature data, we can now map where corals are most acclimated to warmth and target conservation actions there." He says understanding how corals recover from bleaching—and figuring out where new polyps are likely to grow—can help in designing reserves. Even the outspoken Veron acknowledges that coral survival is possible long-term if the onslaughts against reefs are halted—soon.Nature has some safeguards of her own, including a genetic script for corals that may have helped them ride out past environmental disruptions. Many reef builders evolve through hybridization—when different species mix genes. As Veron puts it, "everything is always on its way to becoming something else." On the reef, about a third of the corals reproduce in annual mass spawning. During such events, as many as 35 species on a single patch of reef release their egg and sperm bundles simultaneously, which means millions of gametes from genetically different parents mingle in a slick at the ocean surface. "This provides outstanding opportunities to produce hybrids," explains marine biologist Bette Willis of James Cook University. Especially with climate and ocean chemistry in such flux, she says, hybridization can offer a speedy path to adaptation and hardiness against disease.Indeed, one lesson is that despite today's weighty threats, the Great Barrier Reef won't easily crumble. It has, after all, toughed it out through catastrophic change before. And all kinds of marine life are around to help keep the reef whole. In studies conducted in 2007, scientists found that where grazing fish thrive, so do corals, especially in waters polluted with excess nutrients. "If you take away herbivores, say through over­fishing, seaweed replaces corals," says Hughes. If voracious vegetarians are protected, corals can prevail.A human visitor to the reef can see the fish doing their vital job. In dappled afternoon light toward the reef's northern tip, palatial walls of coral tower over a rare species of batfish, long finned and masked in black, that nibbles back strands of sargassum. And a school of parrotfish—fused teeth like wire cutters—chip away noisily at the rocks, where algae in mats of green and red have quietly taken hold.",

-->This is the day of the tangerine sky. It is midsummer, mid-afternoon, and the sky above Auckland, New Zealand, has turned dark orange, as if in an eclipse. Drivers turn on their headlights. Worried residents call the emergency number to ask what’s happening. Smoke from Australia’s bushfires is drifting across the ocean and turning our own sky fiery. We have seen the headlines: “Australia is burning,” “Australia is on fire,” even, “Australia is committing climate suicide.” We have seen the photos: a fire tornado, evacuated townsfolk sheltering on a beach, kangaroos leaping for their lives, flames turning forests incandescent, cockatoos dropping dead out of scorching skies. And now the disaster is above our heads, eerily present though 1,400 miles away. It used to be that the symbol of climate change in the South Pacific was a drowning atoll; now it’s a burning continent.<!--

-->I board a plane to Adelaide, South Australia, and stumble on an inflight movie miniseries about Chernobyl. I watch it obsessively for the next four hours. Its relevance feels uncanny. A nuclear meltdown in preparation for a climate meltdown, each cataclysm surrounded by its own political ecosystem of deception and denial, promulgated, in the words of Chernobyl’s narrator, by “an entire congregation of obedient fools.” Chernobyl was madness. Climate change is madness. When do we reach a tipping point with this? When do we start to become sane?I walk across the tarmac and feel the dragon’s breath on my neck and scalp. The temperature is 99°F, and in two hours it will reach 106. The sky has the faded look of an atmosphere drained of moisture. A taxi takes me through the city’s outer suburbs into the country. A road sign points to a “bushfire last resort refuge.” The message is no exaggeration. In February 1983, on Ash Wednesday, deadly fires swept across the outskirts of Adelaide and other parts of the states of South Australia and Victoria, destroying thousands of homes, killing hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle, and taking the lives of 65 people, including 17 firefighters. Black Saturday, in February 2009, was even deadlier, killing 173 people. Some of the individual fires in those events spread at speeds exceeding 70 mph. People driving at the speed limit on freeways watched the fire front pass them. This season’s bushfires have so far burned across 65,000 square miles, an area the size of Florida, destroyed more than 2,200 homes, and killed 28 people. A billion animals may have perished.A dusty driveway on a parched hillside leads me to the home of the founders of SAVEM (South Australian Veterinary Emergency Management), a volunteer organization formed in the wake of Black Saturday to provide a coordinated response to retrieve, triage, and treat farm animals, pets, and wildlife during an emergency. Veterinarians from local practices are gathering here for a three-day deployment on Kangaroo Island, 70 miles from Adelaide, which has been ravaged since fires spread catastrophically on Friday, January 3.<!--

-->Emilis Prelgauskas, who handles logistics for the group, greets me at the door with his two greyhounds. He says that what’s been happening on the island, which is about 90 miles long and 55 at its widest point, is unprecedented. “No one expected 30 percent of Kangaroo Island to burn in one go,” he says. “This level of destruction has not been contemplated. We’re talking about a new reality. And if we don’t get significant rain, which we may not get until May, then this fire will continue until May.”He says that the work the volunteers will be doing is dangerous, complex, and traumatic. “The fire of January 3 may have burned 85 percent of animals on the fire ground—[live]stock and wildlife. Either killed them outright or took them so close to death that the kindest thing you can do is put a bullet through them. And yes, our teams have been using bullets. The truth is that a wild animal that has been traumatized by the fire, traumatized by its injuries—are you going to traumatize it more with human handling? This is about the welfare of the animal, not about making ourselves feel good.”The team is ready. They're taking a private plane made available by a supporter. They drop me at the airport for my commercial flight.Oliver Funnell, another SAVEM veterinarian, is booked on the same small turboprop plane. I ask him about the challenges of treating large, wild animals. He says it’s almost impossible to hospitalize and treat an adult kangaroo. They’re too big and too flighty. “They’d probably kill themselves if you tried to contain them, and might kill or injure you as well,” he says.Koalas’ habitat extends along Australia’s eastern coast, where a large number of bushfires are burning. The iconic marsupials move slowly, and their only defense against fire is climbing higher into the eucalyptus trees where they make their homes. Packed with oil, these trees detonate in spectacular explosions during extreme wildfires. Koalas are not at risk of extinction as a result of the fires because they have such a broad range. They have, nonetheless, been hit particularly hard.Koalas have their own challenges. “They’re incredibly fussy and require large amounts of very specific browse,” he says. “What’s more, browse they happily chewed yesterday they may reject today.” Continent-wide, koalas have been among the hardest hit of Australia’s native mammals in the fires because they’re slow moving and eat only eucalyptus leaves, which are filled with aromatic oils, making each tree a fire starter and flamethrower.We climb out of Adelaide into a smoke bank that lasts all the way to Kangaroo Island. I’ve been told that the January 3 fire was so hot it melted concrete at a luxury lodge, where staff survived by sheltering in a bunker. It caused flakes of granite to peel from the Remarkable Rocks, a tourist attraction in Flinders Chase National Park. That park is now mostly ash. “Pompeii,” one wildlife rescuer calls it. Flinders Chase celebrated its 100th anniversary in October 2019. Some anniversary present.A blood-red moon rises through the smoke haze east of Flour Cask Bay, on the south coast of the island. Motel owner John Hofmann and I watch flecks of ash drift past on the breeze. Kangaroos are sipping from water bowls he has set out nearby. They move cautiously, walking in an awkward combination of diminutive elbows and massive hind legs. But when they hop, they’re grace incarnate.“We may have to evacuate,” Hofmann warns. The fire authorities have issued a “watch and act” notification for this area as winds blow the fire front in our direction.Ninety percent of Kangaroo Island’s timber plantations have been burned since December, including hundreds of acres of highly flammable eucalyptus.Unbeknown to us, across the world, on American late-night television, Patti Smith reads a poem about “fires raging the Earth” and sings Neil Young’s 50-year-old song “After the Gold Rush,” updating the last line to “Mother Nature on the run in the 21st century.” It could be an anthem for an island on fire.I am awakened by Hofmann’s footsteps on the veranda. He knocks on the glass door. “Time to go,” he calls. He’s loading a trailer with camping equipment, food, water, torches, a generator. Who knows when we’ll be coming back. I stand with his sister and brother-in-law, the only other guests, facing an orange glow in the sky. It’s very warm, very quiet. The ash has stopped falling. Notifications say that the fire is threatening the airport. The road to Kingscote, the island’s main town of 1,800 people, has been closed. Our part of the island is cut off. We deliberate. Hofmann, a trained firefighter, looks at the wind forecast. It’s still blowing from the west, in our direction, but is predicted to swing south. That will reduce the danger. We have an evacuation route to the coast if the fire flares. Should we stay or go?“I think we go,” Hofmann says. I follow his four-by-four to Penneshaw, the island’s second largest settlement, on the eastern peninsula. We pull into a sportsground and line up with other vehicles and tents. I push the car seat back and try to sleep.A flock of shrieking corellas, a loud-mouthed species of cockatoo, land in a nearby tree, ending any prospect of further rest. The road to Kingscote has reopened, so I follow a fleet of emergency rescue vehicles traveling in that direction. I find my way to a café called Cactus, where the servers alternate between taking orders and hugging customers. At times like this, cafés provide as much therapy as they do sustenance. One server tells me she isn’t supposed to be working today, “but when people are coming in who have lost everything, you want to be here.” The editor of the island newspaper arrives and orders breakfast. He’s been working round the clock, keeping the community up to date and positive. “It’s on us, Stan,” she says. “So is the kale smoothie.”There’s a stream of army reservists, firefighters, farm support people, park rangers, media coming through the doors. I strike up a conversation with a local family and within minutes am taken to their home, where they’re looking after a kangaroo joey and a young brushtailed possum. The possum is in a bird cage. The joey hops around the living room. Robyn Karran steps into the garden to pick roses, which the possum gobbles greedily. Her daughter, Lisa, a wildlife rescuer who is married to the local policeman, shows me photos of animals they’ve helped. She estimates they’re driven 600 miles around the island since the fires began, picking up survivors.“There’s not a lot of life out there,” Lisa says. What there is can break your heart—animals frozen in the moment the fire took them, a baby koala still holding a eucalyptus branch, blown out of its tree. “This little guy,” she says, showing me a photo of a kangaroo joey, “was out of the pouch but still suckling on mum. There was no food around. They would have starved to death. I jumped on him and took him back to the car, but found that his feet were burned down to the bone. He wouldn’t have survived. So I had to say goodbye to him. That crushed me.” She left food and water for the mother and took the joey to Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park to be euthanized.She says that sometimes, as they drive around, they can’t even tell where they are. “It all looks the same. Vaporized.” Normal fires leave tree skeletons standing in the landscape. In some areas, this fire has left little more than matchsticks and ash.While I’m talking to the Karrans, at a press conference in Kingscote, the island’s mayor, Michael Pengilly, tells reporters there is no connection between the fires and a changing climate.I drive west through the town of Parndana to Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, which escaped destruction when Friday’s fires swept through the center of the island. Smoke is still billowing across the highway. Rows of round hay bales in a paddock smolder, some of them reduced to charred lumps. Melted roadside markers bend over like drooping flowers. Road signs are unreadable. A vineyard, every vine, every leaf scorched, a support post still on fire. I want to call someone. “Put it out.” But flare-ups much worse than this have incinerated more than 800 square miles of Kangaroo Island so far.It’s a miracle that the wildlife park is still intact, the animals alive. Fires raged on three sides but didn’t join up. Staff have converted a dining area into a field hospital, and the SAVEM veterinarians are changing the dressings on koalas’ feet. Three medics to an animal, working steadily through the patients. An anesthetic injection to reduce the handling trauma, then the feet are unwrapped, swabbed, smeared with antiseptic cream, and rebandaged. A saline drip is connected to hydrate the animals, and a painkiller popped into their mouths. New victims arrive in wheelbarrows as the treated koalas are moved to hastily erected pens. There they sit, shell-shocked, on eucalyptus branches. Traumatized, but alive.Richard Glatz, an entomologist, inhabits a world of smaller creatures, ones less thought about when disaster strikes. I drive to his home in D’Estrees Bay, which he shares with Janine Mackintosh, an assemblage artist who draws her materials and inspiration from the 800 acres of woodland, heathland, and wetland that surround them on the island’s south coast. She feels fiercely protective toward these natural landscapes.Today their own home needs protecting. The doors and windows are covered with aluminium insulation, to reflect heat if fire approaches. The previous night, the two had packed their vehicles with their most precious possessions and parked them in a farm field near a dam. Glatz had made sure he had access to the ceiling space in his research hut where he stores tens of thousands of insect specimens, so he could fight a fire if it broke out there.He shows me the collection, pulling out glass-topped trays of specimens neatly pinned and labeled, each a work of the entomologist’s art, a meticulous record of life in this place. He points to a moth named after him, Aenigmatinea glatzella, the enigma moth. Its name refers to the puzzling time taxonomists had in figuring out where it fit in the moth lineage. Endemic to the island, it’s so ancient as to be classified in a family by itself.Gorgeous, much larger eastern bronze azure butterflies are arrayed next to the enigmas. These butterflies lay their eggs on the nests of a single species of ant. When the eggs hatch, the ants appear to be fooled into taking the larvae down into the nest, where they are either fed by the ants, or, it is speculated, eat the ants’ own offspring. The butterfly larvae pupate in the nest, then emerge briefly to mate and start the cycle again. Glatz says that at this time of year the larvae are still underground. Have they survived the broiling heat of the fires?Glatz picks another insect out of its tray: a green carpenter bee, one of more than a hundred native species of bee on the island and one for which he has a special fondness. Extinct in mainland South Australia and Victoria, it persists in a few sites on Kangaroo Island and in the ranges around Sydney. Metallic green, twice the size of a honeybee, it’s a showy creature with a reclusive lifestyle: It drills into the dead flower stalks of yacca, the iconic Australian grass tree, which looks like a giant green pompom, and into the rotting trunks of old banksia trees to make its nests—hence the name carpenter.The banksias are crucial, Glatz says. While yaccas recover and flower quickly after a fire, their flower stalks soon disintegrate, and the plants may not flower again for years. The carpenter bees need the longstanding banksias to carry them through multiple seasons. Glatz wants to see if the banksias are still standing after the fires and invites me to join him the next day as he searches for survivors.The entomologist, the artist, and the reporter drive westward. We take two vehicles for safety. We pass a flock of dove-grey Cape Barren geese in a paddock. We pass charred beehives. Close to a thousand commercial beehives have been lost on Kangaroo Island. When a hive burns, the beeswax melts, and the honey streams out. One beekeeper found to his dismay that birds called New Holland honeyeaters had come to the river of sweetness, become stuck in the thickening honey, and died.We come to Church Road—I can just make out the blistered letters on the blackened street sign. But this is not Church Road, this is “desolation row.” Beside the geometrically straight lines of a burned eucalyptus plantation, the ground is scattered with koala bodies. Like pandas, koalas are a global emblem of all that is endearing in the natural world. Their charred, furless bodies lie in the ashes at my feet. According to one of the owners of Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, half the Island’s estimated 50,000 koalas may have succumbed.Farther up the road, we stop at the property of some of Glatz’s and Mackintosh’s friends. The home is a pile of rubble covered with the twisted iron of the fallen roof. The windows have exploded, blasting glass hundreds of feet away. The roof of a garage on the property has been blown across the road, ending up wrapped around the skeletons of trees. Plastic water tanks have melted like toffee.The property next door has fared no better. We see something that touches us deeply. A row of salvaged coffee cups has been set out on a sheet of iron and filled with water. Even in the total loss of their homes, the owners have made sure that there is water for heat-parched animals and birds. Next to what was the house is an orchard enclosed in wire netting to protect the harvest from fruit-loving creatures. The trees—laden with nectarines, apples, plums—are scorched brown, the fruit shrunken but still holding on. As the owners turned away from the ruins, they opened the gate to the orchard so that birds could have the fruit.We return to our vehicles solemn, distressed, moved by acts of kindness. My companions remark on the silence. Normally, the birdsong here would be constant, they say. Now the only sound is an indifferent wind sighing in the darkened trees.We drive west to the entrance of Kelly Hill Conservation Area, one of Glatz’s carpenter bee sites, and walk a few hundred yards through an ash landscape, looking for the host trees. But the old banksia trunks have gone. We don’t see a single one. It’s a serious blow: By such deletions species are lost, and ecosystems unravel.Yet there is life here. The fire has opened the cones of a small shrub, the endemic Kangaroo Island conestick, and they’re spilling white seeds onto the ashy soil. Glatz kneels to pick some up. One of the fears ecologists have is that with a fire of this intensity the seed banks that hold the key to regrowth may be destroyed, heated beyond their tolerance. Veronica Bates, a botanist on the island, tells me that it will take an autumn, winter, and spring before they know which seeds have survived and can form the basis of a vegetation recovery.That much of Australia’s flora is fire-adapted is common knowledge. What isn’t as widely appreciated is that historical fires typically burned with less ferocious heat. South Australians tell me repeatedly that these latest fires are not comparable. They have arisen in the midst of fire seasons that have increased from six months to nine. They’re more like furnaces than fires. Yes, there will be recovery. But what will be lost? Bates tells me something hard to believe: that farms in the western half of Kangaroo Island were once marginal in winter because they were too wet. That seems a distant memory now. Looking at the stricken landscape at Kelly Hill, I wonder if Glatz’s carpenter bees are just a memory too.Wildlife ecologist Pat Hodgens takes me into a forest remnant on the north coast, one of the few recorded locations of the Kangaroo Island dunnart, a mouse-size marsupial on the verge of extinction. The species is known from only 13 sites in western Kangaroo Island, Hodgens says, and all of those locations have now been burned, some beyond recognition. This one was lucky. It burned in the December fire, but that turned out to be a blessing in disguise, Hodgens says. The resulting loss of undergrowth meant less fuel was available for ignition by the more intense blaze of January 3, and the site was spared. We’re in ironstone country—the name for the iron-rich soils that cover much of the island. Ironstone is a geological lightning rod, and it was a lightning strike that ignited the fires that so far have burned almost half the island.“I saw the thunderstorm approaching,” he says, “and I thought, Here we go. This could be the end. No one could have predicted what happened last Friday—that every other dunnart site would be fried.”With so much of the surrounding bush now destroyed, a different pressure has come to bear: predators, especially feral cats, the most severe predators of Kangaroo Island’s native wildlife. “When a predator-naive marsupial goes up against a highly evolved predator like a cat, it doesn’t stand a chance,” Hodgens tells me.In the coming weeks, a six-foot-high cat-proof fence will be installed around this critical habitat. Meanwhile, Hodgens and his partner, Heidi Groffen, have installed two types of cat trap to give the dunnarts, bandicoots, and other marsupials a chance. We check several cage traps, which Hodgens baits with chicken wings. We find no trapped cats but liberate two goannas. The two-foot-long lizards streak away into what little undergrowth remains. Hodgens shows me a more high-tech device called a Felixer grooming trap, designed to identify a feral cat passing in front of it and shoot a blob of toxic paste onto the animal’s fur. The cat licks the paste and dies.I follow Hodgens through charred shrubbery where he checks the memory cards of motion-activated trail cameras. He shades a camera screen, and we make out the shape of a dunnart that has snuffled past in the night. This is thrilling news—the species lives. Yet even this relief feels fragile and provisional.As we drive back to the road, Hodgens voices a frustration. “People often say, ‘The bush always comes back. It will regenerate. Fire’s natural. It’s all good. Mother Nature knows best.’ This isn’t Mother Nature. This isn’t natural at all. The bush doesn’t come back. Superficially, yes, it will look green, it will have flowers and birds, but it might not have dunnarts in it ever again unless we can take care of the remnants we’ve got. Dunnarts need a variety of habitats. They need old growth, they need thick undergrowth, they need a bit of everything. We don’t know if they will recover from this.”A concert has been organized to lift the islanders’ spirits. One singer steps to the microphone and says, “My name’s Craig. I was born here. I’ve lost everything. Here’s a song about that.”He's followed by Glatz, who sings Ben Folds's song "Smoke" and, true to his profession, one about a housefly and a typewriter. At one point during the evening, the audience chants in unison: "Bring back the bush."I meet the couple with the orchard in Church Road. Tomorrow they’re taking out food pellets and hay for the wallabies. “We’ve still got survivors coming out of the bush,” they say. “They’re our priority.”On my way to the airport, I visit a clifftop archaeological site called Red Banks, one of dozens of sites around the island where the first people left evidence of an occupation that stretches back more than 10,000 years. I would like to ask those people about how to live endure, how to survive on this island, on this Earth. I think they would start by saying that humans are not separate from nature—that land, waters, people, plants, animals are one living tissue.At my feet, half-inch-long ants are busy around the entrance to their nest. I don’t know the temperament of these insects, so I keep my distance. In the Aboriginal world, they are my kin, and I am their custodians. As Aboriginal writer Tyson Yunkaporta puts it: “This is why we’re here. We look after things on the earth and in the sky and the places in between.”It strikes me that pretty much everyone I’ve met on Kangaroo Island is “looking after things”—from firefighters to café servers, koala rescuers to dunnart ecologists, dedicated vets to devastated homeowners who give water and fruit to wildlife. How do we begin to do this when it’s not an emergency? Or when it’s a permanent emergency? The past decade, 2010 to 2019, has been the planet’s hottest on record, and the thermometer’s not going down.At the departure gate for my flight to Auckland, I see a TV screen playing an interview with Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister. The interviewer has just challenged him with a comment from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull that "if ever there was a crisis not to waste, it is this one." Morrison dismisses the comment, stressing the importance of a strong economy and "Australia’s broader national interests"—such as being the world's leading exporter of coal. I remark to passengers watching next to me about the logic of needing to make lots of money from climate-damaging industries to fund the recovery that results from climate-damaging industries.I watch the final episode of Chernobyl on the flight home. The narrator confronts the seeming futility of his profession as a scientist. “To be a scientist is to be naive. We are so focused on our search for the truth we fail to consider how few actually want us to find it. But it is always there, whether we see it or not, whether we choose to or not.” Isn’t this the story of climate science?Some people—including even former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev—think Chernobyl was the tipping point that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, overturning an establishment based on secrets and lies. What will be the tipping point that awakens humanity to its present condition, ending the denial of the climate crisis? Chernobyl caused the Soviet people to question the political reality of their times. Their government could not, would not protect them. They came to see the system as irredeemable. How many fires does it take to get to that point?",
"A koala is pictured in Queensland, Australia. The iconic marsupials have an extensive habitat range along Australia’s eastern coast, where a large number of bushfires are burning.Australia is in the midst of a catastrophic and unprecedented early fire season. As dozens of bushfires rage up the country’s eastern coast, from Sydney to Byron Bay, incinerating houses, forest, and even marshland, one of Australia’s most iconic animals has taken center stage in headlines.A female koala, named Anwen by her rescuers, receives treatment at the Koala Hospital in Port Macquarie, Australia. She was burnt in a brushfire ravaging the area.Images of burned, dying koalas have emerged as a symbol of the fire’s devastating toll. “They’re such helpless little things,” says Christine Adams-Hosking, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Queensland in Australia. “A bird can fly, a kangaroo can hop very fast, but koalas are so slow. They basically just get stuck where they are.”The plight of the defenseless animals has sparked a flurry of concern—and confusion. Over the weekend, erroneous declarations that the animals have lost most of their habitat and are “functionally extinct” made the rounds in headlines and on social media, illustrating just how quickly misinformation can spread in times of crisis.Koalas are considered vulnerable to extinction—just a step above endangered—and reports indicate that between 350 and a thousand koalas have been found dead so far in fire-devastated zones of northern New South Wales.But, experts say, we are not looking at the death of a species—yet. “We’re not going to see koalas go extinct this fast,” says Chris Johnson, professor of wildlife conservation at the University of Tasmania. “Koala populations will continue to decline because of lots of interacting reasons, but we’re not at the point where one event could take them out.”Here’s the current situation:When it comes to fire, everything seems to be stacked against koalas. Their only real defense is climbing higher into the eucalyptus trees where they make their homes—little defense at all in a raging forest fire.Volunteers from the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital search for injured koalas after a brushfire ripped through prime breeding grounds.Koala Hospital staff tend to the injuries of Peter, a male koala found severely dehydrated and in shock, with badly burnt paws, feet, and ears. If he is successfully rehabilitated, he will be returned to the wild.Eucalyptus itself is some of the most fire-adapted vegetation on Earth, able to sprout and grow anew in the immediate aftermath of fires. In normal fire conditions, the flames wouldn’t typically reach the top of the trees, leaving the koalas relatively unscathed. The spike we’re seeing in koala deaths is an indicator that something is wrong, says David Bowman, director of the Fire Center Research Hub at the University of Tasmania.The scale of the current fires—largely a result of climate change and the slow death of Aboriginal fire management methods—has no precedent, according to Bowman. “They are burning at a particularly high intensity,” he says.Packed with oil, the trees are burning hot and fast, sometimes exploding and sending sparks yards in every direction.It’s only the spring in Australia. “In terms of then bushfire crisis, this is the supporting act,” Bowman says. He worries that the situation will be far worse come in January and February, as temperatures continue to rise and drought is exacerbated.In 2016, experts estimated that there are about 329,000 koalas in Australia, which represents an average of a 24 percent decline in populations over the past three generations.“It’s very difficult to estimate koala populations, even at the best of times,” Adams-Hosking says, because they have a very wide range across eastern Australia, and are human-shy and found very high up in trees. “Some populations are becoming locally extinct and others are doing just fine.”Koalas are threatened by land development, food degradation (increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has diminished the nutritional quality of eucalyptus leaves), drought, dog attacks, and chlamydia. (Read more about the threats posed by cars and dogs.)And, yes, fire too. In certain areas that have been hard hit by fire, it’s possible that local koala populations won’t recover, “but it’s too early to tell,” says Adams-Hosking. “We’d need monitoring over several years.”No. Koalas’ range is large, extending along Australia’s entire Eastern coast. The recent bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland cover about a million hectares, Fisher says (and some estimates indicate as many as 2.5 million hectares), but the area of forest in eastern Australia where koalas can live is more than 100 million hectares.Koala Hospital volunteers found this mother and her baby searching for food and water on the ground in the Port Macquarie fire zone. The pair, named Julie and Joey, are now receiving care at the hospital.Furthermore, just because an area has been affected by fire, says Grant Williamson, a postdoctoral fellow specializing in landscape ecology at the University of Tasmania, “does not mean it has been ‘destroyed’ and is no longer suitable for occupation by koalas.”“Functionally extinct” refers to when a species no longer has enough individual members to produce future generations or play a role in the ecosystem. (Learn more: What is extinction? The answer is complicated.)The fires may have killed many koalas “but this is not enough to change their overall threat status as a species,” Fisher says.The headlines claiming that koalas are functionally extinct appear to be based on a claim from a koala conservation group earlier in 2019. Scientists disputed it then and continue to dispute it now: “It is threatened in some parts of its range and not in others,” says Diana Fisher, associate professor in the school of biological sciences at the University of Queensland.For some local populations of koalas in the fire zones, especially in northern New South Wales, the impact has likely been “catastrophic,” Adams-Hosking says. A third of koalas in the fire zones there may have perished.But other populations, such as those in the southern state of Victoria, have not been affected by these fires at all, according to Johnson.“It’s not looking good for koalas at all, even before the fires,” says Adams-Hosking. While they have government protections—it’s illegal to kill a koala, for instance—their habitat is highly vulnerable, she says. “Very little of koala habitat is designated as protected area. Almost nothing.” She argues that the government needs to put the environment before economic growth. “Until that political will kicks in—and in Australia, it hasn’t—it’s not going to get any better for koalas.”In the meantime, The Koala Hospital of Port Macquarie, located about 250 miles north of Sydney in one of the most fire-affected zones, is actively rescuing and treating koalas. To date, they’ve treated at least 22, according to the New York Times.  Adams-Hosking and David Bowman, the landscape fire expert, both argue that in addition to protecting land, it’s vital to start looking at rewilding and relocating koalas. “We’ve got to get with the program and start adapting, says Bowman. “If we want koalas, we’ve got to look after them. We need to step up.”",
"Koalas are declining in Australia due to habitat loss and human encroachment.Australia's iconic koala has a problem that keeps boomeranging back.Chlamydia, a type of sexually transmitted disease also found in humans, has hit wild koalas hard, with some wild populations seeing a 100 percent infection rate.The infectious bacteria usually aren't fatal, but they can severely impact a koala's health. That's a concern, as the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the fuzzy mammal vulnerable to extinction, mostly due to habitat loss.Young koalas in the pouch also get it from eating their mom's pap, a "very nutrient-dense fecal matter" that joeys eat after breastfeeding but before they start on eucalyptus leaves, she says. The pap may allow the koala's gut microbes to digest otherwise toxic tannins in eucalyptus, the species' main food source.For over two decades, scientists have brought wild koalas into wildlife hospitals to treat their chlamydia with antibiotics. The downside is that the antibiotics may be altering those gut microbes that allow koalas to eat eucalyptus, notes Katherine Dahlhausen, a doctoral student at the University of California, Davis.That's why Dahlhausen led a recent study investigating the microbiomes of koalas throughout the course of antibiotic treatment. She found that the presence of an unnamed bacterium, closely related to a known tannin degrader, Lonepinella koalarum, was a significant factor in whether a koala survives antibiotic treatment.This discovery may help her figure out how to keep the protective microbe alive in the koala during its course of antibiotics. (Read how super-gonorrhea is becoming more resistant to drugs.)What's more, a number of alternative treatments are possible, Dahlhausen notes. These may include a non-antibiotic approach, adding probiotics to treatment to restore the healthy bacteria, fecal transplants, in which stool from a healthy donor is transplanted to restore good bacteria, and a koala-specific chlamydia vaccine, which has done well in clinical trials.Alternative treatments are especially important, since handling infected wild koalas can stress them on top of their poor health."Any time you handle [a wild] animal, a certain amount of stress will decrease their immune function," says Dalen Agnew, associate professor in the department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation at Michigan State University.Koalas also must increasingly cope with an unreliable natural environment, such as drought brought on by climate change and the building of highways, which forces them out of trees and into the way of cars and predators. (Related: "Why Are Koalas Suddenly Drinking Extra Water?")Less living space can squeeze koalas into smaller, more isolated groups, making it harder to find food and mates that are healthy and genetically diverse.Have a question about the weird and wild world?

"Two joeys cling to each other at an animal hospital before being placed with human caregivers. Later on, they'll be released into the wild.

www.joelsartore.comIt’s two in the morning and a koala is caught in barbed wire on a fence, like a prisoner trying to escape. A phone rings in the home of Megan Aitken in Burpengary, a suburb north of Brisbane. Aitken, 42, runs a volunteer organization devoted to rescuing wild koalas from a surprisingly wide array of hazards. Before the dispatcher has even given her the location, she has thrown her clothes on over her pajamas.When Aitken arrives on the scene, Jane Davies and Sandra Peachey, two other volunteers, are already there. The koala is clinging to a chain-link fence, its fur snagged in horizontal strands of barbed wire. Towering eucalyptus trees, as pale as ghosts, rise on the far side of the fence.“He was obviously trying to get to the trees on the other side,” Aitken says.Standing in the bright cones of car headlights, Aitken pulls on heavy leather welding gloves. Despite their huggable, stuffed-animal appearance, koalas can be ferocious when resisting capture. They’ll growl, flail, fight, and bite like angry raccoons, and Aitken has the scars to prove it. Next she places a wire cage on the ground near the animal and opens up a thick blanket. Then the three rescuers rapidly get to work.Davies throws the blanket over the animal, both to calm it and to protect the rescuers from its teeth and claws. Peachey opens the lid of the cage, while Aitken firmly grasps the little black-nosed beast through the blanket, frees it from the fence, and drops it snarling and snapping into the cage.“Well done, ladies!” Aitken shouts.Looking down at the round-eyed koala they’ve just captured, Aitken considers a new problem. If this koala were sick or injured, they’d take it to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, 40 minutes north in Beerwah. But the animal is healthy. By protocol they must release it somewhere nearby, since koalas have a home range and feed in the same trees over and over. Yet this is Deception Bay, a densely populated suburb. The women study a street map with flashlights.“This is the whole problem,” Aitken says, exasperated. “There are so few places left for the koala.” In the end they take the animal several blocks to tiny Boama Park, which borders a stretch of open land reaching all the way to the beach. Deep in the night the women carry the cage through the trees, setting it below a gray-skinned eucalyptus. Standing back, they spring the lid of the cage, and the koala dashes up the trunk and disappears.“Good luck, little one,” Aitken says.The koala, cuddly symbol of a nation and one of the most beloved animals on the planet, is in crisis. Before Europeans settled Australia more than two centuries ago, about ten million koalas lived in a 1,500-mile-long swath of the east coast eucalyptus forests. Hunted for their luxurious fur, koalas were brought to the edge of extinction in the southern half of their range. In the northern half, Queensland, a million were killed in 1919 alone. After the last open season in Queensland was held in 1927, only tens of thousands remained.Through the next half century their numbers slowly rebounded, in part due to efforts to relocate and recolonize them. Then urbanization began to take its toll. Habitat was lost, and diseases spread. With urbanization came the threat of dogs and highways. Since 1990, when about 430,000 koalas inhabited Australia, their numbers have dropped sharply. Because surveys are difficult, current population estimates vary widely—from a low of 44,000 by advocacy groups to a high of 300,000 by government agencies. More than a decade ago a survey of the Koala Coast, a 93,000-acre region in southeastern Queensland, estimated a koala population of 6,200; today there are believed to be around 2,000.“Koalas are getting caught in fences and dying, being killed by dogs, struck by vehicles, even dying simply because a homeowner cut down several eucalyptus trees in his backyard,” says Deidré de Villiers, one of the chief koala researchers at the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management. For 15 years de Villiers, 38, has been tracking koalas, monitoring populations, studying the reasons for their decline, and creating guidelines to make development more koala-friendly.De Villiers insists that koalas and humans can coexist in urban environments “if developers get on board with koala-sensitive designs,” such as lower speed limits for streets, green corridors for koala movement, and, most especially, preserving every precious eucalyptus tree. Unfortunately, koalas have another problem.“Disease is the other huge issue,” says veterinarian Jon Hanger, 42, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Queensland. Hanger has discovered that as much as half of Queensland’s koala population may be affected by the sexually transmitted disease chlamydiosis. In some wild koala populations more than 50 percent of the sexually mature females are infertile. The genesis of the disease is unknown, but it manifests itself as urogenital and ocular disease and is transmitted through mating and birthing, as well as fighting among males. Unlike in humans, chlamydiosis in koalas is often fatal.“Koala populations that used to be vibrant and sustainable are becoming extinct,” says Hanger, who puts the blame squarely on the provincial government. “Queensland has failed miserably to do anything meaningful about the decline. The federal government needs to get involved and do it properly, listing the koala as vulnerable to extinction.” Such a designation might save the last remnants of critical koala habitat, he argues. Hanger is also part of a research team developing a chlamydia vaccine.A recent report presented to the Australian Senate made several recommendations to save the koalas, including listing the animals as threatened and vulnerable, funding a program to monitor koala populations, mapping their habitat, and managing federal and private lands to protect the koalas. Until such measures are taken, the efforts of grassroots koala emergency squads will continue to be essential.“The more koalas we lose, the more valuable each rescued koala becomes,” says Hanger.Deidré de Villiers takes the koalas’ plight personally. Visitors to her home in Loganholme, south of Brisbane, discover that the woman who is a respected koala researcher by day is a doting koala foster parent by night.“Ruby still sleeps in the basket hugging her teddy bear,” she says. The baby koala is cocooned in a cane picnic basket like an infant in a bassinet. “She was rescued from the jaws of a dog. You want to hold her?”De Villiers picks up Ruby and hands her to me, the koala’s needle-sharp claws piercing my neck and face. I wince, and de Villiers, whose arms are crosshatched with scratches, laughs.“She likes to have both hands and feet gripping something when she’s picked up,” she says. My lip is bleeding, so I hand the little beast back. De Villiers gently places Ruby onto a tree limb in her playpen in the dining room. Her playmate, Luna, another orphaned koala, is asleep in the crook of the branch. Through the glass doors of the dining room, out on the patio, a larger playpen is visible, and in the backyard stands a chain-link enclosure filled with trees.De Villiers is caring for five koalas at once: Ruby, Luna, Tia, Mr. T, and Munchie. Ruby is quiet, Luna is ticklish, Tia likes to jump, Mr. T is mischievous, and Munchie is aloof. Every other day de Villiers cuts and collects eucalyptus leaves, the koalas’ primary food, from a nearby plantation. During the past 12 years, she’s fostered more than 60 animals.“Ruby has to go to the hospital tomorrow,” she says. “She has a respiratory tract infection that’s not improving.”The next day she takes Ruby to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, a state-of-the-art facility that was built by Steve Irwin, the TV naturalist who died in 2006. Ruby is admitted, sedated, then anesthetized and intubated to feed oxygen and drugs to her lungs. Everything is efficient, orderly, and hyperclean.“She has a nasty case of pneumonia,” says Amber Gillett, 30, a vet who has worked here for six years. “It can be fatal, particularly for young koalas.”While de Villiers strokes the still-unconscious Ruby, Gillett flushes the koala’s lungs with a saline solution and takes a sample that is whisked to the lab for culturing. “I’d guess we have about a 70 percent success rate with pneumonia in koala joeys,” she says, as Ruby is wheeled off to the x-ray room. “I think this little one will make it.”The following afternoon Ruby’s back home, recuperating in a playpen with Luna. One morning not long after, de Villiers sets out into the scrubby forest near Lake Samsonvale, northwest of Brisbane, to catch Tee Vee, a wild koala the researcher has been monitoring for more than a year. The Department of Environment and Resource Management has relocated several koalas into Tee Vee’s territory, and de Villiers has been recording the impact on the local koala population. Using a receiver that resembles an old-fashioned rooftop TV antenna, she walks through second-growth bush, listening for a signal from the koala’s radio collar.She eventually picks up a faint signal and follows it over hill and dale as the beeping, like a koala Geiger counter, grows louder and louder.“I see her!” she says finally. A basketball-size gray lump is clinging to a branch of an ironbark tree 50 feet or so directly above.Capturing a koala high in the canopy is complicated. First a giant slingshot blasts a ball of string over a tree limb close to the koala. This may require several tries. The string is attached to a climbing rope, which is pulled up over the limb and tied off taut to the ground. A 30-foot ladder is then set against the tree. Someone must scale the ladder and inch up the rope, carrying a “flagging pole” like a trapeze artist.That someone is de Villiers, of course. Rigged out like a rock climber, she scrambles up the tree, agile as a koala herself. Dangling from a limb, she attempts to “flag” the koala, by flapping a flag of plastic or fabric attached to the end of the pole above its head. This annoys koalas, and Tee Vee starts shimmying backward down the trunk.But Tee Vee, as de Villiers says, “is an obstreperous handful.” Halfway down the tree, the koala runs out on a limb and cleverly jumps into another tree, starting the whole process over again.The second time Tee Vee backs down, she gets within 20 feet of the ground before freaking out, leaping into midair like a flying squirrel. But koalas are round and don’t fly. Tee Vee lands on the ground and is quickly captured with a blanket, screeching and clawing and biting like a little wolverine.After Tee Vee is sedated, de Villiers gets to work. Using a variety of instruments, she measures everything from the length of the koala’s body to the width of her skull, the size and wear of her teeth to the silkiness of her fur. Weight and general health are also noted.“I think she has a baby,” de Villiers says suddenly.And with that, she slips her finger into the downward-facing pouch, opens it up, and delicately draws out a four-inch-long, blind, furless, alien-looking creature with fully developed razor-sharp claws.A deep, spontaneous “ahhh” escapes from everyone present, even the rangers who have done this many times before.De Villiers deftly examines the infant and pouch for any signs of disease or abnormality, then softly pushes the joey back inside the sleeping mother.“While there are still healthy babies, there’s still hope,” she whispers.",
"The American pika (pictured, an animal in Wyoming's Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) is surprisingly resilient, adapting to warmer climates in its North American habitat.Extinction is a natural phenomenon: After all, more than 90 percent of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth aren’t alive today.But humans have made it worse, accelerating natural extinction rates due to our role in habitat loss, climate change, invasive species, disease, overfishing, and hunting.“We’re losing whole suites of species that have distinct ecological roles to play,” says Stuart Pimm, Professor of Conservation at Duke University. For instance, top predators such as sea otters and sharks have dwindled, throwing their ecosystems off-kilter.Dozens of new species go extinct every day, and scientists say that more than 20,000 plants and animals are on the brink of disappearing forever. A quarter of known mammal species is at risk of extinction.The main body that tracks species decline is the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The organization evaluates species in the wild, and, along with data from a variety of sources, categorizes their vulnerability on its Red List of Threatened Species.Here are some terms and concepts that biologists use when talking about extinction.These animals are facing a high probability of extinction. These species include the Sumatran rhinoceros and the Sumatran orangutan, whose habitat is being destroyed by logging and agriculture.These are species that no longer live in their native range, and exist only in captive environments such as zoos or breeding centers. In 1987, the 27 California condors left in the world were taken into captivity, making them extinct in the wild.A captive California condor is seen at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The bird was nearly extinct when humans intervened and captured the remaining wild animals.The Guam rail, a small, flightless bird, was nearly driven to extinction by the invasive brown tree snake, which was accidentally brought to the island by the U.S. military. The rails now live only in captive environments, including the National Aviary in Pittsburgh.This isn’t an IUCN category, but a term meaning an animal is gone from part of its native range. Grizzly bears are locally extinct in California, but still live in the wild in other areas.A mother grizzly keeps watch at Lake Clark National Park in Alaska. The predator is locally extinct in California, part of its former range.The American pika, a cold-loving relative of rabbits, is often erroneously reported to be moving to higher locations as the climate warms. It's true that the species is locally extinct—also referred to as extirpated—in some areas within the Great Basin Mountains of the western U.S, but a 2018 study in the journal Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research found that pikas are adaptable, and still persist throughout the region.“Pikas can be highly resilient, and continue to surprise us by their occupancy at hot, low-elevation sites,” Andrew Smith, co-chair of the IUCN Lagomorph Specialist Group, says via email. This species is listed as "of least concern" on the IUCN Red List.In New England, less snowy winters are allowing a species of tick to live longer, which is in turn killing off the region's moose. With their skinny necks, emaciated bodies, and big, hairless splotches, these "ghost moose" look like the walking dead as they stumble through the forest.A female moose and her calf wade through a lake in Maine.This term means there are too few members of a species to perform its function in the ecosystem, says Steve Beissinger, a professor of conservation biology at the University of California, Berkeley.For instance, American chestnut trees were once widespread throughout North America, but a fungus killed 3.5 billion of them in the early 20th century. A few trees survived, making the species functionally extinct.This IUCN category means a species is “globally extinct,” or “gone everywhere,” Beissinger says, a determination made after time and exhaustive searches in their habitat.Hunting and habitat loss likely wiped out the colorful Carolina parakeet, which was once abundant in the U.S. and is now officially extinct. These birds were especially vulnerable since they didn’t flee gunfire, but stayed with their wounded comrades, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Sometimes animals thought to be extinct emerge alive, often thanks to targeted surveys in remote habitats.These so-called “Lazurus species” usually haven’t been seen in decades in their normal ranges, but may turn up in an unexpected place or just be hard to detect due to low populations.In 2010, Conservation International and the IUCN's Amphibian Specialist Group launched an effort to seek out 10 extinct amphibian species of high scientific and aesthetic value. The search did rediscover a few species, including the Hula painted frog.Sometimes species are endangered even as they’re discovered.The Manduriacu glass frog of the Ecuadorian Andes was newly discovered in mining area, so its survival is already dubious.",
"The Manduriacu glass frog (Nymphargus manduriacu) lives in a reserve in northern Ecuador and is threatened by mining.Alongside a pristine stream in the foothills of the Ecuadorian Andes, a team of researchers has found a graceful glass frog that's new to science.Unlike its close relatives, this amphibian has abundant yellow spots on its back, and unique webless fingers. As with other glass frogs, this species has somewhat translucent skin, lives most of its life in trees, and descends to the water to breed.The researchers have dubbed it the Manduriacu glass frog (Nymphargus manduriacu), named after its home, the Río Manduriacu Reserve. It’s found only within a small patch of a single river valley, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet. Males of the species emit high-pitched chirps to find mates.Even though the animal lives within a private reserve, the area is part of a mining concession. Exploration for gold and copper already threatens its continued survival, according to the study, published recently in the journal PeerJ.The creation of mining concessions has “increased at an alarming rate” in the country, says study lead author Juan Manuel Guayasamin Ernest, a researcher at Universidad San Francisco de Quito. This frog is one of many species that could be imperiled by this activity, much of which is taking place in the Andes, home to many endemic and as-yet unrecorded species.In Ecuador, companies can obtain rights from the government to underground resources like gold, even on land they do not own. They are, however, legally required to consult with the landowners—in this case, a conservation group called Fundacion EcoMinga—and the local community.That didn’t happen in this case. The government sold the concession to Cerro Quebrado, a subsidiary of the world’s largest mining company, Australia-based BHP. (BHP didn’t respond to a request for comment.)That could open up the company to a lawsuit, says Esteban Falconi, an environmental and human rights attorney in Ecuador. But the court system is influenced by the executive branch, which has pushed mining in recent years after oil development failed to prop up the economy as hoped, explains Roo Vandegrift, an ecologist at the University of Oregon who has worked in the country.Like all glass frogs, the newfound creature has somewhat translucent skin and lives in trees.Corruption has been a problem in Ecuador, and large companies exert influence in the country, which has to date been spared the large-scale mining projects seen in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Ecuador’s former vice president, Jorge Glas, was sentenced in December 2017 to six years in prison for corruption. In that case, Glas was convicted of accepting $13.5 million in bribes from a Brazilian construction company.The new push for mining alarms conservationists, as this type of extraction has had “devastating impacts” in other countries within the Amazon Basin, Vandegrift says. It also goes against Ecuador’s constitution, which, unlike any other, grants certain unalienable rights to nature.An ensatina salamander (Ensatina eschscholtzii eschscholtzii).The researchers recommend that the newly discovered glass frog be listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.For conservationists involved, it’s emblematic of the larger threat facing Ecuador’s rare animals from mining.There are nearly 600 known amphibian species in the country, and perhaps 20 percent or more remain undescribed, says Luis Coloma, director of the Jambatu Center for Research and Conservation of Amphibians in Ecuador, who wasn’t part of the team that wrote the paper.The study serves as “a loud outcry to protect this new species and other critically endangered amphibians… especially from mining activities,” Coloma says.",
"Men on the edge of Iran's dried-up Lake Urmia. From National Geographic magazine's March 2018 story, "Some of the World's Biggest Lakes Are Drying Up. Here's Why."A report published today by NOAA and NASA confirmed that 2010 to 2019 was the hottest decade since record keeping began 140 years ago. The analysis also revealed that 2019 was the second hottest year ever recorded and that ocean temperatures were the highest they’ve ever been. The scientists behind the report point to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as the sources of continued global warming.These hotter temperatures helped fuel a slew of natural disasters as the world finally confronted the realities of climate change. The research is the latest to confirm that conditions could worsen unless action to reduce emissions are taken.This decade, many people around the world woke up to a grim reality: Climate change is here, it’s happening now, and it could very easily get much, much worse.These 10 years were punctuated by a series of deadly, dramatic, devastating events. Hurricanes like Sandy, Maria, and Harvey fundamentally changed the communities they barreled into, leaving behind scars that have yet to heal. Stronger and stronger heat waves forced communities across the country and world into dangerous swelter. Wildfires tore up hundreds of thousands of acres in a flash.Climate records fell left and right. Hottest-ever year for the planet’s atmosphere? Check. Hottest-ever year for its oceans? Also check. Puny, unprecedentedly tiny stretches of Arctic sea ice? Check, check, check.The underlying force beneath the changes is indisputable. Steadily increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, are trapping extra heat near Earth’s surface. That warms Earth as a whole. The outcome is both straightforward—a hotter planet—and incredibly complex, as changes cascade through the oceans, atmosphere, soil, rocks, trees, and every living thing on the planet.“God, this was a terrible decade,” says Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Let’s make the next one less bad.”The last decade was the hottest ever recorded, flashing a warning sign to anyone who was paying attention. On average, the annual temperatures over the years hover a little less than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) higher now than they did from 1950 to 1980; the last five years alone was the hottest stretch ever recorded. So far, 2019 is shaping up to be the second hottest year ever, about 1.7 degrees F (0.94 degree C) above that long-term average.That number might not sound like much, but its effects are large. Each little shift in the average increases the likelihood of extreme hot events. And just little shifts in the overall amount of heat stored in the oceans, air, and water can have huge effects on the planet.For example, scientists think the planet was only about 10.8 degrees F colder (6 degrees C), on average, during the last ice age 20,000 or so years ago. But at that time a huge ice sheet covered North America, extending as far south as Long Island. The world looked very different, and there was only a small change in average temperature.The hottest hot temperatures are also creeping higher—exactly what scientists would expect. As the average shifts upward, the likelihood of the extremely hot moments grows. Sure enough, “extreme” heat events have come with more frequency in the past decade, and that pattern is only expected to intensify.There’s another important dimension to the overall warming, which is that it’s not happening evenly over the year or over distances. Winters are warming up faster than summers. The change in minimum temperatures between 2009 and 2018 (the last ten years that we have records for; 2019 records do not exist yet) was 1.34 degrees F. With milder winters come a whole host of unsettling, ecosystem-reshaping changes: Earlier springs cause a mismatch between pollinators and plant flowering times. More rain and less snow, and earlier-melting snow, affect water availability through the summer and fall. Unfrozen lakes, thawing permafrost, and open water appear where there should be ice.Equally alarming and even more notable change is apparent in the oceans. While air temperatures tend to wobble around from year to year, responding to big patterns like El Niño—the periodic Pacific water-warming weather event—the ocean smooths out the signal, integrating all the warming that’s happened over past years. It responds more slowly and more steadily to changes happening above its surface, and what it’s telling us is clear.The ocean has sucked up over 90 percent of all the extra heat trapped by human-caused climate change, and that signal is already apparent in its surface temperatures. Marine heat waves, like the heat waves we feel on land, and bigger changes—ones that could affect weather patterns around the entire planet—may be coming sooner than we think.Earth’s ice served as the most obvious signpost of change over the past decade. The Arctic experienced about 1.8 F degrees (1 degree C) of warming in the past decade alone—compared to just under 1 degree C for the planet at large over the past 50 years. And its ice and frozen landscapes are responding just as sensitively as scientists predicted they would.In 2012, nearly the entire Greenland ice sheet turned to slush, gushing cascades of melt into its coastal waters. Then the softening happened again, and again. Arctic sea ice bottomed out at its lowest ever recorded extent in 2012 as well, and has hovered at historic lows ever since, distorting “normal” weather patterns that depend on Arctic cold.West Antarctica’s towering glaciers, home to enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 feet or more if they melted, have begun an inexorable retreat. Almost every single glacier in Earth’s high mountains is shrinking now, reshaping life in those high elevation zones. It’s also hitting life far downstream, where billions of people depend on the water that has long been sourced from snow and ice in the high peaks above.Both ocean-trapped heat and melting ice contributed to record-breaking sea levels across much of the planet. A warmer ocean expands, driving those levels higher, and simultaneously, melt from Greenland and Antarctica has added about 36 millimeters of extra fresh water to the world’s oceans in the past 10 years, and the rate is jacking up every year. The injection of fresh water is changing the composition of the ocean in the Far North, which is in turn slowing down the conveyor belt of current from north to south that controls the world’s weather, with uncertain—but not positive—effects.Behind all of the change is one clear driver: atmospheric carbon dioxide. In 2009, atmospheric CO2 concentrations hovered around 390 parts per million. By 2014, the number blew past 400 parts per million. Today, we hover around 410 ppm. The planet hasn’t seen concentrations that high since at least 2.6 million years ago. And at that time, no ice sheet existed in the northern polar regions and forests grew on Antarctica, sea levels were likely more than 40 feet higher than today, and the planet as a whole operated under very different conditions.“This last decade mattered a lot and it looked pretty bad,” says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at Columbia University and NASA GISS. “We’ve just got to make it so the next one is different.”The physical patterns of climate change are becoming clearer and clearer. Alongside those physical changes, attitudes are also shifting.Throughout the 2000s, explains Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Americans were engaged with the question of climate change. A 2007 IPCC report stoked conversation about how to deal with the issue, as did political communities. Scientists were speaking out.But even the belief that climate was changing—let alone whether solutions should be pursued—dropped precipitously in the U.S. between 2008 and 2010, for a suite of political and social reasons. The first part of the decade, Leiserowitz says, was spent rebuilding attention to and interest in climate change as a major issue.At the same time, scientists have developed new techniques to determine exactly how much more likely an event—from a hurricane to a heat wave to a wildfire—was because of climate change. They can link the wider patterns of change directly to a weather event. That kind of explicit linkage is changing the way people think about the broader issue, he says.Climate change supercharged Hurricane Harvey, for example, adding an extra 20 percent of rain to what might have been expected. Clear messaging that links the science with the impact influences the way people understand the causes of such events.In the past few years, public interest in and concern about climate change has increased dramatically. In 2010, 59 percent of the U.S. adults the Yale program surveyed thought global warming was happening; by this year, that number was up to 67 percent. In 2009, 31 percent of respondents thought global warming would harm them personally; by this year, that number was up to 42 percent.And in the past year, activity has exploded amongst young people. Youth climate activists are gathering, millions deep, to bring attention to their stolen futures. Scientific teams are issuing stronger and stronger warnings. Global attention to the problem and the potential solutions is growing. But at the same time, the action that’s been taken so far is far from enough.“A lot of people are starting to connect the dots,” says Leiserowitz. “Saying, oh my god, this event, is it climate change? And for a larger swath of the population, they’re starting to see it too, asking, ‘Huh, what’s going on with this record-setting event after record-setting event? Are these things connected?’”“It was a very bad decade,” says Stokes. “I’d say we lost nine years of the decade, but we really started getting somewhere in the last 12 months. There’s a whole new energy and dynamism,” and that, she says, could signal that the next decade in climate might, hopefully, be different than the last.",
"Tire tracks stretched across the flat lake bed to the horizon. We followed them in a Suzuki 4x4, looking for clues about what’s happened to Poopó, once Bolivia’s second largest lake, which has vanished into the thin air of the Andean highlands.We were driving on the lake bottom, yet we were more than 12,000 feet above sea level. The spring air was lip-chapping dry. Many of the fishing villages that have relied on Lake Poopó for thousands of years have emptied too, and we drove past clusters of abandoned adobe homes. Dust devils danced around them, spinning in warm winds. In the distance we spotted several small aluminum boats that seemed to be floating on water. As we drove closer, the mirage receded, and we found the boats sitting abandoned in the silt. I stepped out of the vehicle. My shoes cracked the salty crust that had formed jagged lumps, like ice cream in a freezer that has melted and recrystallized.My guide, Ramiro Pillco Zolá, crunched across the salt pan to reach one of the dilapidated, half-buried boats. Boyhood memories of paddling across the lake flooded back to him from long before he left his village of San Pedro de Condo to study hydrology and eventually earn a Ph.D. in hydrology and climate change at Lund University in Sweden. “We’re not talking about a small thing,” Pillco Zolá told me. “Three decades ago this lake covered 3,000 square kilometers. It’s going to be hard to recover.”Water that once spread across an expanse about the size of Rhode Island was gone. A pair of black rubber boots lay discarded near the boat. A fish skull bleached brilliant white flashed under the blinding sun. The wind suddenly stopped, cloaking the post-apocalyptic scene in silence. If water is life, this was the absence of both.Round the globe, climate change is warming many lakes faster than it’s warming the oceans and the air. This heat accelerates evaporation, conspiring with human mismanagement to intensify water shortages, pollution, and loss of habitat for birds and fish. But while “the fingerprints of climate change are everywhere, they don’t look the same in every lake,” says Catherine O’Reilly, an aquatic ecologist at Illinois State University and co-leader of a worldwide lake survey by 64 scientists.In eastern China’s Lake Tai, for example, farm runoff and sewage stimulate cyanobacterial blooms, and warm water encourages growth. The organisms threaten drinking-water supplies for two million people. East Africa’s Lake Tanganyika has warmed so much that fish catches that feed millions of poor people in four surrounding countries are at risk. The water behind Venezuela’s massive Guri hydroelectric dam has reached such critically low levels in recent years that the government has had to cancel classes for schoolchildren in an effort to ration electricity. Even the Panama Canal, with its locks recently widened and deepened to accommodate supersize cargo vessels, is troubled by El Niño–related rainfall shortages affecting man-made Gatun Lake, which supplies not only water to run the locks but also fresh drinking water for much of the country. Low water levels have also forced limits on the draft of ships so the ships don’t run aground in the lake.Of all the challenges lakes face in a warming world, the starkest examples are in closed drainage basins where waters flow into lakes but don’t exit into rivers or a sea. These terminal, or endorheic, lakes tend to be shallow, salty, and hypersensitive to disturbance. The vanishing act of the Aral Sea in Central Asia is a disastrous example of what can happen to such inland waters. In its case the main culprits were ambitious Soviet irrigation projects that diverted its nourishing rivers.Similar scenarios are playing out in terminal lakes on nearly every continent, a combination of overuse and worsening drought. Side-by-side satellite images reveal the shocking toll. Lake Chad in Africa has shrunk to a sliver of its former self since the 1960s, heightening shortages of fish and irrigation water. Displaced people and refugees who now depend on the lake put an additional strain on resources. Shortages as well as tensions in the hot, dry Sahel are driving conflict and mass migration. Utah’s Great Salt Lake and California’s Salton Sea and Mono Lake have undergone periods of recession too, diminishing critical breeding and nesting areas for birds as well as playgrounds for recreational boaters.After the Caspian Sea, Iran’s Lake Urmia was once the largest saltwater lake in the Middle East. But it has shrunk by some 80 percent over the past 30 years. The flamingos that feasted on brine shrimp are mostly gone. So are the pelicans, egrets, and ducks. What remain are piers that lead nowhere, the rusting carcasses of ships settled into the silt, and white, barren salt flats. Winds that whip across the lake bed blow salt dust to farm fields, slowly rendering the soil infertile. Noxious, salt-tinged dust storms inflame the eyes, skin, and lungs of people 60 miles away in Tabriz, a city of more than 1.5 million. And in recent years Urmia’s alluring turquoise waters have been stained blood-red from bacteria and algae that flourish and change color when salinity increases and sunlight penetrates the shallows. Many of the tourists who once flocked here for therapeutic baths are staying away.Although climate change has intensified droughts and elevated hot summer temperatures around Urmia, speeding up evaporation, that’s only part of the story. Urmia has thousands of illegal wells and a proliferation of dams and irrigation projects that divert water from tributary rivers to grow apples, wheat, and sunflowers. Experts worry that Urmia could fall victim to the same overexploitation of water as the Aral Sea. Their voices seem to have reached Tehran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has pledged five billion dollars to revive Urmia by releasing more water from dams, improving the efficiency of irrigation systems, and switching to less thirsty crops. And although United States–Iran relations have been strained for decades, the two countries have permitted scientists to brainstorm about ideas to replenish both Urmia and Great Salt Lake. Neither nation wants to see its salt lake go the way of Poopó.Bolivia's high plain, the Altiplano, unfurls like a leaf-shaped plateau wedged into an unusual place where South America’s Andes cleave into two separate ranges. The windswept landscape remains brown much of the year. Grasses and shrubs grow sturdy and low to the ground. The people who eke out a living in this inhospitable landscape are just as hardy. Toward the north end of the plateau sits Lake Titicaca, at 12,500 feet, straddling the border between Peru and Bolivia. At the southern end is blindingly white Salar de Uyuni, at 11,995 feet. Poopó rests between them, the transition zone between the world’s highest commercially navigable lake and the world’s largest salt flat.Scientists have long suspected that Poopó would someday be choked with sediment, desiccate, and transition into another salt flat like Salar de Uyuni. Yet its demise wasn’t projected to come for at least another thousand years, says Milton Pérez Lovera, a natural sciences professor at Oruro Technical University and a member of a team monitoring bodies of water in the Bolivian highlands. A combination of factors, including climate change, drought, upstream water diversions for agriculture, and mining, have accelerated the process, he says, leaving the lake increasingly dry and barren. Pérez Lovera expects Poopó may partly refill, perhaps as soon as this year, if La Niña conditions bring more rain to the Andes. But he and other scientists are less sure the lake will regain its ecological function as a prime wintering habitat for waterfowl, including three species of flamingos, one classified as vulnerable to extinction. Nor are they certain whether or when its fertile fishing grounds—which for millennia provided food for indigenous people—might recover.The fate of Lake Poopó is intertwined with that of the Urus, an indigenous group known as “people of the water.” The lake’s size and depth have been diminishing for years, forcing Uru fishermen to travel farther onto the lake to catch fish. In 2014 and 2015 the ever shallower lake suffered fish die-offs as water temperatures soared beyond the usual 60s and 70s Fahrenheit. Millions of carcasses floated belly-up at the surface. When Franz Ascui Zuna, assigned by Bolivia’s Ministry of Health to monitor the largest Uru village, Llapallapani, recorded a water temperature of 100.4°F, he pronounced a diagnosis: The lake was “running a fever.”Soon the ducks, herons, flamingos, and other birds that typically inhabit the lake were starving, either dying or flying away. In a flash of evaporation in 2015, the remaining lake vanished as its overheated waters were fanned by the Altiplano’s winds. The government declared Poopó a disaster area. It sent each family in surrounding villages some pasta, rice, cooking oil, and sugar. Then rains refilled a portion of the lake, prompting federal officials, in early 2017, to celebrate and release pictures taken from a helicopter. But soon after, Bolivian President Evo Morales toured the lake and confirmed what locals already knew: The shallow layer of water was receding fast. Satellite images in October 2017 showed the lake was once again nearly dry.Morales has sought to deflect any government culpability in the crisis, pointing to natural cycles of drying and recovery. His father once told him about bicycling across the lake bed from a nearby village where he grew up. Indeed, the lake has dried and recovered, most recently in the mid-1990s. Yet scientists point out that things have worsened since then. And now the watershed and the poor people who live here are teetering on something more tenuous.On the road into the village of Puñaca Tinta María, we watched an old man in rubber boots and a floppy straw hat stoop over, using a short-handled hoe to stir together clay with salty water he had hauled out of a hand-dug well. Every day since the lake dried up, Féliz Mauricio has toiled in mud-splattered clothes to make adobe bricks. “We have no lake,” he says. “We have no fish. We have nothing.” Mauricio, 77, comes from a long line of indigenous fishermen. A respected elder of the Urus, he’s known for his craftsmanship in lashing together reeds into small balsa fishing boats using giant bulrushes called totora and for preparing a table of offerings in traditional ceremonies to usher in bountiful rain and fishing seasons.By his reckoning, Mauricio, his wife, and their daughter are one of the few families left in adobe and thatch-roofed homes on the banks of what was once Lake Poopó. One son moved away to herd sheep and cattle; another took a low-skilled construction job in the city of Cochabamba. His neighbors in Puñaca Tinta María and other villages have scattered too, like chaff in the wind. Some have gone to work in textile and garment factories in Chile and Argentina; others have moved to cities and taken jobs as day laborers or work underground as miners extracting tin, lead, silver, and other metals. A few dozen have headed off to what may be the future of their beloved Poopó—working in the salt mines of Salar de Uyuni.In the global scheme of things, the fate of the Urus may seem trivial. An estimated 5,000 Urus remain today, and fewer than a thousand lived around Poopó before it went dry. Yet those who are forced to relocate join a procession of people around the world who have been uprooted from their homes by climate-related environmental disruptions. The United Nations warned a decade ago that indigenous people would be among the first to be ravaged by climate change because so many rely on nature’s bounty as subsistence hunters and fishermen. An estimated 23.5 million people fled their homes in 2016 because of storms, floods, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and other weather-related disasters, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. That exceeded the 6.9 million newly displaced by conflict and violence that year.In sheer numbers those fleeing “natural” calamities have outnumbered those fleeing war and conflict for decades. Still, these figures do not include people forced to abandon their homelands because of drought or gradual environmental degradation; almost two and a half billion people live in areas where human demand for water exceeds the supply. Globally the likelihood of being uprooted from one’s home has increased 60 percent compared with 40 years ago because of the combination of rapid climate change and growing populations moving into more vulnerable areas.Most of these displaced people stay within their home countries. If they cross a border, they do not qualify for UN protections as refugees because they cannot claim they are fleeing violence or persecution. “We live in an era of the most forced migration since the Second World War,” says William Lacy Swing, director general of the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration. “This time, though, in addition to war, climate is looming as a major driver. We are going to need to support those who are ravaged by climate change so they can migrate with dignity.”“Stop!” Pillco Zolá yelled inside our wind-buffeted SUV. “Go back.” We were racing across a flat, sandy expanse of highlands above Poopó. Without realizing it, we had crossed a small bridge over an irrigation canal. The canal was empty, as was the adjoining Desaguadero River, with the exception of a small pool we found as we walked around the bend. More than 65 percent of Poopó’s water comes from the Desaguadero River, which meanders 185 miles through the Bolivian highlands from its primary source, Lake Titicaca. Hundreds of irrigation canals and other water-diversion schemes have been built along the river for mining and for growing crops. Farms and cities also siphon water out of the Mauri River, a major tributary in Bolivia and Peru.Another 22 smaller, seasonal streams and rivers also flow into Poopó from surrounding mountains. Virtually all of them are tapped for agriculture or mining operations, such as a state-owned tin mine in the dirt-poor town of Huanuni. When I visited, a chute emerging from the hillside mill was plopping ash gray tailings directly into the river in a conical mound as big as a house. Such tailings contribute to the lead, cadmium, arsenic, and other heavy metals that pollute the lake and fill it with sediment.An hour’s drive away, a dam built in 1961 on the Tacahua River holds a thick layer of sediment with only a veneer of water. “We’ve got five dams like this one,” Pillco Zolá told me as we walked across the dry spillway, looking at the reservoir bed far below. “It doesn’t make sense to build dams in a semiarid area. We are just stopping water upstream, causing it to evaporate.”In an average year the Lake Poopó region collects about 15 inches of rain from November to March, followed by seven dry months. Yet the rainy season keeps shrinking, when it comes at all. The Altiplano has suffered repeated El Niño–related droughts, which scientists project will come more often in a warmer climate. The 2015-16 El Niño brought the most dramatic drought and the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the Bolivian highlands, Pérez Lovera says. The Altiplano tends to trap heat between the mountain ranges, he said, and mean temperatures increased 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit over a single decade, accelerating water loss due to evaporation.Rising atmospheric temperatures in the Andes over the past 40 years also have triggered the rapid retreat of its glaciers, melting half the ice that rings the Titicaca-Poopó basin.When glaciers first begin to melt, they provide an extra flush of water, explains Dirk Hoffmann, a German researcher based in La Paz who co-authored the book Bolivia in a 4-Degree Warmer World. “But we’ve probably reached peak water in most glacial watersheds,” he says, meaning that meltwater from glaciers will now diminish in the region until it is gone.Meanwhile, demand for water has surged along with Bolivia’s population, which has grown by 42 percent since the mid-1990s. Last year the government dug a canal in one branch of the sediment-laden Desaguadero River to speed water to Poopó. It also provided wheelbarrows, pickaxes, and some food to support desperate Uru workers as they built a one-and-a-half-foot-high earthen berm on the lake bed in hopes of concentrating water in one small section so it might last longer. To hydrologists like Pillco Zolá, such efforts seem all but futile. More realistic solutions would mean tearing down dams, switching to more efficient irrigation, and reducing the volumes of water diverted from the rivers. Yet there’s little political will to cut off upstream farmers and even less funding for water projects in Bolivia, one of the poorest nations in Latin America.A Peruvian-Bolivian commission that co-governs Titicaca has built floodgates designed to release more water into the Desaguadero River during dry years. But as demand for water increases upstream in Peru, these floodgates may be rendered useless in the not too distant future. Mark Bush, a paleoecologist at the Florida Institute of Technology, notes that it doesn’t take much of a drop in the water level at Lake Titicaca for the river to stop flowing altogether. That has happened three times before, tucked in the deep recesses of time.“The Altiplano is exquisitely sensitive to evaporation,” Bush says. Although he cautions that climate models don’t capture the Andes particularly well, he predicts that the region soon may reach a tipping point. “The prognosis for cities like La Paz and villages around Lake Poopó is really dire, given what we think is going to happen in the future,” Bush says. “By mid-century we might see at least two degrees [Fahrenheit] of warming, and we would be flirting with the threshold that would cause Lake Titicaca to evaporate away or greatly reduce its volume.”South of Poopó, in the highlands, the lakeshore gives way to an even more arid landscape, with wind-sculpted rocks and herds of llamas, alpacas, sheep, and a few wild vicuñas—often clustered near no-hunting signs posted on the highway. In early spring much of the land remains bare, with soil left exposed after the harvest of quinoa that feeds an insatiable appetite for the high-protein grain in Europe and the U.S.The timing is unfortunate. Before the year’s crops are planted, the winds off the Atacama Desert in Chile scour the empty fields, carrying twice as many tons of sediment into the lake as they did before native grasses and shrubs were cleared for quinoa production. The result: The lake, which used to be 12 feet deep, is filling with sand and dust faster than had been projected.Beyond the highlands the surface of Salar de Uyuni—crusted with polygons the size of card tables—is broken only by roads and mounds of salt chipped out of the ground to be shipped to nearby salt factories.Is this the future of Poopó? Paulino Flores, a former Uru community leader, hopes not—but he’s preparing, just in case. Flores, 57, and his family moved to the neighboring town of Colchani to work in the salt factories. Flores says he has mastered every aspect of production: chipping the salt out of the hard ground with a pickax and shovel, hauling it to the factory, removing impurities, grinding it, bagging it. He rubs his callused, salt-stained hands as he talks, squinting into the sun under his knitted Andean chullo hat.Flores has considered establishing a salt factory on the shores of Poopó, working with the nongovernmental group Center of Ecology and the Andean People. The group’s executive director, Gilberto Pauwels, says his colleagues are exploring every angle to help the Urus develop other livelihoods, preserve their communities, and keep their culture alive. Puñaca Tinta María is just one of the half-deserted villages on one desiccated lake that has left subsistence fishermen and hunters scrambling to figure out how to feed their families. It’s a pattern that’s being repeated around the world.Flores dreams about the lake’s recovery, the return of its fish and fowl. He talks wistfully about his former life, growing up hunting and fishing with his father and relatives—a life that revolved around Lake Poopó. The Urus believe they are descendants of people who first settled on the Altiplano 3,700 years ago. A 2013 genetic study suggests they may be right, revealing distinctive ancestry likely derived from ancient Andean lineages. These self-reliant people, who once lived on floating reed islands, outlasted the Inca Empire and survived the brutal conquest by the Spaniards. But now the Urus around Poopó face a diaspora with the disappearance of their cherished lake. “If there is no lake, there is no Uru people,” Flores says. “It gives us food and gives us a future.”",
"The sun rises over an oil field in California.In less than 20 years, millions of people in the United States could be exposed to dangerous “off-the-charts” heat conditions of 127 degrees Fahrenheit or more, a startling new report has found. In 60 years over one-third of the population could be exposed to such conditions, “posing unprecedented health risks,” the report says.This first United States county-by-county look at what climate change will do to temperature and humidity conditions in the coming decades finds few places that won’t be affected by extreme heat.“We were very surprised at how steeply and quickly the number of days of dangerous heat increased in such a short time,” says Kristina Dahl, senior climate scientist at Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), and co-author of the report “Killer Heat in the United States: Climate Choices and the Future of Dangerously Hot Days.”“I don’t think anyone appreciated how quickly conditions can change,” says Dahl.Without any action to reduce global carbon emissions, parts of Florida and Texas would experience the equivalent in days of at least five months per year on average when the heat index—which includes humidity in its calculations—exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of those days will surpass 105 degrees before the end of the century.The National Weather Service’s (NWS)'s heat index goes up to 127 degrees Fahrenheit. But in as soon as 20 years the Southeast, Southern Great Plains, and Midwest will begin to experience days that are so hot they are “off the charts.” A few decades later extreme heat will affect communities in 47 states, said the report, which is also published today as a peer-reviewed study in Environmental Research Communications.By mid-century (between the years 2036 and 2065), more than 250 U.S. cities will experience the equivalent of a month or more per year on average with a heat index surpassing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to just 29 cities historically. That is a conservative estimate for cities because heat added by urban heat island effects isn’t represented in the report, said Dahl.The increase in the prevalence of heat events by mid-century in this study “represents a terrifying prospect….[and] a direct and immediate threat to human health and wellbeing,” said Tom Crowther, a climate researcher at ETH Zürich, in an email. Crowther is the co-author of a recent study that looked at the future climates of the world’s biggest 520 cities and found that some, including 17 U.S. cities, will experience unprecedented climates by 2050.The study averaged together projections from 18 hyper-local climate models between April and October over 30-year periods: a historical baseline (1971–2000), midcentury (2036–2065), and late century (2070–2099). The study showed generally that the Southeast and Southern Great Plains would bear the brunt of the extreme heat, experiencing heat that currently only occurs in the Sonoran Desert, in the SouthwestAreas in those regions would experience the equivalent of three months per year on average by mid-century that feel hotter than 105 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly as hot as 115 degrees, 125 degrees, or worse.This interactive mapping tool developed for the study shows the rapid, widespread increases in extreme heat projected to occur across the United States due to climate change. Information is presented by county and includes all 3,109 counties in the contiguous U.S.The NWS heat-index scale is a metric that combines temperature and humidity and is often called the “feels like” temperature. If that reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), our bodies begin to slowly heat up to the ambient temperature. The human body’s internal temperature likes to be between 98.6 to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 38 degrees Celsius); any warmer, and it’s a fever. If our internal temperature reaches 104 degrees, all-important cellular machinery starts to break down. This is extremely dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.“We have little to no experience with ‘off-the-charts’ heat in the U.S.,” said Erika Spanger-Siegfried, lead climate analyst at UCS and report co-author. “Exposure to conditions in that range makes it difficult for human bodies to cool themselves and could be deadly,” Spanger-Siegfried said in a press release.While the upper Midwest, Northeast, and Northwest are unlikely to experience off-the-charts heat, it will still be hotter, and people and infrastructure have little ability to cope with plus-100 degree Fahrenheit heat over multiple days, said Rachel Licker, senior climate scientist at UCS and report co-author. “The rise in days with extreme heat will change life as we know it nationwide,” Licker said in a press release.Type your county into this tool to find out how hot it will be near you.Much of this extreme heat is still avoidable with steep, rapid carbon emission reductions. If future warming is kept at 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) or less, the number of days where the heat index is above 105 degrees nationwide would be slashed in half. That means about 125 million fewer people would be exposed to a month or more of such conditions, compared with our current emissions growth, the report said.However, the U.S. will still be significantly warmer than today with 85 urban areas—18 percent of those analyzed— exposed to 30 or more days with a heat index above 105 degrees, compared with just three urban areas historically. That said, if current pledges to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement are met, global temperatures will still rise by at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The Trump administration said in June 2017 that it would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement.“The scale of heat impacts in this study hint at the enormous changes that climate change will mean for the U.S.,” says Richard Rood, a meteorologist and climate impacts expert at the University of Michigan.Extreme heat will not occur in isolation. There will also be droughts, wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather events that will compound the impacts of the heat, Rood said in an interview. Food production will be compromised. Add in sea level rise and there will be significant internal migration.“People are going to move, not only within the U.S. but elsewhere in the world,” he says.While it is vital to reduce emissions as quickly as possible, adaptation to the coming heat and extreme events is crucial.“Our past climate can no longer guide us. We have to build and adapt to what’s coming,” says Rood.",
"Thermometer-wielding volunteer drivers are partnering with climate researchers to create maps of urban heat islands across the United States. On a hot day in Washington, D.C., for example, temperatures varied nearly 17 degrees F between the warmest spot and the coolest. To cope with the heat, many cities are planting trees and carving out open spaces. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which funded the research, plans to expand it to help cities figure out ways to keep their cool in a warming world.",
"In Rocky Mountain National Park, 415 square miles of mountain terrain are protected—but not from effects of climate change. The average annual temperature in the high-elevation park increased 3.4˚F in the 20th century. That has worsened a trifecta of troubles—bark beetles, wildfires, and invasive plants such as cheatgrass—doing visible harm to the plant life covering three-fourths of the park.",
"Washington’s Mount Rainier boasts the largest collection of glaciers on a single peak in the contiguous United States. But those glaciers have lost approximately 18 percent of their volume since 1970. The most substantial thinning is occurring on south-facing glaciers and at elevations below 6,562 feet (2,000 meters). During extreme weather this could set the stage for massive floods and debris flows in the park and surrounding areas.",

"Florida’s famed wetlands, the Everglades, are pinched between a burgeoning Miami to the east and encroaching saltwater to the west. With sea levels rising, the immense freshwater marsh hangs in the balance. By 2100 most of this unique national treasure could be dramatically altered.",
"An egret takes flight in Everglades National Park.Spanning 1.5 million acres of freshwater and coastal prairie, marsh, mangroves, pine and cypress woods, and the waters and islands of Florida Bay, Everglades National Park contains the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States. For first-time visitors, the park’s size and relatively inaccessible terrain can make it difficult to figure out where and how to experience the Everglades in a meaningful way. This main entrance, located on the eastern edge of the park in Homestead, is a convenient option for a half- or full-day visit or for planning a backcountry trip. Stop at the Ernest Coe Visitor Center (open 365 days a year) to watch the orientation films, pick up maps and brochures, and participate in ranger-led programs. From here, it’s only a four-mile drive west to the Royal Palm area’s two accessible trails—the Anhinga (0.8-mile loop) and the Gumbo Limbo (0.4-mile loop). Alligators, turtles, herons, egrets, and, yes, anhingas, are regularly spotted when walking the first trail, one of the most popular in the park. On the less traveled Gumbo Limbo, you’re more likely to see songbirds and butterflies. Inside Tip: Arrive prepared to go slough slogging, off-trail hiking through the shallow, freshwater slough—the Everglades' iconic “river of grass.” Standard slough-slogger gear includes mosquito repellent; water; sturdy, waterproof hiking boots or trail-running shoes; and clothes you don’t mind getting muddy and wet.When to Go: December through March is the best time to visit due to the cooler temperatures, dry weather, increased ranger programs, and abundant wildlife-viewing opportunities (particularly along the Anhinga Trail).Must Dos: Walk the Anhinga Trail. Take a scenic 38-mile (one-way) drive along the main park road from the Ernest Coe Visitor Center to the Flamingo Visitor Center on Florida Bay. Stop at the Long Pine Key picnic area (six miles from the main entrance) to park, picnic, and hike or bike part of the 43-mile pinelands trail network. Just before reaching Flamingo, pull off to hike the Snake Bight Trail. The 1.6-mile (one-way) trail leads to a viewing platform overlooking a bight (small bay) on Florida Bay. Best Bet: December to April, join a ranger-led tour of the Nike Missile Base, an abandoned antiaircraft missile site built in response to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Fun Fact: The 1960s CBS television series Gentle Ben, starring Dennis Weaver as Everglades game warden Tom Wedloe, included many scenes filmed on location in the national park. The series’ namesake was the pet black bear of Wedloe’s young son (played by director Ron Howard’s brother Clint). While the short-lived (1967-69) series was lauded for promoting conservation, it also received criticism for portraying a wild, adult bear as a tame, lovable, and approachable animal.The Everglades’ Flamingo Visitor Center is located on Florida Bay, 38 miles south of the Ernest Coe Visitor Center. From late November through April, this section of the park buzzes with water-based tours and rentals (boat, kayak, and canoe) and wildlife. Look for alligators, American crocodiles, and the occasional manatee in the Florida Marina boat basins. Outside the visitors center, watch wading birds gather on the exposed mudflats at low tide. To maximize the wildlife views, paddle one of the canoe trails leading inland from Flamingo or (if you’re an experienced paddler) out into Florida Bay. Get maps and ranger advice (mid-November to mid-April) in the visitors center. Rent canoes at the marina. And apply plenty of mosquito repellent and sunscreen. Inside Tip: Free guided canoe trips are typically offered from December to March and fill up fast. Call the park to make reservations and to get the most current schedule of programs available. For unguided trips, the Nine Mile Pond shortcut route (a 3.5-mile loop) is a smart choice for beginners.Visitors approach the 65-foot Shark Valley observation tower in Everglades National Park.Photograph by Wim Wiskerke, AlamyShark Valley, located off U.S. 41 (Tamiami Trail) near Miami, is the best area in Everglades National Park for scenic bike rides (rentals available). The most popular attraction here is the naturalist-led tram tour. Pedaling instead of riding the flat, 15-mile Tram Road loop provides a more intimate view of the Shark River Slough, the freshwater heart of the Everglades. Plus, when you bike you can go at your own pace and spend extra time perched above the park on the 65-foot observation tower (located at the southern end of the loop). Inside Tip: Dry season (generally December to May) is the best time for wildlife viewing. Since Shark Valley is a freshwater source year-round, alligators, turtles, waterfowl, and other animals congregate here when water is scarce in other parts of the park.A fan boat ferries passengers on a waterway in Everglades City.Photograph by Bill Bachmann, AlamyThe Gulf Coast Visitor Center is located on the northwestern edge of the park in Everglades City. This is the starting point for the 99-mile Wilderness Waterway Trail to Flamingo (experienced paddlers only). Also accessible from Gulf Coast are shorter, scenic canoe trails where you can paddle creeks and shallow coastal estuaries to look for fish, alligators, wading birds, and other wildlife. Boat, kayak, and canoe rentals and boat tours are available. Inside Tip: Since tides, weather, wind, and passing powerboats can make any paddling trip challenging, talk with the rangers and review the park’s Wilderness Trip Planner before heading out.",

"The downtown Houston skyline and flooded highway 288 on August 27, 2017, as the city battles with rising waters from Hurricane Harvey.Climate forecast for 2050: New York City winters will have the weather of today’s Virginia Beach, damp and cold London will be hot and dry like Barcelona, wet Seattle will be like drier San Francisco, and Washington D.C. will be more like today’s Nashville but with even greater variation in temperatures and precipitation. Those predictions are according to the first global analysis of how some cities’ climate conditions will shift under climate change.“We wanted to know what’s the most conservative estimate of what the climate will be for 520 major cities in 2050,” said Tom Crowther, a researcher at ETH Zürich, and senior author of the study published today in the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE.“The changes we found are huge,” Crowther says in an interview.To illustrate their findings the Crowther Lab in Switzerland created a global data map that pairs one city’s future climate conditions with current ones. For example Minneapolis in 2050 will be more like Kansas City, with Minneapolis’s warmest month shooting up from around 80 degrees Fahrenheit on average to more than 90F in 2050.Generally speaking, cities in the Northern Hemisphere will have the climates cities more than 620 miles to their south have today, he said.In Europe, summers and winters will get considerably warmer by 2050, with average increases of 3.5°C and 4.7°C, respectively, compared with 2000.There are no good pairings or analogues for more than 22 percent of the world’s major cities—those with one million or more people currently, researchers found. Those 115 cities, including Washington and 16 other U.S. cities, will have unprecedented climate conditions by 2050 compared to what they saw in 2000, the baseline for the study.That doesn’t mean that Washington will be hotter than Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, today. It means that there is no current match for the wide climate variations in temperatures, seasonality, and precipitation the city will experience, said Crowther.The vast majority of the 115 cities that will experience “novel” climates are in the tropics and include metropolises like Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Rangoon, and Singapore. Changes in tropical cities will be less in terms of temperature increases, but will be dominated by more frequent extreme precipitation events and the severity and intensity of droughts.“The fate of major tropical cities remains uncertain as many will experience unprecedented climate conditions,” the study concludes.The study uses state-of-the-art climate model projections of existing data, but analyzed in ways that will be more meaningful to the public and city planners. Knowing that London’s climate will be like Barcelona’s—which has experienced severe droughts requiring $25 million to import drinking water in 2008—can help planners prepare for what’s coming.“We want to help people visualize the impact of climate change in their own city, within their lifetime,” says lead author Jean-Francois Bastin, a researcher at ETH Zürich.Atlanta | Baltimore | Boston | Charlotte | Cincinnati | Columbus | Indianapolis | Las Vegas | Louisville | Memphis | Monrovia | Nashville | Phoenix | Pittsburgh | Salt Lake City | St. Louis | Washington, D.C. |See the climate forecasts for these cities here.The shift of warmer temperatures northward of 12 miles a year seems reasonable, as do the findings, said Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University. Still, the conclusions are “sobering” Mann said in an email. Also sobering is the likelihood that more than two-thirds of the world’s population will be living in urban areas by 2050.The carbon emission trajectory used in the study is the very conservative 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius stabilization projected by 2050. Actual carbon emissions are much higher and more on a 3 to 4 degree Celsius trajectory. However, the temperature increases on both trajectories are very similar up until 2050, when the current high-emission forecast diverges substantially, said Mann.Regions like the Middle East will only get hotter and drier, with major consequences for food production and the ability of the cities there to provide enough water and cooling, said Crowther. For most cities the implications of the study are pretty “horrible,” he says.",
"Today, Washington, D.C.'s summers are hot and humid. In August 2018, a severe heat wave swept the city. This man braved the swelter to sit on the National Mall. By the 2080s, those summers will get even steamier–and will likely feel a lot like summers in the deep southeastern U.S. feel today.Want a glimpse of Washington, D.C.'s climate future? Take a road trip down to Greenwood, Mississippi. In just a few decades, as climate change heats up the planet, that same swelter is likely to be de rigueur in D.C. Meanwhile, down in Mississippi, seasons will morph into something like those in northern Mexico today.  Climate change is ushering in a new era for cities across North America. But how the future will look and feel doesn’t have to be a complete mystery: New research published Tuesday in Nature Communications shows that by the 2080s, the climate in cities across the country will look and feel like places a few hundred miles south of them today.So winters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will soften so they resemble the season as it currently exists in Lansing, Kansas. Spring in Wasilla, Alaska, may come as early as Marinette, Wisconsin’s does today.Warmer winters may sound nice, says Matt Fitzpatrick, an ecologist at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the lead author of the study. But they come with a huge cost: It’s not just temperature and snow or rain that will change as climate shifts, but the whole ecological world.“The direct effects of climate change are bad enough, but natural systems are tightly linked with climate,” he says. “If these changes come rapidly, those systems are going to get out of whack—so this has potentially massive implications for forests, water supplies, farming—all kinds of things,” he says.Over beers one afternoon at a bar in Tennessee, Fitzpatrick and a colleague decided to try to map out North America’s future. They built a tool that outlined what a “normal” year looks like in 540 cities across the continent, temperature- and precipitation-wise. Then they looked at what models predicted those same cities would be like during each season 60 years in the future (you can find your own city using their interactive tool).They looked at two different scenarios. First, they considered a future where humans take hold of carbon emissions and reduce them aggressively within the next few decades—RCP 4.5, in climate policy parlance. RCP stands for "Representative Concentration Pathway" and describes how greenhouse gas emissions will proceed in the future. The 4.5 scenario is considered an intermediate pathway—not the best-case scenario (known as RCP 2.6), in which emissions drop off quickly within the next few years, but not the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5), where greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.Then, they looked at that “worst-case” scenario. (Fitzpatrick points out, though, that recent estimates show that the planet is essentially tracking along this path now—meaning the “worst case” could, in fact, be even worse).The patterns for how cities would change was similar between the two scenarios. Most places in the Northeast would get warmer and wetter, settling into a steamy humid state now commonly associated with the Southeast. In the western U.S., cities will generally get hotter and drier.(Read about how heat waves are getting more intense—and deadly).The difference was how much. In the better-case scenario of climate change—where emissions start slowing down soon—cities will look, on average, like ones 300 miles away from them today. But in the worst-case scenario, that distance jumps to over 500 miles.“What we found really showed me that reducing emissions can have a big impact on how things develop,” says Fitzpatrick. Only recently, he and his young daughter had hiked through the snowy mountains near his hometown in Tennessee with his young daughter. In the worst-case scenarios, it’s far from certain that she’d be able to feel the same cold flakes on her cheeks by the time she’s in her 60s.Last fall, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report warning that even warming the planet up by, on average, 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) could induce devastating effects by as soon as 2040.When “we’re talking about one degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees—it looks very small compared to the difference between summer and winter,” says Stéphane Hallegate, a climate expert at the World Bank who was not involved in the study. That makes it tricky to understand how big a deal that much warming would be for Earth.But just a few degrees of difference can have huge impacts. About 20,000 years ago during the height of the last ice age, when ice sheets nosed down as far south as New York City, air temperatures were only between about two to 10 degrees Celsius cooler across the planet than they are today—and the world as we know it was completely reshaped.“So what these maps aren’t showing is a lot more concerning than what they do show,” says Jennifer Marlon, a scientist and science communication expert at Yale who was not involved in the study.“We're not just talking about changing the temperature of a city, or its precipitation: We're talking about so much more,” she says. “We’re talking about shifting the entire climate of latitudinal bands and also about changing the variability of the weather in those places. Minneapolis-Saint Paul is going to feel like Kansas City, sure—like Kansas City but with less food, less water, a damaged grid, and all of these other systemic problems we're walking into if we don’t address climate change.”",
"Cities around the world, like New York, can be part of the solution to the climate crisis. A new report suggests that part of the solution is for city dwellers to consume less.Cities can play a major role in the global effort to curb climate change, a new report says—and a major step they can take is helping their inhabitants consume a whole lot less stuff by making changes in the way cities are run.Even the most forward-thinking cities have a long way to go to neutralize their carbon emissions, the report says. That’s partly because for years, cities have been doing carbon math wrong, adding up only the carbon costs that occur within city limits. But much of city dwellers' climate impact actually comes from the things they eat, use, or buy that originate far outside the city—from food to clothes to electronics and more.To keep emissions in check, the report suggests, cities should aim to trim their carbon emissions by 50 percent in the next 11 years, and then by a total of 80 percent by 2050. And because, as the researchers found, a hefty portion of those emissions can be traced back to consumer goods, food, and energy produced outside city limits, one of the best things cities can do is help their residents pull back on consumption.That’s a big challenge but also a big opportunity, says Mark Watts, the lead author of the report and executive director of the C40 city network, an international network of cities committed to addressing climate issues.“Halving emissions in the next 10 years--that’s what needs to happen, and cities see that,” he says. “Now, it’s time to move onto the next stage, because we’re already in a climate emergency, and figure out how does government have to change in order to hit that target?”Today, some 55 percent of all humans live in urban areas, where they account for about 70 percent of all annual carbon emissions. In the future, demographers predict, even more of Earth’s population will likely congregate in cities, hitting about 70 percent by 2050. If nothing changes, carbon emissions from cities is on track to almost double by 2050, the report says. And as cities’ carbon emissions go up, so do the planet’s.For years, many cities sold themselves as bastions of efficient, low-carbon living. To some extent, that’s true. Densely packed neighborhoods, good public transit systems, and green buildings all help to keep their inhabitants’ carbon impacts in check. (Read about what sustainable cities of the future might look like).But city dwellers—especially those in wealthy cities in developed countries—tend to buy more, fly more, and use a lot more energy than people who live in rural areas. All the things they buy—from the clothes to the food to the electronics and more—have their own complicated and often substantial planetary costs that aren’t always immediately obvious.A t-shirt, for example, might get made of cotton grown in India; be manufactured in China using coal energy to power the sewing machines; packed up in yet another country with oil-based plastic packaging; shipped across oceans in fossil-fuel-fired container ships; and delivered by diesel truck to the store in which they’re sold.A real assessment of someone’s carbon footprint takes the carbon footprint of these “consumed” products into account. And when city dwellers’ consumption habits are added up, it turns out that urbanites have a carbon toll about 60 percent higher than previous calculations suggested. City dwellers in 96 of the world’s biggest cities alone make up a hefty 10 percent of all global carbon emissions each year.“People tend to forget that most of the products we consume and our personal carbon footprints are imported from elsewhere to give us a great life in the modern cities we live in,” says Jeroen van der Heijden, an expert on climate and government at Victoria University in New Zealand.“If we truly want to make a meaningful contribution to cutting carbon emissions, we must do much better than building green houses. We have to rethink how we live and what we consume.”National governments and international communities have struggled to take meaningful steps toward addressing carbon emissions. In many cases, cities have stepped in to fill that role, developing ambitious climate action plans that seek to curb emissions.The C40 network cities have collectively pledged to limit their carbon emissions to levels that will help keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the upper limit of warming the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently warned against exceeding.To get there, the report suggests cities can nudge behaviors in six key areas: food, construction and building, clothing, vehicles and transportation, aviation, and consumer electronics from washing machines to computers to phones.For example, cities are often already major food purchasers; they buy for schools, city organizations, and more. That means that they can influence emissions by changing their buying practices.New York schools are starting a “Meatless Mondays” program in 2019 that the city says will reduce its citizens' carbon footprint and make kids healthier. Other cities, like Milan, have put programs in place to help local agriculture thrive, reducing the carbon costs from transporting foods long distances.It turns out that city dwellers also buy a lot of clothes, and the carbon impact of those jeans and sweaters piles up. If people bought only eight new clothing items each year, the report says, they could cut that impact in half.Cities can also take action to reduce the amount of energy their denizens use by doing things like tweaking building codes to encourage retrofits of buildings rather than new construction; prioritizing low-carbon transportation options that keep people from buying new cars or motorbikes; and setting up programs that help people extend the lifetime of their electronics and appliances rather than constantly replacing them. Every intervention that helps people buy less new stuff adds up, pushing a city's emissions down.The transformations have to happen in a way that cuts from the individual consumer all the way up to the big players like the utilities who serve a city, says Patricia Romero-Lankao, an expert on cities and the environment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.“Yes indeed we need to change the way we use energy, heat houses, think of our sense of comfort—which is a cultural thing—buy clothes, all that,” she says. “But we really also need to work with the utilities, the corporations, the big players whose products we’re using.”But the biggest transformation is about a mindset, says Watts, of C40. “We’re talking about a really radical change in consumption patterns,” he says, moving toward a world where there is much less buying, less building, and less waste. “But the benefits really are huge. Avoiding the climate crisis really does mean building a much better life.”",
"People play volleyball in Eleanor Tinsley Park in Buffalo Bayou, a 160-acre park in Houston, Texas.City parks have long been a place for urban residents surrounded by the gray of asphalt and concrete to get a small dose of green. As cities increasingly feel the impacts of rising seas and temperatures, city planners are rethinking the roles of urban parks.“There’s been a quiet and profound move to use parks to help cities adapt to the realities of climate change,” says Diane Regas, CEO of The Trust for Public Land, an organization that works to create neighborhood and national parks.Each year the trust publishes their ParkScore Index, which ranks the top 100 largest U.S. cities by parks. The 2019 rankings will be released on Wednesday; Minneapolis won the highest ranking in 2018. The trust looks at size, convenience, amenities, and financial investment to compile its list.While amenities like basketball hoops and playgrounds have long been assets that bumped cities into top spots, increasingly, Regas says, the trust is seeing cities build parks that can alleviate climate change effects like intense heat, flooding, and poor air quality.And it's more than shade trees that are helping fight climate change. The trust says parks can help mitigate coastal flooding, capture carbon, and foster a sense of community among those that will be affected by extreme weather.All of the dark-gray asphalt in cities collect heat—a lot of it. A 2018 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration mapped the hottest areas of Washington, D.C. and found that intense heat nearly always aligned with the densest urban areas. Large parks cooled certain parts of the city by as much as 17 degrees Fahrenheit. That kind of cooling can be a lifesaver given the more than 600 annual deaths caused by heat-related illnesses.Dallas is one of the country's fastest-warming cities thanks in part to its sprawling, impervious surfaces, but with a new $312 million bond package, the city is hoping to change that.“A lot of people see Texas as very conservative but there's no denying that climate change is real, and our cities understand that,” says Dallas Park and Recreation President Robert Abtahi. “Our parks are taking on that big challenge in the ways we can the best.”Using satellite data, the city is able to see what neighborhoods most need the cooling effect of green spaces. Parks like the planned Dallas Water Gardens will be situated in some of the most heat-stressed parts of the city.Cities are increasingly being inundated with floodwaters, and city planners think parks can help with this issue too.A report published in February by The Nature Conservancy looked at the best ways to mitigate flooding in Houston, a city with many neighborhoods built on floodplains and regularly inundated by rising waters. Offering affected homeowners buyouts and converting homes into green spaces would save more money than installing infrastructure like pipes, they found.The coastal city has projects under way to create more than 150 miles of trails, parks, and green spaces along the many bayous running through its urban landscape.While Houston received a wakeup call from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, it was Hurricane Sandy's 2012 strike along the Northeast coast that forced cities to reconcile their new realities.New York City is building a patchwork of waterfront parks designed to absorb the energy of incoming water and to drain deluges of rainwater. Atlanta, after repeatedly being hit by flash floods, is creating a 16-acre park designed to absorb millions of gallons of water.In Boston, Parks and Recreation Commissioner Christopher Cook says the city is preparing to see 40 inches of sea level rise by 2050.“Parks are playing an outsized role in the adaptation plan,” he says, but emphasizes that the city doesn't see urban parks as a solution to stop or reverse climate change. For that, he touts instead Boston's plan to become carbon neutral over the next 30 years.Brendan Shane, the climate program director at the Trust for Public Land, says parks can ultimately provide a sort of social resilience, in addition to cooling neighborhoods and absorbing floodwater.“The stronger the bonds are from neighbor to neighbor, the better they are able to react to a shock,” he says. “The nice thing about parks is they give you all those things at the same time.”While drainage pipes and reservoirs have also been used to curb some of the impacts of rising seas, the trust and city planners see parks as a way to adapt while providing a better quality of life. It's not only about making green space, they say, but also about creating opportunities for people to exercise and play.“Not a single sollution by itself will avoid the climate crisis. We see parks as an important part of it, but there isn't a silver bullet,” says Regas.She adds: “Parks are an example of what we in the environmental [advocacy] community need to do to embrace solutions that simultaneously address climate change and make people’s lives better.”",
"A charred swath of boreal forest can be seen along highway 63 near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, in May 2016, after a devastating wildfire.Imagine a black hole in the center of a green donut, Malcolm North said.A USDA forest ecologist in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California, North was at the center of a new experiment in forestry with global implications. In September 2014, the King Fire ripped through 150 square miles (390 square kilometer) of the Eldorado National Forest. North was part of a team of scientists studying new ways to bring the forest back.That put him at the center of one of the hottest new fields of climate adaptation—and a quiet revolution in his own field. Throughout the 20th Century, the Forest Service grew trees by, well, planting them. “We’d go out to a big fire or clear cut,” North said, of his college summers working as a tree planter, “and every ten to twelve feet we’d plant another pine tree. At the end it would look just like a corn crop.”They called it “pines in lines,” and over the last century it became industry standard as the Forest Service replanted the native mixed-species forests of Western conifers with trees for commercial harvest.But that method—relying not only on armies of sowers but also foresters who come back, years later, to “clean up the mess”—has become prohibitively expensive for a Forest Service facing the intersection of a more volatile climate with flat funding.“Forest Service spending on fire suppression has gone from 15 percent of the budget to 55 percent,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in 2017. “That means we have to keep borrowing from funds that are intended for forest management.”So the hunt is on for ways that tomorrow’s forests can better care for themselves. In January, North was part of a team of 25 University of California and Forest Service ecologists and siliviculturalists arguing for a new model of forestry that would replace the old straight-line monocultures with new methods emphasizing variety of both spacing and species. Evidence in support of this new model comes not just from California but from China, the Amazon, Europe, and elsewhere. It’s a more natural way of doing forestry, and one that also puts these experts on the front lines of a pivotal struggle to slow climate change.The Eldorado is one case study in what the World Resources Institute (WRI) calls “degraded lands:” part of an estimated 2 billion hectares—a land area about the size of Australia, as shown on this interactive map—ready for restoration.Restoration is a term-of-art that, after nearly two centuries of industrial deforestation, often means new forests. Trees are about a quarter carbon, and as they grow (or burn) they bind (or release) about four times their weight in carbon dioxide. For all the hype around carbon-capturing machines, says Mary Booth, an ecologist at the Massachusetts-based Partnership for Policy Integrity, when it comes to drawing down carbon, “forests are the only proven, scalable technology we have.”Yet at the heart of North and company’s work is a disquieting fact: the wrong reforestation policies can be worse than no reforestation at all.“The consequences of getting it wrong can be really destructive,” he said. The example of Eldorado raises real cautions about the value of a top-down approach and suggests that the path to a healthier global forest may be preparing the ground, acknowledging our limitations—and then getting out of the way.For the last decade, the once-denuded slopes of Pakistan’s Hindu Kush, once the haunt of timber smugglers and illegal loggers, have been refilling with trees. Last April, Pakistan announced the completion of its “Billion Tree Tsunami,” which converted 350,000 hectares of degraded and deforested land—about the size of Taiwan—into “restoration areas” where land and forest could recover.The country’s environmentalists are now pushing for ten billion trees, but Pakistan is already the first to meet its commitments under the Bonn Challenge, under which dozens of countries committed to halt the loss of their natural forest and begin restoring degraded cropland and forest.Bonn signatories are halfway to their pledge goal of 350 million hectares of forests and croplands—an area larger than India—by 2030; if those areas are regrown, the organization estimates, it could harbor 15 gigatons of CO2, about half the current annual fuel emissions.Far more sequestration is possible. The Nature Conservancy estimates that “natural climate solutions,” like restoring degraded soils, safeguarding wetlands, and planting new forests, could account for almost 40 percent of the carbon savings needed to keep the world on the 2-degree Celsius path generally seen as necessary to keep climate chaos to survivable levels.Large swaths of the globe are already greening. India, which has begun restoring almost ten million hectares—37,000 square miles, is, along with China, part of what a recent Nature Sustainability paper called a “strikingly prominent” pattern of greening. In both of those countries, new land-use practices, bolstered by rising levels of atmospheric CO2, have brought huge increases in the area covered by vegetation.China alone has accounted for 25 percent of the global increase in vegetation area since 2000, about half of which is from increase in forests. (In India, it’s almost entirely an increase in croplands.)In a sense, this is par for a global course: part of “The Forest Transition,” an epochal shift as trees return to long-cleared lands. In Spain, trees recolonize abandoned farmland. In Latin America and the Caribbean, long watchwords for deforestation, a sweeping Global Environmental Change study found that “reforestation hotspots,” areas of expanding forests, covered about ten percent of the continent, including areas all but given up for lost, like Brazil’s Atlantic Rainforest. Between 2000 and 2014, Latin America added about 64,000 square miles (167,000 square kilometers) in forests, about the size of Syria.But while more forests sound a like a good thing, the example of North America suggests that reforestation can be a two-edged sword, undoing exactly the problem it is set up to solve.In April 2016, an enormous wildfire nearly wiped out the Canadian oil town of Fort McMurray, destroying 2,400 houses and forcing almost a hundred thousand people from their homes.It was the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history, and after the embers had cooled—along with the familiar arguments around the role of climate change—a team of Canadian eco-hydrologists went into the burnt-out forest to solve a mystery. The Fort McMurray wildfires had begun in peat swamps along the Horse River, a wet forest where native trees sported scarves of water-dense, flame-retarding peat moss.True, climate and weather conditions had been unusually ripe for a fire—but how had a swamp burned with such severity? The team’s disquieting conclusion: the cause of the blaze, and the massive amounts of carbon dioxide it had released into the air, lay in a botched campaign of government-driven forest growth.In the 1980s, as part of an experiment in converting bogs to timber-producing forests, the Canadian government drained large areas of the Alberta swamps and planted black spruce, carefully spaced for maximum growth.The new spruce trees gorged themselves on the groundwater out of the swamps, growing unusually wide canopies—which choked out the peat moss. A different, drier moss replaced it—kindling in the place of fire retardant—and as the land dried the trees grew into enormous stores of fuel.The land “surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point,” the team wrote, creating a positive feedback loop. As the spruce trees grew, binding carbon from the atmosphere, they pulled up more water, which let them grow ever bigger—which let them pull more water, and the cycle continued.When the fire came, all that stored carbon went right back into the atmosphere: in growing trees, the McMaster team found, Alberta had inadvertently turned a carbon sink into a carbon emitter.The Fort McMurray fires were far from the only example of how large-scale tree planting can have the opposite effects intended. Last year, a group of Chinese groundwater ecologists reviewed the results of one of the aggressive campaigns of afforestation—the process of growing forests where they had not been before—that has helped China lead the world in forest growth.Since 1952, the Politburo, like its opposite numbers in Ottawa and Washington D.C., has presided over aggressive tree planting on the country’s arid fringes: in this case, the far north, where desertification threatens.But in doing so, the Chinese researchers found, foresters planted huge tracts of thirsty nonnative trees, that, the ecologists found, had sucked up the groundwater as they grew, dropping the water table to dangerous levels. This suggested that China’s impressive-on-paper forest growth could be preparing the country for a greater disaster in the future.Much of Fort McMurray was destroyed by fire in 2016, including these properties in the Waterways neighbourhood.“The afforestation program must be urgently reassessed,” they wrote, with future species selected for drought tolerance and ability to subsist on little water. The legacy of a management regime that optimized for one metric—number of trees to hold back the desert or maximum production for lumber—had laden the future with perverse consequences.USDA scientist North faces the impacts of a similar policy in California. The “pines in lines” method became standard practice not because it's the best way to grow a healthy or biodiverse forest—though the older generation of foresters will go to the mat defending it—but because, North said, “it grows the fastest board feet possible” to end up in houses and buildings.At 12-foot increments, the fast-growing, straight ponderosa pines the Forest Service plants out west are perfectly optimized to get as big as possible, while still remaining close enough for their canopies to shade out competing trees and shrubs.But by growing big, they also mine groundwater from a dry region—and when wildfire comes, those 12-foot increments are just right for it to race along.“Pine plantations are notoriously, incredibly flammable until they’re 60 to 80 years old,” North said. Till they’re big enough for their crowns to be out of reach of flames, “if a fire goes through a 12x12 pine plantation it just gets vaporized. The trees go up like matchsticks.”To Sofia Faruqi, a forest economist with WRI, California’s pine monocultures are a case study in the problems with a one-size-fits-all approach to forestry.“If you take the perspective that no matter what, more trees are better, that’s going to have unintended consequences,” she said. Restoration policy can no longer fail to address what kind of trees are being planted, or how it jibes with the larger health of the forest, the amount of water available, or the needs of local people. “In the case of the West Coast, restoration may mean removing trees from the landscape.”Faruqi’s point was not that we should slow a rush toward growing forests—WRI’s position is that the need for rapid reforestation is urgent—or even that that arid or marginal lands can’t be targets for afforestation. A lot of studies, like this recent one from a team at the Weizman Institute of Science, have found that trees in arid lands can increase rainfall beyond what they take up; the Weizman researchers estimated that 10 percent of the global afforestation potential is in arid lands.But forests are complex and intricately adapted to the land they grow on. The tools for managing them, by contrast, are often simple and counterproductive, mandated by faraway bureaucrats—or by economic systems—that fail to account for the role of healthy ecosystems on the productive capacity of the land that the economy rests on.That places a number of institutional hurdles in the path of effective reforestation. Numerous ecological economics studies have tried to track the value of reforestation: a Restoration Ecology study estimated the value of full international commitment on the Bonn Challenge at as much as $9 trillion in benefits; meanwhile, an Ecological Economics study found that impaired ecosystems cost world agriculture $6.3 trillion a year.“Research in Latin America and Africa shows that every dollar you spend on restoration means $7 to $30 in benefits,” Farqui said. “But that doesn’t make it into financial models or public decision-making, and policymakers often leave the people most affected out of the room.“Instead, we’re subsidizing things like logging and agriculture that lead to forests being cut, and not subsidizing the forests that are being lost.”That sentence conjures up images of soy plantations marching into the Amazon, but it’s a problem in North America as well. North Carolina, home of some of the most bio-diverse forests in the continental United States, gives landowners property tax breaks to sell their forests for logging—but not to conserve them.The impact, notes Adam Colette of the Dogwood Alliance, a local land rights organization, is that as the world is recognizing the carbon-storing power of standing forests, if North Carolinians want to keep their forests, the tax code requires them to pay for the privilege.“We’re not even at the point of arguing for incentivizing forests,” he said. “We’re just fighting to make it an even playing field.”To Faruqi, the solution to the policy problem and the financial problem are linked: national governments should do what they have for the solar or wind industry: subsidize, and let private industry and individual actors do the rest.One thing that would unlock a rush of capital almost immediately, she argues, is a price on carbon, which would signal to the financial system that forests have a value beyond their lumber.“Carbon,” she noted, “is also much easier to account for than things like biodiversity or erosion control.”A carbon price could help align market incentives with ecological and social ones. Still, a core danger looms over the commitments made at Bonn: the trouble with metrics, wrote social scientist Donald Campbell, is that they have a tendency to become ends in themselves, shifted by actors with their own goals until they “distort and corrupt the social processes [they are] intended to monitor.”The main danger of Bonn, said Crystal Davis, who studies forest governance for WRI, “is that ‘restoration’ happens in ways that aren’t good for environment or the forests.” The history of the American West suggests that millions of acres of trees, in and of themselves, will not necessarily pose a long-term climate solution, especially if the policies for planting them are established by faraway national governments.“You can really only determine what the best approach to restoration is at the local level, by factoring in local considerations and local needs,” Davis said.On the ground, where people live off the land or use forest products, the value of a healthy ecosystem isn’t abstract or metrics-driven—particularly in Africa, where two thirds of the population still works as farmers.Last year, WRI held a Land Accelerator in Africa for local startups focused on restoration. Some 245 applicants competed for about a dozen spots: winners focused on businesses like growing cashew trees on degraded cropland; raising quick-growing bamboo for the fiber market; or producing organic fertilizers that are affordable for African farmers.That’s part of a larger trend in which locals, given the capacity, work to restore their own lands. In Ethiopia, for example, groups of volunteer farmers have carried out mass improvements to the landscape that have turned the countryside green, outstripping the effects of climate change; a 2016 report by the UN Food and Agriculture organization found that community forestry, while imperfect, is a powerful means of growing and keeping resilient forests.But, the FAO found, community initiatives needed more support and capacity; the trouble in all this, WRI’s Davis lamented, is that there simply isn’t enough money available for local initiatives.When they go out to begin replanting in the wreckage of the King Fire, North said, they will try a different variety of local initiative: a strategy called Individual-Cluster-Open, or ICO: a mixture of individual trees (which can grow big), clusters of trees (which support each other through their mycorrhizal networks), and open spaces that can fill with shrubs or new species and serve as firebreaks.Based on Israeli experience with dryland reforestation, they also advocate that USDA foresters mix in a variety of species, rather than just the quickest growing pines, catering the species they plant to local microclimates: an approach more like a vast, variegated garden than traditional monolithic silviculture.And in response to the funding squeeze, they’ll do something even more extraordinary: when they go back in to the “green donut,” the USDA will likely leave most of it unplanted. They will leave the inner edges of the burned lands alone to slowly fill in with natural seedlings; picking only the most promising microclimates to try the ICO method.And on the steepest terrain, they will use a method, borrowed from Latin America, that North described as almost heretical to American forestry: the “founder stand,” in which a small grove is planted and left to grow and seed, over time, an entire hillside.This raises an important, often-forgotten characteristic of forests: left to their own devices, they expand. In a recent study, Brazilian ecologists charged with reforesting a cleared forest planted with virulent African cattle grass compared what happened when they cleared the grass and planted trees—versus just clearing the grass.To their delight, they found tree-planting was unnecessary: five years after harrowing the grass, the tests plots were full of native trees. Future foresters, they wrote in Forest Ecology and Management, should try “first evaluating the potential for natural regeneration and then gradually eliminating barriers."That may be a valuable lesson for the mission of re-growing the global forest: sometimes it’s less a perspective of taking action than of removing obstacles and getting out of the way.Soon, perhaps, those founder stands will rise over the burnt hills of Sierra Nevada, releasing their cones to roll downhill and plant new trees, and new ones after them. And if nothing stops them, until they find their natural limit, they will grow, and grow, and grow.",

"The purpose of cities is to bring people together. In the 20th century, we blew them apart. One day last year, Peter Calthorpe took me on a drive through some of the wreckage. He wanted to show me how he proposes to make cities whole again.Calthorpe is an architect who in the late 1970s helped design one of the first energy-efficient state office buildings, which still stands in Sacramento, California. But he soon widened his focus. “If you really want to affect environmental outcomes and social outcomes, it’s not shaping a single building that matters,” he says. “It’s shaping a community.”Today he runs a small but globally influential urban design firm, Calthorpe Associates. In his spare, airy office in Berkeley, the charter of the Congress for the New Urbanism hangs framed on the wall, denouncing “the spread of placeless sprawl.” Calthorpe helped launch the group in 1993. The struggle is long and ongoing.We waited until late morning for the traffic to settle a bit, then got into Calthorpe’s midnight blue Tesla and set a course for Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco on the far side of the distended metropolis.WELWYN GARDEN CITY, ENGLAND A century ago, when British urban planner Ebenezer Howard envisioned two “garden cities” north of London, people were starting to flee overcrowded cities in Europe and America. Some of Howard’s ideas still seem forward-looking, such as the way he gave Welwyn residents easy access to both green spaces and the metropolis—London is just a half hour away by train.“The problem with urban environments that are auto oriented,” he said, as we wound our way toward the Bay Bridge, “is that if there’s no choice, if the only way to get around is in a car, lo and behold, people are going to use cars too much. Too much for the climate, too much for people’s pocketbooks, too much for the community in terms of congestion, too much for people’s time. I mean, every way you measure it, it has a negative—no walking is a prescription for obesity. Air quality feeds into respiratory illnesses.”In the 1990s Calthorpe scored a breakthrough: He helped persuade Portland, Oregon, to build a light-rail line instead of another freeway and to cluster housing, offices, and shops around it. “Transit-oriented development” sealed his reputation as an urban visionary; in Beijing, I met an environmental scientist who has taken many Chinese planners to visit Portland. It was less of a new idea, Calthorpe said, than a call “to reinvent the old streetcar suburb, where you had fabulous downtowns and you had walkable suburbs, and they were linked by transit.”On the bridge, despite leaving late, we hit stop-and-go traffic.In Calthorpe’s utopia, in China or America or elsewhere, cities would stop expanding so voraciously, paving over the nature around them; instead they’d find better ways of letting nature into their cores, where it can touch people. They’d grow in dense clusters and small, walkable blocks around a web of rapid transit. These cities of the future would mix things up again: They’d no longer segregate work from home and shopping, as sprawl does now, forcing people into cars to navigate all three; they’d no longer segregate rich from poor, old from young, and white from black, as sprawl does, especially in the United States. Driving less, paving less, city dwellers would heat the air and the planet around them less. That would slow the climate change that threatens, in this century, to make some cities unlivable.To do all this, in Calthorpe’s view, you don’t really need architectural eye candy or Jetsons technology—although a bit of that can help. You need above all to fix the mistakes and misconceptions of the recent past.BAKU, AZERBAIJAN This oil-rich capital, the country’s largest city, has followed the Dubai model of urban development: trophy buildings first, an overall plan later. The Flame Towers are meant to evoke flares at natural gas seeps; at night, simulated flames dance on their facades, which are covered with LEDs. The skyscrapers house an upscale hotel, luxury apartments, and a mall with a Lamborghini showroom.South of the San Francisco airport, Calthorpe turned off the Bayshore Freeway. We were headed for Palo Alto, where he grew up in the 1960s, but we’d really come to drive El Camino Real—the road once traveled by Spanish colonists and priests. “It was the old Mission Trail,” he said. “And right now, it runs through the heart of Silicon Valley, and it’s just low-density crap.”Town after town spooled by, tire shop after U-Haul dealer after cheap motel. El Camino is one of the oldest commercial strips in the western United States, and it’s not the ugliest. To Calthorpe, its interest is not as an eyesore but as an opportunity. Not many people live on the road, because it’s mostly zoned for commercial use. Yet Silicon Valley is desperately short of housing. Tens of thousands of people commute in cars from throughout Northern California. In Mountain View, home of Google, hundreds actually live in parked cars.Along the 45-mile stretch of El Camino between San Francisco and San Jose, within half a mile of the road, there are 3,750 commercial parcels occupied by a motley collection of mostly one- or two-story buildings. Calthorpe knows this from the software he and his colleagues have developed, called UrbanFootprint, which draws on a nationwide parcel-by-parcel database and a series of analytical models to game out visions of the future for cities to consider. If El Camino were lined with three- to five-story apartment buildings, Calthorpe explained, with stores and offices on the ground floor, it could hold 250,000 new homes. You could solve the Silicon Valley housing shortage and beautify the place at the same time, while reducing carbon emissions and water consumption and wasted human hours.ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS In the city’s historic district, the new Market Hall aims to inspire with its originality—but also to create “a space where we could celebrate and we could meet each other,” says architect Winy Maas. The arched apartment building covers a food market that’s open daily, as well as bars and restaurants.In that 45-mile “ribbon of urbanism,” children would walk to school again. Their parents would walk to the grocery store and walk or bike to work—or jump on public transit to head up or down the strip. Transit is the key: It would have to be ubiquitous and fast. But it wouldn’t be light rail this time, Calthorpe said. That’s too expensive now, and a better technology is coming.It’s one many urban planners are terrified of: driverless autonomous vehicles, or AVs. Calthorpe himself thinks that, if AVs are left to individuals or the likes of Uber or Lyft, they will metastasize sprawl. He wants to harness the technology to benefit communities. Down the center of El Camino, on dedicated, tree-lined lanes, he would run autonomous shuttle vans. They’d arrive every few minutes, pass each other at will, and stop rarely, because an app would group passengers by destination. On their protected lanes, as Calthorpe envisions it, the little robots wouldn’t run over people—and the technology wouldn’t run over our world with its unintended consequences.Calthorpe is a onetime hippie, but of the techno-friendly Whole Earth Catalog kind. In the late 1960s he taught at an alternative high school in the Santa Cruz Mountains, helping the kids build geodesic domes. The valley below wasn’t yet nicknamed for Silicon; it was still the Valley of Heart’s Delight, covered in fruit orchards. In the foothills, an interstate highway was under construction, to relieve congestion on El Camino and the Bayshore Freeway. “In those days, you couldn’t even see the valley,” Calthorpe recalled. “It was just a sea of smog. It was just really clear that something was profoundly wrong.” Today there’s less smog, but the city is still broken, and on his good days, it still seems fixable to him.When the Congress for the New Urbanism held its annual meeting last year in Savannah, Georgia, the keynote speaker was Jan Gehl, an urban designer from Copenhagen. An oracular octogenarian, Gehl is revered for his simple insights: Architects and urban designers should build “cities for people” (the title of one of Gehl’s books, translated into 39 languages), not cars. They should pay attention to the “life between buildings” (another book title), because it’s crucial to our well-being. Gehl has spent decades observing how people behave in public spaces, collecting data on which kinds encourage civic life and which tend to be dispiriting and empty.“There is great confusion about how to show the city of the future,” he said as we sat at an outdoor café on a square shaded by live oaks. From time to time a horse clopped by, pulling a carriage full of tourists. “Every time the architects and visionaries try to paint a picture, they end up with something you definitely would not like to go anywhere near.”SINGAPORE Can a high-rise city be a garden city? Singapore subsidizes vertical gardens like these on the 627-foot Oasia Hotel. Designed by a local firm, the building is cooled by 54 species of trees and flowering vines, which attract bugs and birds—and soothe jangled nerves.He opened his laptop and showed me a Ford Motor Company website called the City of Tomorrow. The image showed a landscape of towers and verdant boulevards with scattered humans and no sign of them interacting.“Look at how fun it is to walk there,” Gehl said dryly. “There are only a few hostages down there among the autonomous cars.”“Towers in the park,” as New Urbanists call this kind of design, is a legacy of modernist architecture, whose godfather was Le Corbusier. In 1925 he proposed that much of central Paris north of the Seine be razed and replaced with a grid of 18 identical glass office towers, 650 feet high and a quarter mile apart. Pedestrians would walk on “vast lawns” gazing up at “these translucent prisms that seem to float in the air.” Cars would whiz by on elevated expressways. Cars, Le Corbusier thought, had made the streets of Paris, “this sea of lusts and faces,” obsolete.Like most of Le Corbusier’s ideas, the Plan Voisin was never built. But his influence was nonetheless global. It’s seen in the notorious housing projects of American city centers—some since demolished—and in the corporate office parks that dot the suburban landscape. It lives on too in the dozens of entirely new cities now being planned and built all over the world, especially in Asia. Many of those cities claim to prioritize walking and public transit, says Sarah Moser, a McGill University urban geographer who has studied them, but most in fact don’t. Putrajaya, Malaysia’s new federal administrative center, is a good example: Half of it is devoted to green space. But as Moser points out, “it takes a lot of walking to get from building to building.”The Helix, a bridge designed to look like DNA and lit by LEDs at night, completes a walkway around Marina Bay. Singapore has its share of eye-catching architecture, including the lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum.Nature climbs the red trellises of the Supertrees located in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay and crowns the SkyPark that bridges the towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Ebullient tropical flora surges into the courtyard and pours from the terraces of the Lucasfilm building. Singapore, an island city-state with limited space, has to plan carefully to retain links to nature and to its past.As the city grew rapidly, the government decided to preserve Kampong Glam, a 19th-century Muslim neighborhood around Sultan Mosque, which now has trendy boutiques and restaurants.The influence of Le Corbusier is felt especially in the new urban districts that China has slapped up over the past four decades. Calthorpe, who spoke at the Savannah conference, argued that those regiments of identical apartment towers, lined up on quarter-mile-long “superblocks,” have something in common with American suburbs, as different as they appear.“There’s one unified problem,” he said, “and it’s sprawl.” The essence of sprawl, he explained, is “a disconnected environment.” People living in high-rise towers in a park can be just as disconnected—from their neighbors and from the unwalkable street below—as people living on suburban cul-de-sacs. In China’s new towns, narrow streets lined with shops have given way to 10-lane boulevards, crowded with cars rather than bicyclists and pedestrians. “The social and economic fabric is being destroyed,” Calthorpe said.Sprawl happened in the United States for reasons that made it seem like a good idea at the time. Millions of soldiers had come home from World War II to overcrowded, run-down cities; their new families needed a place to live. Driving to the suburbs felt liberating and modern. In China, sprawl happened for good reasons too.In People’s Square in Shanghai I toured an exhibit on the city’s history with Pan Haixiao, a transportation researcher at Tongji University. When he arrived as a student in 1979, traffic was already terrible, he said—not because there were so many cars but because of “the very fine urban fabric,” the dense network of narrow streets. In those days, it could take Pan two hours to go downtown from the university, less than four miles away.Wouldn’t it have been quicker to walk? I asked.“At that time, we didn’t have enough food,” Pan said. “If you walk, you’ll feel very tired. We were always hungry when I was a student.”LA PAZ, BOLIVIA Transit binds a city: When La Paz sent its first cable cars sailing over congested mountain roads in 2014, it linked mostly poor El Alto to downtown, 1,300 feet below. By 2018 nine lines were carrying 250,000 people a day. Cabins arrive every 10 to 12 seconds.LA PAZ, BOLIVIA The Orange Line cable cars pass over La Llamita cemetery. A 10th line is scheduled to open this spring and an 11th in the future.In the 40 years since Deng Xiaoping decreed the “reform and opening” of China, as its population swelled to 1.4 billion, the country has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. It has done so essentially by drawing them from the countryside to factory jobs in cities. China’s breakneck urbanization is all the more remarkable for having been preceded by Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, which sent millions of people the other way, from cities into the country.“After the Cultural Revolution, the first thing was to make everybody have a home and have enough food,” said He Dongquan, a Beijing environmental scientist who is China director for Energy Innovation, a U.S.-based think tank. He grew up in the ’70 and ’80s in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, an industrial city his parents had helped build. It’s now economically distressed—but in its prime it gave young He access to electricity, clean water, and education, for which he considers himself lucky.As the urbanization drive began, He said, there was a rush to build apartments—and the quickest way was to churn out cookie-cutter towers on superblocks. The financial incentives were powerful, and not just for developers; Chinese city governments can get half or even more of their local revenue from selling land rights. Urban design niceties were overlooked—although following the dictates of feng shui, the towers generally were lined up in orderly, south-facing rows.Just as with American suburbs, which helped realize millions of American dreams, the results are great, to a degree. The average Chinese family now has 360 square feet of space per person, four times the average of two decades ago. But the spaces between the buildings are uninviting, He said, so people don’t use them.“Everybody feels lonely and nervous,” He said. Fearing crime, residents demand fences, turning superblocks into gated communities. The city becomes even less friendly and walkable.Meanwhile, in the past 20 years, the number of private cars in China has gone from negligible to nearly 190 million. Beijing now has seven concentric ring roads rippling outward from the Forbidden City. Seventy percent of the transport infrastructure investment in rapidly developing cities is for cars, said Wang Zhigao, director of the low-carbon cities program at the Energy Foundation China, an internationally funded nonprofit.Public transit is excellent, by American standards, but not good enough to lure enough people out of cars. Part of the problem, in Beijing and other cities, is the sprawling urban form—the legacy of all those years of building hastily. “If we don’t make the urban form right, it will be there for hundreds of years,” Wang said. “If we continue to provide a driving environment, people will drive, and we’ll still be high carbon, even with electric vehicles.” China still gets most of its electricity from coal.A decade ago, Wang and He got wind of a new development called Chenggong, in the southwestern city of Kunming. Planned for 1.5 million people, it was a typical Chinese new town: The main street was 90 yards across from curb to curb, 200 from building to building. “We contacted Peter and some other experts then, and they were shocked,” Wang recalled. “They said, ‘This street is not for human beings.’ ”The Energy Foundation flew Calthorpe and an architect from Gehl’s firm to Kunming to talk with city officials. “That first lecture, they started buying into the ideas,” Wang said. Ultimately the Energy Foundation paid for Calthorpe to redo the plan for Chenggong. “It was already planned, and they already had started the infrastructure,” Calthorpe recalls. “They had already laid out the superblocks.” Where it was still possible, he divided each one into nine squares, like a tic-tac-toe board, with smaller roads. He put the buildings closer to the street, with stores on the ground level below offices and apartments.The project, still under construction, became the first of many that Calthorpe and a young colleague, Zhuojian (Nelson) Peng, have worked on in China. It got the attention of the national housing ministry. And it reinforced a change in mind-set that already was bubbling up from Chinese urban planners—one that then got ratified in a startling way. In 2016 the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, the highest organs of the state, issued a decree: From now on Chinese cities were to preserve farmland and their own heritage; have smaller, unfenced blocks and narrower, pedestrian-friendly streets; develop around public transit; and so on. In 2017 the guidelines were translated into a manual for Chinese planners called Emerald Cities. Calthorpe Associates wrote most of it.“We were a little surprised,” said Zou Tao, director of the Tsinghua Tongheng Urban Planning and Design Institute in Beijing, who also contributed to Emerald Cities. “For more than 10 years we’ve been telling people to do this. We’re still getting used to it—and still figuring out how to make it happen in the real world.”Chinese urbanization is at a turning point. The government aims to move nearly 300 million more people—almost equal to the entire U.S. population—into cities by 2030. China faces both a shortage of decent affordable housing and a housing bubble, because many people invest in apartments and keep them off the market, said Wang Hao, a planner who spent 20 years at the Chinese Academy of Urban Planning and Design. “Half the people have moved into the city; the other half can’t afford it,” she said. The government is trying, all at once, to design cities more humanely and sustainably and deflate the housing bubble without crashing the economy. No one is sure how to do all that, Wang said.The key test may come in Xiongan, a 680-square-mile stretch of swampy land, including a heavily polluted lake, about 65 miles southwest of Beijing. In April 2017 President Xi Jinping announced, again to general surprise, that he wanted to build a new city there. Ultimately it could house five million people and relieve congestion and pollution in Beijing. Last summer, when I visited the site with He and a vanload of planners, all that had been built was a temporary city hall complex. Chinese tourists strolled the treelined streets. An autonomous shuttle bus circulated experimentally and emptily.PUTRAJAYA, MALAYSIA The federal administrative center was planned in the 1990s to relieve congestion in nearby Kuala Lumpur. The new city has devoted more than a third of its area to green space—but walking distances are long.Xi has declared Xiongan a project for the millennium. A video in the visitors center shows a low-rise, small-block, and extremely green city. It isn’t supposed to be completed until after 2035—an eternity by Chinese standards—but the master plan approved in December suggests it will be consistent with the Emerald Cities rule book. Calthorpe hopes to design part of it.“We’re trying to solve all Chinese city problems,” said a landscape architect I met, a woman who preferred not to be identified. “We’re not sure we’re going to. This place will be an experiment.”The next morning, He took me to see a more spontaneous experiment: a trendy arts district called 798, which lies in northeastern Beijing between the fourth and fifth rings. We waited until midmorning for the subway crowds to thin out—during the morning rush, the queues at some stations stretch all the way outside, because everyone is leaving one district to work in another. The nearest station to 798 was a few superblocks and about a mile away. Fortunately, dockless shared bikes have lately invaded the capital. We rented a couple and pedaled off.It was a warm late-summer day, with a blue “meeting sky”—African heads of state were in town, He said, so the government had shut down smoke-spewing factories outside Beijing. The 798 district occupies the site of old factories that used to be outside the city too, before the city engulfed them. After the government closed the complex in the 1990s, artists began occupying the low brick buildings. Gradually a neighborhood of galleries, bars, and shops emerged. The blocks are small because they were laid out for a factory compound.“This is very close to Portland,” He said, as we strolled the narrow streets. “We always take Portland as a good example.”In an alley under a large, idle smokestack, we sipped cappuccinos, discussing the dramatic ideological change in Chinese urban planning. Undoing the effects of 30 years of superblock construction, He said, won’t be easy. “Given the scale and the economic challenges, it will take 20 to 30 years. You see points, small pieces here and there. We hope that over time, all the urban landscape will change.”In the U.S. landscape too, islands of hope are emerging in the sea of sprawl.Ellen Dunham-Jones, an architect and urban designer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, one of the most sprawling cities on Earth, keeps a database of them. In 2009, when she and June Williamson of the City College of New York cowrote their book Retrofitting Suburbia, they reviewed around 80 cases of suburban spaces being transformed, mostly into something urban—that is, denser and more walkable. Today the number of projects in the database has grown to 1,500. Across the country, Dunham-Jones told me, developers are adding buildings mixing residential and retail to some 170 office parks. As online shopping kills hundreds of malls, she said, around 90 are in the process of “becoming the downtowns their suburbs never had.”Market forces are driving the transition. The nuclear family for whom suburban subdivisions were envisioned is no longer the statistical norm; only a little over a quarter of all U.S. households consist of people with children. Young people are looking for an urban lifestyle, and so are many of the parents they left behind in the suburbs. In the little towns around Atlanta, as elsewhere in the U.S., Dunham-Jones said, “main streets were mostly killed off in the 1970s. Now that the malls are dying, those main streets are coming back.”SHANGHAI, CHINA An elevated walkway allows pedestrians to survive the Mingzhu Roundabout in Pudong and to navigate among the widely spaced office buildings and malls. Roughly a quarter million Chinese die on the roads each year; more than half are pedestrians or cyclists.In Duluth, Georgia, 25 miles northeast of Atlanta in Gwinnett County, I visited one. Gwinnett was farm country until sprawl hit like a tsunami, Chris McGahee, Duluth’s economic development director, told me. From 1970 to 2008, the county’s population ballooned from 72,000 to 770,000, Duluth’s from 1,800 to 25,000. “When you leave to go to college, you come back and can’t find anything you remember,” McGahee said. “Except in downtown Duluth, there’s a little string of eight buildings that are more than a hundred years old. For some reason, they survive.”McGahee started work in October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. Out of the pain grew opportunity. “What the recession did for us is make land affordable,” he said. Over the next few years the town managed to buy 35 acres around those eight buildings along the railroad tracks. The buildings were nothing special, just little brick relics from the late 19th century. But they had charm and emotional weight.They’ve now become the nucleus of a restaurant district with a music venue that offers experiences people can’t get online. Around that Main Street, the town is working to have 2,500 units of housing within a 10-minute walk. Townhomes are selling out before they’re finished, McGahee said. He lives in one and walks to work at the monumental city hall, which faces a large green.The most ambitious revitalization project in the Atlanta area is the BeltLine: an effort to breathe new life into a 22-mile loop of abandoned railway lines around the city center. Five segments of the loop, about a third of the total, are now a paved trail for walking and jogging, biking and skating.“The economic story is a wild success,” said Ryan Gravel, who first envisioned the BeltLine in 1999 for his master’s in urban planning at Georgia Tech. The $500 million that Atlanta has invested in it has stimulated four billion dollars in development, Gravel said, mostly on the city’s east side. Where the Eastside Trail crosses Ponce de Leon Avenue, for example, a giant old Sears, Roebuck warehouse has become the Ponce City Market, a food hall, mall, and office complex. A Ford factory that once made Model T’s is now loft apartments.But Gravel’s idea was that the BeltLine could bind the fragmented city more powerfully: It was meant to be a streetcar line as well, one that would spur economic development and affordable housing in the places that needed it most—the African-American neighborhoods in the south and west of the city. MARTA, the Atlanta transit authority, has built one small streetcar line and has a $2.7 billion expansion plan. But it has no plans to build the whole 22-mile loop anytime soon. Gravel worries that “the promise won’t ever be delivered.”He grew up in Chamblee, a suburb to the northeast, “going to the mall, stuck in traffic on I-285,” he said. “Practically every year they added another lane.” Then in college he spent a year in Paris. He discovered a functioning subway and the joy of wandering the streets aimlessly. “I learned how to walk in Paris,” he said. He came back to Atlanta to be part of changing it.From the Ponce City Market, we walked south to an old telephone factory, where Gravel plans to open a café and forum to bring people together to talk about the Atlanta they want. Joggers and cyclists and pedestrians streamed by us on the trail. The rail line had always been a physical barrier that separated neighborhoods; now it’s a place that connects people.“That’s kind of beautiful,” Gravel said.A century ago, as the Ford plant on Ponce de Leon was starting to churn out Model T’s, Atlanta was shooting outward along streetcar lines. Many major cities in the U.S. were doing the same, stretching tentacles of rail into the countryside and building villages around the stations. Until after World War II, Los Angeles had the world’s most extensive urban rail network, more than a thousand miles of track.All transit modes intersect at the Wenshui metro stop in northern Shanghai, where the cyclists who once dominated Chinese streets are protected by a dedicated lane.If you’re middle-aged in Shanghai, you remember when the Pudong skyline, seen from the old town, didn’t exist. China’s incredible building boom is a source of pride—and its legacy of hasty planning is a challenge for the future.How will we get around cities in the future? One promising possibility is driverless minibuses, which are getting a trial at Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.Will the cities we build be built for us? Will they be places we flee if we can or places that draw us together? In one of Singapore’s newest pocket parks, a family explores a playground in front of a shaded café.“That is what creates the urban form,” said Joe DiStefano, a longtime colleague of Calthorpe’s who runs the UrbanFootprint business. “Berkeley is a walkable place because the urban form was generated by the investment in a streetcar system.” Even in spread-out Los Angeles, most places were within walking distance of a transit stop, until the city and the country shifted, DiStefano said, “until the automobile made it possible for us to travel broader distances on our own—the automobile, and trillions of dollars of investment in the infrastructure to move it.”Los Angeles became the paragon of car culture. But these days it’s trying to move out of that trap—back to the future. Since 2008, Los Angeles County voters have twice approved, by two-thirds majorities, half-cent hikes in the sales tax to pay for an extensive transit expansion—in part, no doubt, because they hope it will get other people off the freeway. “We have soul-crushing congestion,” said Therese McMillan, chief planning officer for Metro, the transit authority. The Expo light-rail line to Santa Monica was completed in 2016; the Purple subway line is being extended nine miles, from downtown to near UCLA; and a light-rail line is planned to the southeast—along an old streetcar right-of-way.Transit alone can’t fix Los Angeles; ridership actually fell last year. “Driving’s too cheap, housing’s too expensive,” said Michael Manville, an urban planner at UCLA. People have to pay to ride transit, but not to drive the freeway or to park in most places. Meanwhile, an affordable-housing crisis brought on by gentrification and citizen resistance to multifamily housing pushes low-income people, the ones most likely to ride public transit, to the fringes of the metropolis, where public transit is sparse.Change is happening: In Santa Monica I met one architect, Johannes Van Tilburg, who has designed 10,000 units of housing near transit lines in the past 15 years. But can the whole fabric of a sprawling city be changed?“I think the answer is absolutely yes,” DiStefano said. It took us only 50 years to blow up a walkable urban form that had endured millennia, he said; we could undo that in another 50. DiStefano worked with Calthorpe on the El Camino thought experiment. “That corridor is Anywhere, U.S.A.,” he said. The same opportunity exists on strips around the country—the same opportunity to create walkable, connected cities to house a growing population, without cutting another tree or paving another mile.Before Anywhere, U.S.A., is reimagined, however, it’s likely to be hit by the next explosive new technology. Self-driving cars should ultimately be safer than human-driven ones. Bombing along bumper to bumper in 60-mile-an-hour platoons, they may increase road capacity and reduce the space we devote to parking. But by the same logic, they could also dramatically increase the number of vehicle miles traveled, as robotic Uber and Lyft taxis deadhead around the metropolis 24/7, waiting for fares, and as personal-AV owners leave them spinning in traffic to go shopping. And consider, finally, the new impetus that robotic chauffeurs could inject into urban sprawl. If your car becomes a self-driving office or living room or bedroom, how far would you be willing to commute in it?How about if your car were a plane? In a hangar south of San Jose, I got a glimpse of a future that may not be far off. The hangar belonged to a company called Kitty Hawk, and it contained four little aircraft with cheerful yellow fuselages. Each wing had six electric propellers pointed upward. Cora, as the plane is called, takes off like a helicopter and runs on battery power. It has two seats, and neither is for a pilot—Cora flies itself. A pilot on the ground monitors its progress, taking control remotely if necessary.Former Virgin America CEO Fred Reid, who oversaw Cora until early this year, explained the rationale for self-flying planes. He began by showing me a video of that soul-crushing traffic in Los Angeles. “There’s no doubt in any thinking man’s or woman’s brain that this is not only going to happen, it has to happen,” he said. Kitty Hawk has a bunch of competitors.The initial market for Cora would be as an air taxi, Reid said. You’d arrive at LAX, say, and a Cora would whisk you a thousand feet above the traffic, flying a predetermined route. It would be relatively cheap, he said, closer to an Uber Black in price than to a helicopter. Being electric, it would be quiet and relatively green. Also, Reid added, “we try to make our planes pretty.” He pictures thousands in the skies above L.A.I’d take one in a heartbeat, I realized.But what will it be like, I asked Reid, to have thousands of these zipping around the skyline? You’re inventing a new technology that has just as much revolutionary potential as automobiles. What kind of world will it make?“We’ll figure it out,” Reid said.Maybe we will. But it might be wise to do some of the figuring first. We didn’t have to go completely nuts about cars, allowing them to become the tail that wagged the urban dog. We didn’t have to rip up all the streetcar lines. We didn’t have to forget that cities are for people—and we don’t need to do it again.When Gehl started his career in 1960, Copenhagen was choked with cars too. Gehl began as an architect in the modernist tradition, designing the kinds of buildings that he now dismisses as “perfume bottles”—sculptural compositions rather than humanistic ones. But he changed course, and so did his city. Copenhagen has committed to becoming the world’s best city for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s working. Two-fifths of all commutes now are by bike.The point is not that bikes are the answer; it’s that we can be thoughtful about the shape of our cities. “Waking up every morning and knowing that the city is a little bit better than it was yesterday—that’s very nice when you have children,” Gehl said. “Think about that … Your children have a better place to live, and your grandchildren have a better place to grow up than you could when you were young. I think that’s what it should be like.”",
"Teslas jockey for one of 12 electric-vehicle charging stations in the parking lot. A sea of mostly men gathers in the lobby of the Computer History Museum, some giving each other quick hugs. “How’s my investment going?” one shouts to another across the room. A bell chimes, and it begins to feel like church. The boisterous crowd files quickly into the auditorium and becomes quiet. The doors close. Demo Day is about to begin.Over the next two days, entrepreneurs from 132 start-ups pitch well-rehearsed two-minute spiels about how they are going to change the world. Turns out, there are countless ways to do that. Radar sensors on bedroom ceilings in nursing homes. Drones that check utility lines. Machine learning for cargo shippers. A laundry-detergent subscription service aimed at men.On average there’s a future billion-dollar company in every group, Michael Seibel, CEO and partner at Y Combinator, tells the Silicon Valley investors. “Your job is to figure out which one it is,” he says. His firm helps entrepreneurs develop their ideas.First up is Public Recreation, which offers group workouts in parking lots and other open spaces to exercisers who pay a subscription. “Our secret sauce is, we don’t pay rent,” says one of the founders.Is that a big market, I wonder as everyone claps. And what about rain, snow, insects, and high-pollen-count days? But we’re on to the next big idea—container optimization for ports using predictive algorithms. The hush in the room is respectful.During my years as a reporter writing about Silicon Valley, I’ve learned to stifle the urge to guffaw at business ideas. Billions have been made on start-ups I dismissed as toys, solving problems I didn’t know people had. Maybe if Plan A doesn’t work, Public Recreation can switch to Plan B, like Justin.tv, which started by live-streaming the antics of one person, Justin, then anyone, and then turned into Twitch Interactive, which enables one to watch others play online games. In 2014, Amazon bought it for $970 million.Maggie Ford, engineering director of the Stanford Solar Car Project, demos a solar car with her team at a September activities fair at Stanford University.Silicon Valley is a place that is always “fleeing into the future,” says Paul Saffo, a longtime Silicon Valley observer. The entrepreneurs pitching on this Demo Day paint a picture of lives made better by artificial intelligence, augmented reality, robots, drones, and sensors everywhere.Silicon Valley’s optimism and the pragmatic dreamers who keep it going have long fascinated me. But recently there’s been a sobering-up of sorts.Responsibility and empathy are the new buzzwords. Silicon Valley knows it is being held accountable for everything: the demographics of its workforce, the industries upended and the pain caused by technology, the hate spread faster because of its social networks, and even the effects of innovation on people here. Even some workers with six-figure incomes have trouble affording housing. And around the world in places such as Bolivia, mining the lithium needed to power the devices Silicon Valley invents is raising concerns about exploitation and the environment.Technology rules the future, but there’s also a grudging acknowledgment that sometimes in the pursuit of making things better and more efficient, you may be hurting people along the way.“We are surrounded by people who are dreaming big,” says Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, the personal-genomics and biotechnology firm. “The reality of Silicon Valley is on the right side of history—whether we like it or not, the world has changed. But those transitions can definitely be hard,” she says. “I think we have a responsibility to all those places that are being impacted.”“Where is Silicon Valley?” out-of-towners ask me when they visit. There’s no capital city or ground zero. There’s no Hollywood-like sign in the hills announcing Tech Town! With low mountain ranges to the east and west, Silicon Valley is a horseshoe-shaped flatland of offices and neighborhoods. Dazzling at the center are the waters of San Francisco Bay, indifferent to the roar of the traffic clogging the roads or the latest breakthrough from Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX. I point visitors to the Facebook thumbs-up “like” sign, next to the company’s expanding headquarters. Facebook doesn’t offer tours, nor do most tech companies.Of course, that “like” sign might not make everyone happy. We know Facebook’s data policies failed to protect users after a researcher sold personal information that was later used to target us with political ads, and Russian operatives stoked political hostilities in the United States by using Facebook as a propaganda arm. Tech’s epicenter might be the site in Mountain View where one of the inventors of the transistor started a company, a place that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak visited just to touch the building and see the historical marker there. It can be found in a home on a cul-de-sac in Los Altos, where an Indian-born software engineer tucks her kids into bed and gets back online to work on her start-up. Or it can be found in a recreational vehicle with three flat tires parked near Stanford University, where Jim, a Marine Corps veteran and handyman, lives with his dog, Smokey, and bathes each day with hand wipes.It’s a much different place from what it was in 1982, when National Geographic wrote about Silicon Valley’s “freewheeling egalitarianism that has replaced the rural pace” and said, “this dynamic growth happens behind a deceptively sedate facade … a monotone sprawl of low, rectangular buildings on which corporate nameplates display fusions of high-technology words that give few clues as to what goes on inside.”Along winding roads in the surrounding hills where deer feed, one can imagine the people here living at a rural pace. Once the home of apricot and plum orchards, the valley has just last year seen the shuttering of a landmark cherry stand and the closure of Orchard Supply Hardware, which was founded in San Jose during the Great Depression. Yet Silicon Valley can fool you: It looks egalitarian, open, and casual, with CEOs in hoodies and venture capitalists in bike shorts, and it is often whimsical, with workplaces that require people to remove shoes or allow them to bring their dogs.But it’s serious about its ambition. “People are more interested in your start-up than your actual name,” complains Tristan Matthias, 24, an Australian visitor.The seeds of Silicon Valley’s appeal today began in the early 1990s. As a reporter arriving then, I thought the place felt kind of dead. The decline of the defense industry at the end of the Cold War and a downturn in the economy resulted in layoffs throughout California. The hot categories were desktop publishing, multimedia CD-ROMs, and video games.Even the great rebel—Apple—seemed to be in decline. Steve Jobs was gone, having left in 1985 after a dispute with the CEO and board; his triumphant return to the company he founded would happen more than a decade later.An idea was spreading in the mid-1990s: If people could be connected through computers, lives would change. I visited a school that was trying out connected computers with its students so teachers could send messages to parents through a dial-up modem. America Online appeared with its idea of a digital mall you could visit and order flowers from. It was clunky and hard to use, but something big was percolating.There was a party happening to the north, in Seattle. Microsoft was making computers useful and becoming rich. In August 1995, Microsoft seemed like the winner in a winner-takes-all tech contest. Its executives danced at midnight outside electronics stores, celebrating the launch of the operating system Windows 95. Meanwhile a bomb of sorts was going off in Silicon Valley.Netscape, which made “browser” software that allowed users to move around the internet, went public less than a year after its signature product was released. Although Netscape was an unproven company with pages of risks outlined for investors, its stock price closed at $58.25 on opening day, giving the company an instant market value of $2.9 billion.Netscape’s initial public offering (IPO) was the beginning of what came to be known as the dot-com boom, which saw the creation of great lasting companies such as Amazon and Yahoo!—as well as firms that cratered, such as Webvan and Pets.com.Excitement over what could be done on the internet—sell makeup, rent trucks, find dates, and more—fueled a speculative stock market. In 1999 more than 400 companies, most of them tech related, went public.Then the market crashed in 2000. More than 200,000 jobs were wiped out.Embarrassment. Suffering. And yet: “All those start-ups were right,” Wozniak, Apple’s co-founder, told me. “They were all right about what the internet would do for us. It’s just that you can’t change your ways of life that quickly.”Silicon Valley has its own words that turn failure into something positive. “Iteration” means getting a product on the market without worrying about perfection—the tweaks can come later. “Pivoting” (said without embarrassment) is sharply changing course before the money runs out.Failure and downturns clear the way for new ideas and new entrants. Google occupies part of what was once the site of Silicon Graphics, Inc., a computer company whose co-founder helped start Netscape. Facebook has updated the old Sun Microsystems campus as it has grown. The attempt to link the internet and television was a bumpy ride. But then YouTube showed up.The social media era launched. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto to grow Facebook with its hacker creed “Move Fast and Break Things.” In San Francisco a group of friends and co-workers found a way for people to give updates throughout their day in 140 characters, and Twitter was born.The great churn of Silicon Valley masks what happens to individuals. For many, innovation’s great “creative destruction” cycles are not observed from 30,000 feet but are wrenching on a personal level. Jobs lost. Skills made obsolete. Households and families upended.Apple offered another template: the comeback. With Steve Jobs back in the driver’s seat in 1997 after the company bought the other firm he started, NeXT, Apple began a slow recovery. The company released the iPod and then its digital entertainment store, iTunes. The iPhone launched in 2007, delivering on the promise of General Magic’s Magic Cap and Apple’s Newton more than 10 years earlier. Fast-forward to today, and tech companies are grappling with their dramatic impact on people’s lives. Their leaders have been called to Congress to testify about the use of customer data, the ways foreign actors have used these prized technologies to disrupt elections, and potential bias in the algorithms that control what we see.With the advent of artificial intelligence—computers learning to think like humans—data (with its partner, computational speed) has become the most important resource. The new oil. If computers can “think” one day and make decisions, then what?After more than 3,000 of Google’s employees signed a letter in protest, the company chose to not extend its contract with a Department of Defense project that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone images. Then, in November, 20,000 Google employees worldwide walked out to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment and pay-equity issues. Salesforce created an Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology following criticism of its contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.I visit John Hennessy, a former president of Stanford University and now chairman at Alphabet, the parent company of Google. He is congenial but not in a relaxed, academic way. The tech industry’s current moment of reckoning is spurring deeper questions about Silicon Valley’s purpose, he says.“The tricky thing right now is for companies to figure out how they’re going to take responsibility and govern themselves in ways that are seen as aligned with not just the interest of their shareholders but also the interest of society broadly,” he says.The young out-of-towners keep coming.“You sit in a coffee shop and hear a pitch and people talking about crypto and Google, and that’s a turnoff for some people. But I like it,” says Shriya Nevatia, a product manager from upstate New York who left Boston after graduating from Tufts University.In three years in Silicon Valley, Nevatia is on her third job. “It sounds bad, but I prefer tiny start-ups,” she says.In a leafy Palo Alto neighborhood, Joshua Browder sits poolside at the home where Facebook’s Zuckerberg stayed in the summer of 2004 as the social media site was taking off. Inside the house, Browder’s colleagues work at a dining room table on his company’s app—DoNotPay—which is like a robot lawyer fighting parking tickets and finding price loopholes for airline and hotel bookings. The condition of the kitchen—a pan caked with tomato sauce—is just part of the gestalt of the hacker life: living, working, eating, and sleeping in one place as they race to launch the product. The past and present are entwined in tech legends—people who live, work, and invest in tech. Wozniak is a sought-after speaker, getting well over a thousand invitations a year. Part of his appeal is that he’s the “other Steve” in Silicon Valley’s favorite origin story, the creation of Apple. Woz, as he is known, may be a genius, but he sees himself as a regular guy. He retells one of the most famous stories about himself: Around the time of the company’s IPO in 1980, he sold some of his Apple stock at pre-IPO prices to about 80 employees.“I have a lot of concerns about the distribution of wealth,” he says.This is Immigrant Valley today as much as Silicon Valley. The influx of foreign-born people is helping to offset an outflow to elsewhere in the U.S. In some fields, such as computers and mathematics, foreign-born workers now make up more than 60 percent of the workforce. The figure is even higher for women in those fields—78 percent are foreign-born. Indians, Chinese, and Vietnamese are the main groups of foreigners in the region’s tech industry, but people come from dozens more countries: There were 42 people from Zimbabwe working in tech in 2015 and 106 from Cuba.The international nature of Silicon Valley means companies, even small ones, have become a jumble of cultures and languages. But it also highlights who isn’t making it into the Silicon Valley dream. On average African Americans and Latinos combined make up just 12 percent of the workforce at major tech firms. Women also are vastly underrepresented in what has been called Silicon Valley’s “bro culture”: Slightly more than 30 percent of the workforce at Google, Apple, and Facebook is female. A survey released last September found that women make up just 13 percent of start-up founders and hold only 6 percent of founder equity.But women are also slowly gaining traction. In 2018, women made up 24 percent of technical jobs and 18.5 percent of firms’ leadership, according to a survey of 80 U.S. companies by AnitaB.org, a nonprofit that works to increase women in tech fields.When it comes to pay, women in tech are offered less than men more than 60 percent of the time for the same role (with an average gap of 4 percent), according to a report by Hired, a job-hiring firm. Major tech companies say they want more diverse teams, but it’s hard to change employee demographics quickly.“I’ve heard young women say Silicon Valley is bad for women, and they brace themselves for it,” says Shriya Nevatia, the product manager, over a cup of tea. She has created a group called the Violet Society to help women and nonbinary people during the first 10 years they are in tech, to help get start-ups going. She’s intrigued by the wide networks men have developed during college, through roommates, and in their early careers. Companies, seemingly founded through what seem like chance connections, actually arise from these networks. “We need more women for happenstance,” says Nevatia, who wants to bring women together in the same way.As out-of-towners continue to pour into Silicon Valley, driving up real estate and rental prices, many people here who aren’t part of the tech economy—and some who are—see life becoming more difficult, mostly because of the rising cost of housing.No place is perhaps more squeezed than East Palo Alto, a city of about 30,000 with formidable neighbors: Facebook is just to the north, and Google is to the south. For the past 50 years, the city largely has been a mixture of African-American and Latino families. Now new families, many white and Asian, are moving in. The median home price has already passed one million dollars—up from around $260,000 in 2011, according to Zillow. One million. That’s what passes for affordable housing along the peninsula that stretches from San Francisco to San Jose.For many longtime residents here who haven’t enjoyed the current tech boom, rents have escalated, and buying a home is out of reach. They move out to the edges of the area, driving for hours each day to and from work. Or they move in with family and friends. Or they leave the area altogether. “They are building one-million-dollar homes right next to homeless shelters,” says Pastor Paul Bains, who with his wife, Cheryl, runs a human-services nonprofit in East Palo Alto.Patricia Carter lives in East Palo Alto and has a full house: her grown son, his three young daughters under four, and her daughter, plus her son’s ex-partner, who lives in the garage and pays rent. Carter, a UPS driver, faced the threat of foreclosure on her three-bedroom ranch-style home, bought in 2003 for $447,000, but with help was able to save her home.Michael Seibel, the CEO of Y Combinator, sees a roughly generational shift in Silicon Valley today. Younger workers want their companies to hire diverse employees and act with a bigger social conscience. Firms, desperate to hold on to talent, are falling in line.And what about his purpose? After graduating from Yale University, Seibel planned to spend his 20s making money, his 30s being a parent, and his 40s going into politics. He moved to San Francisco in 2006 and started a company. He was co-founder and CEO of Justin.tv and Socialcam. Socialcam was sold to Autodesk in 2012, and Justin.tv eventually became Twitch Interactive. Now 36, he just became a father. But politics are out; he feels he has more social impact now.If Silicon Valley has a spiritual center, it might be the Internet Archive, a nonprofit inside a former church in San Francisco. Servers churn away day and night, archiving much of the public web in its many forms. Nearly every Wikipedia article. About four million tweets a day. More than a half million YouTube videos a week. It’s archived more than 340 billion web pages. The internet’s lost and found.Fog blowing in through open windows keeps the archive’s servers from overheating.Scattered among the pews in the archive’s Great Room are more than 120 three-foot-high statues of people who have contributed at least three years to the archive. The internet’s terra-cotta army. I recognize some of them in this eerie but powerful scene.It’s kind of creepy, these lifelike statues, some holding a book or a cup or a guitar, as if they were interrupted while working on a project or taking part in a sing-along. Or, perhaps, while arguing with each other about the right thing to do.",
"A Norwegian man loads his Tesla S for a trip to his cabin for the weekend. Norway plans to ban the sale of gas- or-diesel-powered cars by 2025.Electric vehicles will one day push gas- or diesel-powered ones to the curb—but how soon? Sooner than you might think, according to researchers at the International Monetary Fund and Georgetown University: Based on how quickly horses and buggies disappeared in the early 1900s, the researchers argue, more than 90 per cent of all passenger vehicles in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other rich countries could be electric by 2040.Along with a spate of recent commitments to electric vehicles by governments and car companies, the study offers hope about the prospects for weaning the transportation sector off carbon. Of more than one billion registered vehicles on the road today, only two million are electric (with one million of those in China). But if EVs catch on as fast as the researchers project, it could reduce oil use by 21 million barrels a day and cut CO2 emissions 3.2 billion tons a year — equivalent to 60 percent of total U.S. emissions today.Other studies project a slower rollout, although newer ones tend be more aggressive. Bloomberg New Energy Finance recently bumped up its estimate of the EV market share in 2040 from 35 per cent of all new car sales to 54 percent. RethinkX, an independent think tank, is even more bullish, saying most U.S. vehicles will be electric by 2030 —just 13 years from now.The authors of the IMF-Georgetown working paper, “Riding the Energy Transition,” base their own optimism on an analysis of past technology transitions, especially the one from horses to cars.“We were surprised at how fast cars replaced horses as the main means of transport in the early 1900s,” says IMF economist Fuad Hasanov. “It happened in only 10 to 15 years in spite of the many hurdles.” By comparison, the barriers to adopting electric vehicles today seem small.In 1910 there were few paved roads in America, and the biggest worry in cities was what to do with all the horse manure that was piling up. Gasoline was hard to find; today’s massive infrastructure of refineries and gas stations was just beginning to be built. Driving one of Henry Ford’s new Model T’s was a daunting change from a horse, with or without buggy, and it was as affordable to Americans then as a $137,000 car would have been in 2015—which is close to twice the price tag of Tesla’s Model S. Not surprisingly, very few people bought Model T’s at that price.And yet by 1921, the price had dropped to the equivalent of $35,000, governments and the oil industry had spent massively on roads and other infrastructure, and sales of Model T’s shot up to a million a year. By 1925 they were nearing two million.If electric vehicles are adopted at that pace, say Hasanov and Reda Cherif of IMF and Aditya Pande of Georgetown, they’ll account for 5 percent of all vehicles by the late 2020s and 36 percent by the early 2040s. The researchers call that the “slow-adoption scenario.”In their “fast-adoption scenario,” the researchers extrapolate the rise of electric vehicles, not from the rate at which gas-powered cars were adopted a century ago, but from the rate at which horses disappeared. That happened much faster—in part because public transit was expanding rapidly at the same time. Many people who gave up horses didn’t buy cars at first; they hopped on electric street cars.Today there’s no comparable public transit boom, and switching from gas-powered to electric cars is much easier than switching from horses to cars was a century ago. The researchers conclude that the fast-adoption scenario—which matches the actual EV adoption rate between 2011 and 2015—is much more likely.It projects 30 percent of vehicles in the U.S. will be electric by the late 2020s and 93 percent by the early 2040s.If that sounds implausible, consider cell phones, says Cherif. In the 1980s, when cell phones were bulky, expensive, and had a short battery life, experts predicted that by 2000 the industry might sell 900,000 units a year. Actual sales that year were 109 million—and by 2014 another unexpected technology transition had happened: Virtually all of those phones were smart phones.“Adoption of a new technology like electric cars may seem slow or look like it’s never going to happen,” says Cherif, “until it passes a threshold and then it just takes off.”Tesla’s new Model 3 is priced at $35,000 and can travel 220 miles on a full charge. That may be the threshold price for electric vehicles, Cherif says. Between March and June 2016, more than 400,000 people placed $1000 deposits to pre-order the Model 3—a car that didn’t yet exist. The first 100 Model 3s were delivered this past August.Those four months in 2016 may come to seem like the car and oil industries’ “Kodak Moment”. Kodak made film for cameras and was one the world’s most powerful companies; it invented the digital camera in 1975. But it failed to adapt to the new technology and filed for bankruptcy in 2012.Fearing a similar fate, just about every automaker is now jumping on the electric-powered bandwagon. Sweden’s Volvo Car Group will only produce electrified models — hybrids and fully battery powered — by 2019. Jaguar Land Rover will follow suit in 2020. VW has pledged to become the world leader in electric vehicles by 2025. Even James Bond could be driving an all-electric Aston Martin as soon as 2019.Governments are joining in. Norway will ban the sale of fossil fuel-burning cars and vans in 2025. Governments in the U.K., the Netherlands, and France have promised the same by 2040. Germany, home of Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, is talking about a similar ban.China just announced it too will ban the sales of gasoline and diesel vehicles—though it has yet to set a timetable. China is the world’s biggest car market, selling 20 million vehicles a year. It already has more than 40 different electric vehicles available, most made by Chinese companies.This past May India’s Energy Minister Piyush Goyal predicted to National Geographic that only electric vehicles will be sold in India by 2030— even without a government restriction, because they are cleaner, quieter, longer-lasting, and will cost less.In China and India but also in western Europe, air pollution is providing a big motive to go electric, says Bloomberg analyst Albert Cheung. Conversely, any reduction in government commitment to fight air pollution could slow the uptake of electric vehicles. So could super-cheap gas prices and a lack of investment in charging infrastructure.But all in all, Cheung says: “it is looking harder and harder to apply the brakes to that electric vehicle bandwagon."Stanford economist Tony Seba pushes the vision of an EV revolution a step further: He says it’s coming in the 2020s, and it will be self-driving. In a new study, “Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030”, Seba and his colleagues at RethinkX say 95 percent of all passenger miles will be in autonomous electric vehicles by 2030.How is that even possible? First, Seba assumes electric vehicles will be much cheaper to buy than today because of falling battery costs and the fact that they’re easier to manufacture and maintain — only 20 moving parts versus 2000 for gasoline or diesel vehicles. “Today’s electric vehicles have gone over 200,000 miles and all they needed were new sets of tires,” Seba says. One Tesla S has logged 500,000 miles with the same battery.Second, according to Seba, the majority of vehicles will be owned not by individuals but by transportation companies. Commercial fleets are eager for electric vehicles—especially self-driving ones. Eliminating drivers could generate huge cost savings for the likes of UPS and FedEx, Uber and Lyft. Self-driving taxis and commercial vehicles are being tested in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and Boston, as well as Singapore, Dubai, and Wuzhen, China.Cost is what will push Americans out of their driver seats, Seba says. Electric vehicles are four times more energy efficient and cheaper to fuel; autonomous ones could be even better. Owning and operating the average gasoline-powered vehicle costs close to $10,000 a year when driven 15,000 miles, according to the auto club AAA, and that vehicle is parked 95 percent of the time.In Seba’s vision, there will be 200 million fewer passenger cars on American roads in 2030. Instead there will be millions of self-driving vehicles that anyone can access with the touch of a button, to go where they want for a few pennies per mile.“Instead of spending $10,000 a year for road transportation, a family might spend only $1,000,” Seba says. “It will make no rational economic sense to own a car, because it will be so cheap to hail an autonomous electric vehicle.”But will it still make irrational, emotional sense? Aren’t cars part of the American identity? For now maybe they are—but so were horses once.",
"“You need to have your throat cut out and your decomposing, bug-infested body fed to wild pigs.” An anonymous Facebook user wrote that—and more that’s unprintable—to Kyle Edmund after the British pro tennis player lost in a 2017 tournament.After University of Cambridge classics professor Mary Beard spoke about the history of male suppression of female voices, she received Twitter threats, including “I’m going to cut off your head and rape it.”On Martin Luther King Day this year, an anonymous Twitter user lionized the man who killed King some 50 years ago: “RIP James Earl Ray. A true fighter for the white race.” The same month, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his “Nuclear Button … is a much bigger & more powerful one” than Kim Jong Un’s. This capped weeks of dueling statements in which Trump called the North Korean leader “Rocket Man” and “a madman” and Kim called Trump “a gangster” and a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”The internet is a particularly volatile place of late. Aggression on social media has reached such a pinnacle of acrimony that some U.S. House members proposed designating an annual “National Day of Civility.” The proposal drew civil responses—but also tweets and posts of wrath, ridicule, and profanity.Is this aggression on social media giving us a glimpse of human nature, one in which we are, at our core, nasty, belligerent beasts?No.It’s true that hate crimes are on the rise, political divisions are at record heights, and the level of vitriol in the public sphere, especially online, is substantial. But that’s not because social media has unleashed a brutish human nature.In my work as an evolutionary anthropologist, I’ve spent years researching and writing about how, over the past two million years, our lineage transformed from groups of apelike beings armed with sticks and stones to the creators of cars, rockets, great artworks, nations, and global economic systems.How did we do this? Our brains got bigger, and our capacities for cooperation exploded. We’re wired to work together, to forge diverse social relationships, and to creatively problem-solve together. This is the inheritance that everyone in the 21st century carries.I would argue that the increase in online aggression is due to an explosive combination of this human evolutionary social skill set, the social media boom, and the specific political and economic context in which we find ourselves—a combination that’s opened up a space for more and more people to fan the flames of aggression and insult online.Let me explain. We’ve all heard the diet-conscious axiom “You are what you eat.” But when it comes to our behavior, a more apt variation is “You are whom you meet.” How we perceive, experience, and act in the world is intensely shaped by who and what surround us on a daily basis—our families, communities, institutions, beliefs, and role models.These sources of influence find their way even into our neurobiology. Our brains and bodies constantly undergo subtle changes so that how we perceive the world plays off of, and maps to, the patterns of those people and places we see as most connected to us.How—and why—are American adults abusing one another on the internet? In 2017 the Pew Research Center crunched the numbers. In a study of some 4,000 people, four out of 10 said they’d been subjected to harassing behavior. Politics was the issue most likely to trigger the harassment: About a third of those who’d been attacked—Democrats and Republicans equally—said it was due to their political beliefs. More than half those who’d been harassed said they didn’t know the perpetrator’s identity; nearly nine out of 10 said the anonymity online provides cover for vicious and harassing behavior. Among the adults polled, slightly less than a third said they responded or took some sort of action when witnessing someone being harassed online, and slightly more than a third said they made no response. —Nina StrochlicThis process has deep evolutionary roots and gives humans what we call a shared reality. The connection between minds and experiences enables us to share space and work together effectively, more so than most other beings. It’s in part how we’ve become such a successful species.But the “who” that constitutes “whom we meet” in this system has been changing. Today the who can include more virtual, social media friends than physical ones; more information absorbed via Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram than in physical social experiences; and more pronouncements from ad-sponsored 24-hour news outlets than from conversations with other human beings.We live in complicated societies structured around political and economic processes that generate massive inequality and disconnection between us. This division alone leads to a plethora of prejudices and blind spots that segregate people. The ways we socially interact, especially via social media, are multiplying exactly at a time when we are increasingly divided. What may be the consequences?Historically, we have maintained harmony by displaying compassion and geniality, and by fostering connectedness when we get together. Anonymity and the lack of face-to-face interaction on social media platforms remove a crucial part of the equation of human sociality—and that opens the door to more frequent, and severe, displays of aggression. Being an antagonizer, especially to those you don’t have to confront face-to-face, is easier now than it’s ever been. If there are no repercussions for it, that encourages the growth of aggression, incivility, and just plain meanness on social media platforms.Since we’ll continue to be influenced by whom we meet virtually, the next question is: Whom do we want to meet? What kind of society do we want to shape and be shaped by? That is, how do we modify the whom by which our brains and bodies are being molded—and thereby reduce the aggression?Humans are evolutionarily successful because our big brains have allowed us to bond together and cooperate in more complex and diverse manners than any other animal. The capacity to observe how the world operates, to imagine how it might improve, and to turn that vision into reality (or at least make the attempt) is the hallmark of humanity.And therein lies the solution to the problem. We are equipped with the skill set both to quell aggression and to encourage cohesion.For countless millennia people have acted collectively to punish and shame aggressive antisocial actions such as bullying or abuse. On social media, where the troll is remote and anonymous, even the best intentioned individual challenge may devolve into a shouting match. But confronting the bully with a group action—a reasoned, communal response rather than a knee-jerk, solo gesture—can be more effective at shutting down aggression.When the Pew Research Center asked people how they handled their most recent exposure to online harassment, 61 percent said they ignored it. The rest said they made some sort of response; within that group, the top six responses, ranked by popularity below, ranged from confronting the harasser online to deleting or changing the name on their own account online.39% did not ignore online harassment. Here’s what they did:1. Confronted the person online2. Unfriended/blocked the person3. Reported the person responsible to website4. Confronted the person faceto-face or via text/phone call5. Discussed problem online6. Changed username/deleted profileConsider the impact of the #MeToo movement, the Time’s Up movement, and the Black Lives Matter movement. Look at the public pressure brought to bear on media corporations to monitor “fake news” and hate speech.These are excellent examples of how humans can leverage social media to nurture what’s positive and sanction what’s negative.After the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, activist students called out their Twitter trolls and shut them down. The neo-Nazi rallies have diminished, and some of the alt-right hate websites have been taken offline—all because thousands of people stood up to them and said, “No more.”Yes, it seems that the world is getting more aggressive, but that’s not because we are aggressive at our core. It’s because we haven’t been stepping up, in unison, to do the difficult social work our contemporary world demands. That means standing up against bullying, abuse, and aggressive harassment, and fostering pro-social attitudes and actions. In person and on social media, we must do both.",
"The petroglyphs at Buckhorn Wash in Utah are over 2,000 years old, but humans have been making art for much longer.What makes us human? Is war an inevitable part of the human condition? These are some of the questions that anthropologist Augustín Fuentes explores in his new book, The Creative Spark: How Imagination Made Humans Exceptional. Harnessing the latest findings in evolution, biology, and archaeology he creates a new synthesis to show that the great drivers of human progress have been creativity and cooperation, and that many of the things we believe about ourselves, from religion to race, are wrong.When National Geographic caught up with the author at his office at Notre Dame University in Indiana he explained why dogs really are man’s best friends, why the evolutionary record does not support traditional notions of gender, marriage, and family, and why President Trump’s proposal to defund the NEA and NEH may cripple our ability to get along—and make war more likely.There’s a whole range. The first one is that we are bad to the bone, evil to the core. Or at least males are. And it’s this male aggression that has driven our evolution. But the fossil, biological, ethnographical, and historical evidence show that that’s just not the case. The really obnoxious people throughout history have not been the ones who, over the long term, have influenced us the most.The second misconception is that males and females are radically different in their sexuality and gender. But while males and females are very different, there’s actually a lot more similarity than we think.The whole idea that there are these single things, like aggression or sex differences, which explain the complex evolution of what it means to be human, is just too simple. This is why I’m proposing this idea of collaboration and creativity. It’s a much more complex, and exciting, way to think about who we are and why we do what we do.There’s a huge debate around warfare. The first thing to do is to look at the archaeological and fossil evidence. What’s out there? What we see is that about 10,000-14,000 years ago we start to find examples of large scale or at least coordinated, lethal group violence, which we call war. But warfare today is not just about two groups of people fighting one another. It’s about political, economic, social, religious, and other ideologies coming into conflict and playing out in terms of violence, coercion or manipulation. That kind of warfare—large scale, intergroup violence around ideas, ideologies, money, and resources—shows up in the last 10,000 years more and more frequently because we have more stuff to fight over and more opportunities to do so.But though the world might seem more violent than ever, it’s actually not. If you were to take a slice of time at this moment, the vast majority of the 7.5 billion people on the planet are actually getting along swimmingly. They’re not engaged in horrible violence or coercion or oppression. However, that’s only part of the answer. Just because most people are getting along doesn’t mean that we haven’t created new and more horrific ways to create violence against one another.We’re in a double world right now—one where most people, most of the time, get along, but where we’ve also created a world where we are more cruel potentially and potentially more violent than ever before.Without art, we’re not human. The ability to imagine and to take that imagination and make it into reality is one of the things that is really distinctive about humans. Whether it’s painting, building airplanes, or figuring out how to make a paycheck last to the end of the month, it all stems from the same creative capacity. And there is no better way to flex that creativity muscle than to do art, be exposed to art, and to think about art.What President Trump will be doing by taking away the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for Humanities and cutting public access to art, is to rob humanity of imagination and creativity and hobble us in our capacity to get along and make a difference in the world.The devout gather to pray at a statue of the Virgin Mary in Mejugorje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Belief in something transcendant seems to be very old in human history, says author Augustin Fuentes, but organized religion is relatively recent.It depends on what we call “art.” We tend to think of these beautiful cave paintings of the big mastodons and wild oryx as art. But that’s only about 40,000 years old. We know that 85,000 years ago, in southern Africa, our ancestors were carving on ostrich eggshells. Twenty thousand years earlier than that, they were drilling holes in small shells and wearing them around their necks. One hundred thousand years before that, they were crumbling ochre and rubbing it on their bodies. Five hundred thousand years before that, half a million years ago, they were making tools that were incredibly beautiful and more symmetrical and aesthetic than they had to be to do their jobs. Art is very deep in human history.An important distinction has to be made here. There’s a huge distinction between religion, as an institution, and religiousness, or a religious individual. There’s pretty good evidence that for a long time this notion of the transcendent, there being more in the world than just the material, has been important for humans. But what is new is big, institutionalized, organized structures. Let’s take Christianity or Islam or Judaism. That’s recent! Really, really recent. We tend to confuse humans’ capacity or tendency to think there is more to the world than just what we see or touch with these huge institutions and the political, historical, and economic concepts they’re trying to push.A musher checks his dog's paw during the Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska. Canine and human evolution appear to intertwined.Absolutely! Right now, I’m in my office looking at my dog lying between two chairs, sleeping. [Laughs] The story between humans and dogs is absolutely amazing. If a biologist or scientist from another planet came to this planet one of their first questions would be, “Wow, look at these symbionts! These two organisms that are wrapped in each other’s lives.” And they would be talking about humans and dogs.The human-dog evolution is one of those examples where the idea of the creativity and complexity of evolutionary histories makes itself evident. Throughout the world, between 10,000-30,000 years ago, we start to see a couple of things happening. One is that we start to find fossils of organisms that are sort of wolf-like but have some changes to them. That’s probably the emergence of dogs. The second is that those fossils tend to show up more and more with people. Most people used to think that relationship was just for hunting. But many experts now recognize it’s a kind of companionship, a sharing of the world.Anyone who argues that the human record supports one single way of humans having sex, getting together, or raising families, is wrong. Humans are more monogamous, that is they spend a lot of investment in these pair bonds, than most other mammals. But this idea that monogamy is who we are, and how we explain humanity, is not only blind to the data, but also not true in almost everyone’s life if they look around and are honest with themselves.The evolutionary record also shows us clearly that the raising of young is more than a two-individual undertaking. The work of Sarah Hrdy and many others is fantastic in showing us that one of the kick-starts to the human capacity to succeed was intensive co-parenting or “mothers and others.” I don’t just mean Mom and Dad but, in fact, parenting by grandmas, grandpas, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters, cousins, nieces and nephews.Kyrgyz grandparents ride the train with their grandson. "It is absolutely clear," says Fuentes, "that the human success story is part and parcel of our incredible ability to 'take a whole village' to raise a child."To grow the kind of baby that we do, with this giant brain, who can’t do anything for the first 3-5 years of life, you need a lot of input. As much as 1.5-1.7 million years ago, we start to see a shift in the fossils, which suggests that more than one or two individuals became closely involved in taking care of the young. Fast forward to the last couple hundred thousand years, and it is absolutely clear that the human success story is part and parcel of our incredible ability to “take a whole village” to raise a child, as the old saying goes. The nuclear family—Mom, Dad, a couple kids, and a dog—is not only very recent but is not even typical of the way most people live in the world. This whole notion of a family house with a white picket fence is a very a-typical way to be human.The idea of gender is this complex way in which humans interpret and think about the role of the sexes in society. That can be used in multiple ways. It can be beneficial and open. It can also be used to restrict people. In the U.S. right now we’re seeing an attack on equality and freedoms. That’s a very important way that gender can be manipulated. Gender is created because we invented it.Race is another thing. Humans vary all over the planet and that’s fascinating and important. But labels like black, white, Asian, Latino are social constructs that can be used to enforce inequality, violence, and oppression. When we do that we’re seeing the really negative side of our ability to create things in the world and make them a reality.Nationality is another perfect example. In the U.S. and Europe right now, we’re reverting to a new tribalism, this sense of, “I am THIS nation and you are THAT nation,” and flaring up again the exact kinds of conflicts and problems that led to massive wars in the last century.Do some art! Every kid does art and then we stop doing it as adults because we think it’s a waste of time. But doing art is flexing our creative muscle and it’s really important.They second thing is: Make a meal. Gather some ingredients, some friends or family, and cook something. Demonstrate this incredible, multi-million-year-old capacity to take nutrition and make it amazing, imaginative, and tasty!Another thing is to just reflect. Look back at your week at how many times you and others around you helped each other out, collaborated, or coordinated in some way. Even the act of getting in a line to wait for a movie or a supermarket checkout is absolutely incredible.Finally, people need to not let the 24/7 news cycle get them down. There are a lot of major problems in the world, but the news is selling you fear, terror, and violence. They very rarely report on positive things. If you step back from the news and look at what’s going on in your life and the lives around you, hang out with friends or a dog, and check out the amazing human capacity to collaborate and create, the world might seem like a slightly better place, and you will have a more realistic take on what the world actually is.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk.

"How many animals of each kind did Moses put on the ark?If you answered two, then congratulations: You’re wrong. It wasn’t Moses who put animals on the ark; it was Noah. As science has it, this question and others like it illustrate more than just a person’s general confusion between two historic religious figures.“It gets at the extent to which people rely on intuitive answers that pop to their mind as opposed to reflecting and checking whether the answer that comes to mind is right or wrong,” says Steve Sloman, a professor of cognitive science at Brown University and editor-in-chief of the journal Cognition.And in a world where misleading news stories are the new norm, the Moses ark question is a good predictor of whether people are susceptible to fake news. Such is the illusion of explanatory depth, or our tendency to overestimate our understanding of how something works.It is rooted in our tendency—or lack thereof—to reflect and to double check, Sloman says.“The trick with fake news is to know to verify, and if you’re reflective then you’re more likely to engage in that process of verification,” Sloman adds.But it’s not always easy to discern factually inaccurate news stories, and we can thank human nature for our propensity to accept what we read without much question or reflection.In a recent article for The New Yorker, journalist Elizabeth Kolbert reviews several studies on the human mind’s limitations of reason, starting with groundbreaking work at Stanford 50 years ago.“Coming from a group of academics in the nineteen-seventies, the contention that people can’t think straight was shocking,” Kolbert writes. “It isn’t any longer. Thousands of subsequent experiments have confirmed (and elaborated on) this finding.”There are a number of ways in which reason fails us, leaving us vulnerable to factually incorrect news stories that spread like viruses and infect understanding of what’s real and what’s not. One of the relevant psychological concepts is “motivated reasoning,” writes Adam Waytz, an associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern’s Kellogg School.Motivated reasoning is the idea that we are motivated to believe whatever confirms our opinions.“If you’re motivated to believe negative things about Hillary Clinton [or Donald Trump], you’re more likely to trust outrageous stories about her that might not be true,” Waytz says. “Over time, motivated reasoning can lead to a false social consensus.”Another related concept is “naïve realism,” or the idea that our views are the only ones that are accurate. Such a notion contributes to polarization in political discussions; instead of disagreeing with people, Waytz says, we often dismiss their views as incorrect.“We’re all quick to believe what we’re motivated to believe, and we call too many things ‘fake news’ simply because it doesn’t support our own view of reality,” he notes.Sloman’s research focuses on the idea that knowledge is contagious. Hence his book title: The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone.Sloman recently published a paper called “Your Understanding Is My Understanding” in the journal Psychological Science with Brown undergraduate Nathaniel Rabb. In the web-based experiment, which examined more than 700 volunteers, Brown and Rabb made up a phenomena in which scientists supposedly discovered a system of helium rain.In one situation, they told the volunteers that the scientists do not fully understand the phenomena and cannot fully explain it, before asking the volunteers to rate their own understanding of helium rain on a scale of one to seven, with one being the lowest. Most of the volunteers rated their answers at one, admitting they don’t understand the concept.However, in the second instance, Sloman and his partner told the volunteers that the scientists understand helium rain and can fully explain how it works. When asked to rate their own understanding, this group of volunteers submitted answers that averaged around two. The fact that the scientists understand gave the volunteers an increased sense of understanding, Sloman says.The idea can easily be translated into politics.“It’s like understanding is contagious,” Sloman says. “If everyone around you is saying they understand why a politician is crooked, they saw a video [about that person] on YouTube...then you’re going to start thinking that you understand, too.”With all this research shedding light on what makes us so susceptible to fake news, is there a way we can protect ourselves against it?“I don’t think it’s possible to train individuals to verify everything that they encounter,” Sloman says. “It is just too human to believe what you’re told and move on.”However, Sloman says he sees the potential in training a community to care about verification. Think of the headlines and stories that are shared on your Facebook feed every day that, most likely, align with your world view. We as a community should consider lowering the bar on what should be double-checked, Sloman says.All it takes is one person to comment that something doesn’t add up.“Develop a norm in your community that says, ‘We should check things and not just take them at face value,’” Sloman says. “Verify before you believe.”",
"Students cheer at the March for Our Lives rally, held on Saturday in Washington, D.C., to protest gun violence after recent school shootings."Now we fight for our lives."That is the call to action urged by the March For Our Lives website following a rally that drew hundreds of thousands to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., this Saturday to protest gun violence. Sister marches took place not only across the country, but around the world—adding up to 846 events globally, with one even held in Antarctica.No matter the location, the unifying message of these protests was clear: Enough is enough. Many of those who carried signs or spoke at the rally demanded tougher gun-control laws, including banning the sale of assault weapons and closing loopholes on background checks.A New Class of LeadersIt has taken only 38 days for the surviving students of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to ignite a nationwide movement toward gun reform.Many of the school's students spoke at the main March For Our Lives event in Washington, D.C. Senior Emma Gonzalez asked the crowd to “fight for your lives before it’s someone else’s job.”Perhaps the most moving part of Gonzalez’s speech, though, was silence. She allotted herself six minutes and 20 seconds for her speech—the amount of time, she said, that it had taken Nikolas Cruz to kill 17 in Parkland and injure many more.A surprise appearance was also made by Yolanda Renee King, the 9-year-old granddaughter of the revolutionary Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King—and she has a dream of her own. “I have a dream that enough is enough," she said. "That this should be a gun-free world. Period.”The young, determined voices didn't stop at the stage. Children and teens of all ages showed up with signs in tow. One fourth-grade girl who came with fellow students from Francis Scott Key Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia, held a sign that read: "We may be small but we have a voice!"Volunteers could also be seen throughout the throngs of crowds calling for people to register to vote. Stickers adorning protestors’ jackets and signs counted down the days until U.S. midterm elections, which will take place in eight months on November 6. The elections are seen as a chance to bring in more members of Congress as well as state and local officials who support gun-control measures.",
"By headcount, the North Korean military is one of the largest in the world. And much of its power relies on how it is seen. National Geographic's David Guttenfelder has the rare credentials of being a western photographer allowed inside the so-called Hermit Kingdom. His mobility in the country is often restricted, but not as much as you’d think, especially when it comes to the military.“You see them everywhere, they’re not just the country’s defense, they’re part of North Korea’s entire identity,” he says. Soldiers do development projects, they build infrastructure, and they keep life in Pyongyang running smoothly under the country’s regime. Guttenfelder’s access also included invitations to the annual Mass Games performance and the highly choreographed military demonstrations of goose-stepping soldiers and artillery on parade. Everyone at the event has a role to play, including the spectators, who use color flip-books to make grand mosaics from the stands. The images are usually tributes to the country’s leaders, or simply, the military at large.",
"October 1, 2017, Las Vegas, Nevada | 58 killed, 546 injuredFiring from the 32nd floor of a hotel, a man armed with semiautomatic rifles, modified to fire faster, rained more than a thousand rounds on a music festival.

On the first anniversary, mourners returned to the scene.From the kitchen window of her mobile home in Auburn, Illinois, Ashley Aldridge had a clear view of the railroad crossing about a hundred yards away.When the 19-year-old mother first saw the man in the wheelchair, she had just finished feeding lunch to her two children, ages one and three, and had moved on to washing dishes—one more in an endless string of chores. Looking up, Aldridge noticed that the wheelchair wasn’t moving. It was stuck between the tracks. The man was yelling for help as a motorcycle and two cars went by without stopping.Facing down fear to help: A young mother of two, Aldridge ran barefoot to a railroad crossing to rescue a man whose wheelchair was stuck on the tracks. She yanked him free just before a train would have hit them. “I don’t really think of myself as a hero, but my kids tell me all the time that I am,” she says. “I was just helping somebody, I guess is how I see it, because if that was my grandpa, I would hope somebody would help him too.”Aldridge hurried out to ask a neighbor to watch her kids so she could go help. Then she heard the train horn and the clanging of the crossing gate as it came down, signaling that a train was on its way. She ran, barefoot, over a gravel path along the tracks. When she got to the man, the train was less than half a mile away, bearing down at about 80 miles an hour. Failing to dislodge the wheelchair, she wrapped her arms around the man’s chest from behind and tried to lift him, but couldn’t. As the train barreled toward them, she pulled with a mighty heave. She fell backward, yanking him out of the chair. Within seconds, the train smashed the wheelchair, carrying fragments of steel and plastic half a mile up the track.The man Aldridge saved that afternoon in September 2015 was a complete stranger. Her unflinching determination to save him despite the threat to her own life sets her apart from many. Aldridge’s heroic rescue is an example of what scientists call extreme altruism—selfless acts to help those unrelated to oneself at the risk of grave personal harm. Not surprisingly, many of these heroes—such as Roi Klein, an Israeli army major who jumped on a live grenade to save his men—work in professions in which endangering one’s life to protect others is part of the job. But others are ordinary men and women—like Rick Best, Taliesin Namkai-Meche, and Micah Fletcher, who intervened to defend two young women, one wearing a hijab, from a man spewing anti-Muslim abuse at them on a commuter train in Portland, Oregon. All three were stabbed; only Fletcher survived.Intervening to help strangers: Fletcher and two other men defended two women—one wearing a hijab—from a man spewing anti-Muslim abuse on a Portland commuter train. The assailant stabbed all three men. Two died, and Fletcher suffered a deep neck wound. He said he instinctively stepped in to help the women. Diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum as a child, he was bullied and beaten. “If you are truly a community, then everybody should be expected to stand up for one another,” he says.Contrast these noble acts with the horrors that humans commit: murder, rape, kidnapping, torture. Consider the carnage perpetrated by the man who sprayed bullets from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, in October at a country music festival. Three weeks later, officials put the casualty toll at 58 dead and 546 wounded. Or think about the chilling ruthlessness of a serial killer like Todd Kohlhepp, a real estate agent in South Carolina, who appears to have left clues about his murderous habit in bizarre online reviews for products, including a folding shovel: “Keep in car for when you have to hide the bodies.” In spite of how aberrant these horrors are, they occur often enough to remind us of a dark truth: Humans are capable of unspeakable cruelty.Extreme altruists and psychopaths exemplify our best and worst instincts. On one end of the moral spectrum, sacrifice, generosity, and other ennobling traits that we recognize as good; on the other end, selfishness, violence, and destructive impulses that we see as evil. At the root of both types of behaviors, researchers say, is our evolutionary past. They hypothesize that humans—and many other species, to a lesser degree—evolved the desire to help one another because cooperation within large social groups was essential to survival. But because groups had to compete for resources, the willingness to maim and possibly kill opponents was also crucial. “We are the most social species on Earth, and we are also the most violent species on Earth,” says Jean Decety, a social neurologist at the University of Chicago. “We have two faces because these two faces were important to survival.”For centuries the question of how good and evil originate and manifest in us was a matter of philosophical or religious debate. But in recent decades researchers have made significant advances toward understanding the science of what drives good and evil. Both seem to be linked to a key emotional trait: empathy, which is an intrinsic ability of the brain to experience how another person is feeling. Researchers have found that empathy is the kindling that fires compassion in our hearts, impelling us to help others in distress. Studies also have traced violent, psychopathic, and antisocial behaviors to a lack of empathy, which appears to stem from impaired neural circuits. These new insights are laying the foundation for training regimens and treatment programs that aim to enhance the brain’s empathic response.Learning how the brain works: A railroad construction foreman, Gage (top) survived an explosion in 1848 that drove an iron rod through his left frontal lobe. When he recovered, he was no longer friendly and respectful; he was uncaring and indifferent. A patient in Canada underwent a similar change when a benign tumor grew in his frontal lobe. After it was removed in 2016, his wife told the Sherbrooke University medical team, “Thank you for giving me back my husband.” His MRI scans (above) show before and after surgery. Cases like these help explain how brain structures guide social and moral behavior.Researchers once thought young children had no concern for the well-being of others—a logical conclusion if you’ve seen a toddler’s tantrums. But recent findings show that babies feel empathy long before their first birthday. Maayan Davidov, a psychologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and her colleagues have conducted some of these studies, analyzing the behavior of children as they witness somebody in distress—a crying child, an experimenter, or their own mother pretending to be hurt. Even before six months of age, many infants respond to such stimuli with facial expressions reflecting concern; some also exhibit caring gestures such as leaning forward and trying to communicate with the one in distress. In their first year, infants also show signs of trying to understand the suffering they’re seeing. Eighteen-month-olds often translate their empathy into such positive social behavior as giving a hug or a toy to comfort a hurt child.That’s not true of all children, however. In a small minority, starting in the second year of life, researchers see what they call an “active disregard” of others. “When someone reported that someone had hurt themselves,” says Carolyn Zahn-Waxler, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, “these children would kind of laugh at them or even kind of swipe at them and say, ‘You’re not hurt,’ or ‘You should be more careful’—saying it in a tone of voice that was judgmental.” Following these toddlers into adolescence, Zahn-Waxler and her colleague Soo Hyun Rhee, a psychologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, found they had a high likelihood of developing antisocial tendencies and getting into trouble.Other studies have measured callousness and lack of emotional expression in adolescents using questions such as whether the subject feels remorseful upon doing something wrong. Those with high scores for “callous-unemotional” traits tend to have frequent and severe behavioral problems—showing extreme aggression in fights, for instance, or vandalizing property. Researchers have also found that some of these adolescents end up committing major crimes such as murder, rape, and violent robbery. Some are prone to becoming full-blown psychopaths as adults—individuals with cold, calculating hearts who wouldn’t flinch while perpetrating the most horrific acts imaginable. (Most psychopaths are men.)If the empathy deficit at the core of psychopathic behaviors can be traced all the way back to toddlerhood, does evil reside in the genes, coiled up like a serpent in the DNA, waiting to strike? The answer isn’t a categorical yes or no. As it is with many illnesses, both nature and nurture have a hand. Studies of twins have established that callous-unemotional traits displayed by some young children and adolescents arise to a substantial degree from genes they inherit. Yet in a study of 561 children born to mothers with a history of antisocial behaviors, researchers found that those living with adoptive families that provided a warm and nurturing environment were far less likely to exhibit callous-unemotional traits than those with adoptive families that were not as nurturing.Children born with genes making it more likely that they will have difficulty empathizing are often unable to get a break. “You can imagine that if you have a child who doesn’t show affection in the same way as a typically developing child, doesn’t show empathy, that child will evoke very different reactions in the people around them—the parents, the teachers, the peers—than a child who’s more amenable, more empathetic,” says Essi Viding, a research psychologist at University College London. “And many of these children, of course, reside within their biological families, so they often have this double whammy of having parents who are perhaps less well equipped for many of the parenting tasks, are less good at empathizing, less good at regulating their own emotions.”The firefighters tried desperately to save the six Philpott children from their burning house in Derby, England, in the early hours of May 11, 2012. But the heat and smoke were so intense that only one of the kids was alive when rescuers finally made their way upstairs where they had been sleeping. That boy, too, perished two days later in the hospital. The police suspected arson, based on evidence that the fire had been started by pouring gasoline through the door’s mail slot.Derby residents raised money to help the children’s parents—Mick and Mairead Philpott—pay for a funeral. At a news conference to thank the community, Philpott was sobbing and dabbing his eyes with a tissue that remained curiously dry. Leaving the event, he collapsed, but Derbyshire’s assistant chief constable, walking behind, was struck by the unnaturalness of the behavior. Eighteen days later, the police arrested Philpott and his wife. Investigators determined that they had set fire to the house with an accomplice to frame Mick’s mistress. A court found all three guilty of manslaughter.Scanning to understand psychopaths: A neuroscientist at the University of New Mexico, Kiehl has found striking abnormalities in the brains of psychopaths. He has scanned more than 4,000 inmates, measuring the activity in their brains as well as the size of different brain regions. He says psychopaths have impairments in the interconnected brain structures that help process emotions, make decisions, control impulses, and set goals.Trying to mold the mind to do right: At this facility in Wisconsin for violent teen offenders, a program is helping to keep many from hardening into lifelong criminals. Based on their behavior each day, youths can earn or lose privileges for the next day, such as being allowed to play video games. This approach allows them to redeem themselves every 24 hours. Here a boy holds a graph of his average weekly points for a year.Philpott’s faking of grief and his lack of remorse are among the characteristics that define psychopaths, a category of individuals who have come to embody evil in the popular imagination. Psychopaths have utter disregard for the feelings of others, although they seem to learn to mimic emotions. “They really just have a complete inability to appreciate anything like empathy or guilt or remorse,” says Kent Kiehl, a neuroscientist at the Mind Research Network and the University of New Mexico who was drawn to studying psychopathy in part because he grew up in a neighborhood that was once home to the serial killer Ted Bundy. These are people who are “just extremely different than the rest of us.”Kiehl has spent the past two decades exploring this difference by scanning the brains of prison inmates. (Nearly one in every five adult males in prison in the U.S. and Canada scores high in psychopathy, measured using a checklist of 20 criteria such as impulsivity and lack of remorse, compared with one out of every 150 in the general male population.)Using an MRI scanner installed inside a tractor trailer, Kiehl and his colleagues have imaged more than 4,000 prison inmates since 2007, measuring the activity in their brains as well as the size of different brain regions.Psychopathic criminals show reduced activity in their brain’s amygdala, a primary site of emotional processing, compared with non-psychopathic inmates when recalling emotionally charged words they were shown moments earlier, such as “misery” and “frown.” In a task designed to test moral decision-making, researchers ask inmates to rate the offensiveness of pictures flashed on a screen, such as a cross burning by the Ku Klux Klan or a face bloodied by a beating. Although the ratings by psychopathic offenders aren’t that different from those by non-psychopaths—they both recognize the moral violation in the pictures—psychopaths tend to show weaker activation in brain regions instrumental in moral reasoning.Based on these and other, similar findings, Kiehl is convinced that psychopaths have impairments in a system of interconnected brain structures—including the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex—that help process emotions, make decisions, control impulses, and set goals. There is “basically about 5 to 7 percent less gray matter in those structures in individuals with high psychopathic traits compared to other inmates,” Kiehl says. The psychopath appears to compensate for this deficiency by using other parts of the brain to cognitively simulate what really belongs in the realm of emotion. “That is, the psychopath must think about right and wrong while the rest of us feel it,” Kiehl wrote in a paper he co-authored in 2011.When Abigail Marsh, a psychologist at Georgetown University, was 19, her car skidded on a bridge after she swerved to avoid hitting a dog. The vehicle spun out of control and finally came to a stop in the fast lane, facing oncoming traffic. Marsh couldn’t get the engine to start and was too afraid to get out, with cars and trucks rushing past the vehicle. A man pulled over, ran across the highway, and helped start the car. “He took an enormous risk running across the freeway. There’s no possible explanation for it other than he just wanted to help,” Marsh says. “How can anybody be moved to do something like that?”Marsh kept turning that question over in her head. Not long after she began working at Georgetown, she wondered if the altruism shown by the driver on the bridge wasn’t in some ways the polar opposite of psychopathy. She began looking for a group of exceptionally kind individuals to study and decided that altruistic kidney donors would make ideal subjects. These are people who’ve chosen to donate a kidney to a stranger, sometimes even incurring financial costs, yet receive no compensation in return.Marsh and her colleagues brought 19 donors in from around the country for the study. The researchers showed each one a series of black-and-white photographs of facial expressions, some fearful, some angry, and others neutral, while their brains were scanned using an MRI machine to map both activity and structure.Guiding others to safety: When Chavez (above) saw a woman next to him covered in blood at a Las Vegas music festival, he realized he and his girlfriend, Deianara Torres (at right), were under fire. He helped her escape to safety over a crowd barrier near the stage, then saw another concertgoer they’d met earlier. “We locked eyes, and it was complete fear,” he says. “I knew I had to stay there and help her.” He aided her and several others paralyzed by shock, boosting them over the fence.Getting in harm’s way: On his way to his job washing boats, Ramirez (above) rescued a Miami police officer from a barrage of bullets fired by a man with an assault rifle. He drove his van in between the officer and the shooter, opened a door so the officer could jump in, and sped away to safety. “I could not just go by, go to work without doing anything. The police risk their lives for people all the time,” he told the Sun Sentinel newspaper.When looking at fearful faces, donors showed a greater response in their right amygdala than a control group. Separately, the researchers found that their right amygdalas were, on average, 8 percent larger than those of the control group. Similar studies done previously on psychopathic subjects had found the opposite: The amygdalas in psychopathic brains are smaller and activated less than those in controls while reacting to frightened faces.“Fearful expressions elicit concern and caring. If you’re not responsive to that expression, you’re unlikely to experience concern for other people,” Marsh explains. “And altruistic kidney donors just seem to be very sensitive to other people’s distress, with fear being the most acute kind of distress—maybe in part because their amygdalas are larger than average.”The majority of people in the world are neither extreme altruists nor psychopaths, and most individuals in any society do not ordinarily commit violent acts against one another. And yet, there are genocides—organized mass killings that require the complicity and passivity of large numbers of people. Time and again, social groups organized along ethnic, national, racial, and religious lines have savaged other groups. Nazi Germany’s gas chambers extinguished millions of Jews, the Communist Khmer Rouge slaughtered fellow Cambodians in the killing fields, Hutu extremists in Rwanda wielding machetes slaughtered several hundred thousand Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and Islamic State terrorists massacred Iraq’s Yazidis—virtually every part of the world appears to have suffered through a genocide. Events such as these provide ghastly evidence that evil can hold entire communities in its grip.How the voice of conscience is rendered inconsequential to foot soldiers of a genocide can be partly understood through the prism of the well-known experiments conducted in the 1960s by the psychologist Stanley Milgram at Yale University. In those studies, subjects were asked to deliver electric shocks to a person in another room for failing to answer questions correctly, increasing the voltage with every wrong answer. At the prodding of a person in a lab coat who played the role of an experimenter, the subjects often dialed up the shocks to dangerously high voltage levels. The shocks weren’t real and the cries of pain heard by the subjects were prerecorded, but the subjects only found that out afterward. The studies demonstrated what Milgram described as “the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority.”Gregory Stanton, a former U.S. State Department official and founder of Genocide Watch, a nonprofit that works to prevent mass murder, has identified the stages that can cause otherwise decent people to commit murder. It starts when demagogic leaders define a target group as “the other” and claim it is a threat to the interests of supporters. Discrimination follows, and soon the leaders characterize their targets as subhuman, eroding the in-group’s empathy for “the other.”Next, society becomes polarized. “Those planning the genocide say, ‘You are either with us or against us,’ ” says Stanton. This is followed by a phase of preparation, with the architects of the genocide drawing up death lists, stocking weapons, and planning how the rank and file are to execute the killings. Members of the out-group are sometimes forced to move into ghettos or concentration camps. Then the massacres begin.Many of the perpetrators remain untouched by remorse, not because they are incapable of feeling it—as is the case with psychopathic killers—but because they find ways to rationalize the killings. James Waller, a genocide scholar at Keene State College in New Hampshire, says he got a glimpse of this “incredible capacity of the human mind to make sense of and to justify the worst of actions” when he interviewed dozens of Hutu men convicted or accused of committing atrocities during the Rwandan genocide. Some of them had hacked children, even those they personally knew, to death. Their rationale, according to Waller, was: “If I didn’t do this, those children would have grown up to come back to kill me. This was something that was a necessity for my people to be safe, for my people to survive.”Our capacity to empathize and channel that into compassion may be innate, but it is not immutable. Neither is the tendency to develop psychopathic and antisocial personalities so fixed in childhood as to be unchangeable. In recent years researchers have shown the feasibility of nipping evil in the bud as well as strengthening our positive social instincts.The possibility of preventing violent teenage boys from hardening into lifelong criminals has been put to the test at the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center in Wisconsin, a facility that houses serious offenders but is run more as a psychiatric unit than as a prison. The adolescents referred to the center come in with already long criminal histories—teenagers who are a threat to others. “These are folks who essentially have dropped out of the human race—they don’t have any connection to anyone, and they are in a real antagonistic posture with everybody,” says Michael Caldwell, a senior staff psychologist.The center attempts to build a connection with the kids despite their aggressive and antisocial behaviors. Even when an inmate hurls feces or sprays urine at staff members—a common occurrence at many correctional institutions—the staff members keep treating the offender humanely. The kids are scored on a set of behavior rating scales every day. If they do well, they earn certain privileges the following day, such as a chance to play video games. If they score badly, say, by getting into a fight, they lose privileges. The focus is not on punishing bad behavior but on rewarding good conduct. That’s different from most correctional institutions. Over time the kids start to behave better, says Greg Van Rybroek, the center’s director. Their callous-unemotional traits diminish. Their improved ability to manage their emotions and control their violent impulses seems to endure beyond the walls of Mendota. Adolescents treated in the program have committed far fewer and less violent offenses between two and six years after release than those treated elsewhere, the center’s studies have found. “We don’t have any magic,” Van Rybroek says, “but we’ve actually created a system that considers the world from the youth’s point of view and tries to break it down in a fair and consistent manner.”During the past decade researchers have discovered that our social brain is plastic, even in adulthood, and that we can be trained to be more kind and generous. Tania Singer, a social neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, has pioneered studies demonstrating this.Sharing sorrow: Klebold (at left) is the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of two teenagers who carried out the 1999 shooting at Colorado’s Columbine High School. Klebold wrote about her experience in A Mother’s Reckoning and donates any profits to mental health charities. She has become a mother figure to Sanders (at right), whose father was killed in the massacre. For years Sanders was angry with Klebold for raising a son who became a killer. But her struggle to raise her own teenagers helped her understand Klebold. “If anyone’s pain is greater than my own, it’s hers,” she says. The women, here at a memorial for the victims in Olinger Chapel Hill cemetery, now share a strong bond.Empathy and compassion use different networks in the brain, Singer and her colleagues found. Both can lead to positive social behavior, but the brain’s empathic response to seeing another person suffer can sometimes lead to empathic distress—a negative reaction that makes the onlooker want to turn away from the sufferer to preserve his or her own sense of well-being.To enhance compassion, which combines awareness of another’s distress with the desire to alleviate it, Singer and her colleagues have tested the effects of various training exercises. A prominent exercise, derived from Buddhist traditions, involves having subjects meditate on a loved one—a parent or a child, for example—directing warmth and kindness toward that individual and gradually extending those same feelings toward acquaintances, strangers, and even enemies, in an ever widening circle of love. Singer’s group has shown that subjects who trained in this form of loving-kindness meditation even for a few days had a more compassionate response—as measured by the activation of certain brain circuits—than untrained subjects, when watching short film clips of people suffering emotional distress.In another study, Singer and her colleagues tested the effects of compassion training on helpfulness by using a computer game in which subjects guide a virtual character on a computer screen through a maze to a treasure chest, opening gates along the way. They can also choose to open gates for another character wandering about, looking for treasure. The researchers found that subjects who underwent compassion training were more helpful than those in a control group toward the other character—the equivalent of a stranger.That we might be able to mold our brains to be more altruistic is an ennobling prospect for society. One way to bring that future closer, Singer believes, would be to include compassion training in schools. The result could be a more benevolent world, populated by people like Ashley Aldridge, in which reflexive kindness loses its extraordinariness and becomes a defining trait of humanity.",
"On February 6, SpaceX made history with the largely successful first launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket—and National Geographic was there, right alongside SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.In preparation for the second season of MARS, which is returning to Nat Geo this fall, a camera crew followed Musk and his team on the day of the launch, capturing their reactions as the rocket rumbled to life.“Holy flying f--k, that thing took off,” Musk exclaimed. Moments later, he and SpaceX staffers ran out the door of the launch control center and turned their gazes upward. “Look at that! That's unreal!” Musk cried out.As National Geographic reported from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday, the Falcon Heavy launch is a milestone for private companies' journey into space. At peak performance, the massive rocket can lift 141,000 pounds—equal to the weight of two adult sperm whales—into low-Earth orbit. Only NASA's Saturn V rocket, which carried astronauts to the moon, has lifted more that high.But as Musk emphasized before and after the launch, success was hardly a given.SpaceX announced its intention to build the Falcon Heavy in 2011, crafting it as a vehicle essentially made out of three combined Falcon 9s, the company's currently most-used rocket. At the time, Musk thought that the Falcon Heavy would launch in 2013, but the project promptly entered years of development hell. To make the Falcon Heavy work, SpaceX had to redesign the center booster completely, rework the control systems, and upgrade the fins that the reusable first stages use to steer so they can land back on Earth.“We tried to cancel the Falcon Heavy program three times at SpaceX, because it [was] way harder than we thought," said Musk in a press briefing after the launch.Now that the Falcon Heavy has flown, more work remains to refine the rocket and develop its successor, the so-called BFR booster and spaceship that he hopes will one day be bound for Mars. But above all, Musk's takeaway from the test flight was that he and his roughly 7,000 employees had pulled off something extraordinary.“Crazy things can come true,” he said. “When I see a rocket lift off, I see a thousand things that could not work, and it's amazing when they do.”",
"Smoke billows from a large steel plant in China. The World Health Organization estimates nine in 10 people around the world breath bad air.Breathing in dirty air damages our lungs, but new research is showing it might change how we think, too.  A study published earlier this week in the Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences found that long-term exposure to particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide led to cognitive declines in study participants as they aged. Less-educated men were particularly impacted and had low verbal and math test scores.Scientists and health officials are still working to discern exactly how air pollutants interact with the brain.“We speculate that air pollution probably puts greater damage on the white matter in the brain, which is associated with language ability,” says Xin Zhang, a study author and researcher at Beijing Normal University's school of statistics.Previous studies have found that female brains on average have more white matter than male brains, meaning damage to white matter would put males, with lesser white matter, more at risk of experiencing cognitive declines.“More research is needed to understand the mechanisms,” notes Zhang.While the Chinese study highlights an important link, it will need to be replicated to quantify how air pollution changes the brain, says Jonathan Samet, dean of the Colorado School of Public Health. Only in the past decade has research on air pollution and brain health intensified, he says, noting that how particles enter and coat the lungs is better understood.“The lungs are the portal of entry,” says Samet. “The area of the lungs is the size of the tennis court, so there's a huge surface to hit. We breathe in 10,000 liters [of air] a day.”Like Zhang, Samet says that more research needs to be done to understand the exact mechanisms of how pollution particles enter the brain, what functions they impact, and how long they last once there.“They could move along the olfactory nerves from the nose to the brain, or they get into the blood,” says Samet. He suspects that damage could also be caused by inflammation.In addition to the lungs and the brain, studies have also linked air pollution with poor heart health and diabetes.“It's surprising how many organs seem to be affected,” Samet adds.As environmental toxicologist Dan Costa from the University of North Carolina explains, that’s because the human body's internal makeup is highly interconnected. Air pollution has been shown to minimally impact not just the lungs, but the heart, brain, and reproductive system.“When something comes in [to the body] that's potentially toxic, it's implications are everywhere,” he says. His suspects that pollutants reach the brain through the blood stream.All of the blood that leaves the lungs goes through the heart, where it's then pumped out to the rest of the body. Costa suspects this triggers the immune system, causing inflammation. Over time, he says, too many toxic particles could cause too much inflammation, which may accelerate how quickly the brain ages.The brain is a difficult organ to study, notes Costa. And this relatively new research frontier is made more difficult because of the numerous variables that can alter brain chemistry.“The brain has such a complex network of processes,” Costa adds. “It has a higher level of functionality that the other organs don't.”People today live longer than they did 70 years ago, when black soot was pumped into the atmosphere. Costa says this could at least partially account for why doctors are just now seeing all the ways air pollution permeates through the body.“We didn't appreciate the subtleties that are emerging now,” he adds.Costa, who until recently worked at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, says particulate matter, which is generated by anything from wildfires to fossil fuel combustion, is largely thought to be the air pollutant most dangerous to health. But pinpointing the impacts of any one particle can be difficult because regions with poor air quality often have more than one type of pollutant.In the past two decades, EPA data shows the three pollutants identified in the Beijing study have all decreased in the U.S. They remain, however, in developing regions with large urban industrial centers.In a report published this year, the World Health Organization published a report finding nine in 10 people globally breath bad air. In the U.S., the American Lung Association puts that number at four in 10.“We're getting to the point where a lot of easy wins have been done,” says Samet. Coal burning power plants and diesel generators remain some of the most dangerous source of air pollution.Samet suspects that tackling other forms of air pollution will require a change in mindset in the form of improved public transportation or better city planning.",
"Electrodes measure a Tibetan monk's brain activity.The ancient Egyptians thought so little of brain matter they made a practice of scooping it out through the nose of a dead leader before packing the skull with cloth before burial. They believed consciousness resided in the heart, a view shared by Aristotle and a legacy of medieval thinkers. Even when consensus for the locus of thought moved northward into the head, it was not the brain that was believed to be the sine qua non, but the empty spaces within it, called ventricles, where ephemeral spirits swirled about. As late as 1662, philosopher Henry More scoffed that the brain showed "no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet, or a bowl of curds."Around the same time, French philosopher René Descartes codified the separation of conscious thought from the physical flesh of the brain. Cartesian "dualism" exerted a powerful influence over Western science for centuries, and while dismissed by most neuroscientists today, still feeds the popular belief in mind as a magical, transcendent quality.A contemporary of Descartes named Thomas Willis—often referred to as the father of neurology—was the first to suggest that not only was the brain itself the locus of the mind, but that different parts of the brain give rise to specific cognitive functions. Early 19th-century phrenologists pushed this notion in a quaint direction, proposing that personality proclivities could be deduced by feeling the bumps on a person's skull, which were caused by the brain "pushing out" in places where it was particularly well developed. Plaster casts of the heads of executed criminals were examined and compared to a reference head to determine whether any particular protuberances could be reliably associated with criminal behavior.Though absurdly unscientific even for its time, phrenology was remarkably prescient—up to a point. In the past decade especially, advanced technologies for capturing a snapshot of the brain in action have confirmed that discrete functions occur in specific locations. The neural "address" where you remember a phone number, for instance, is different from the one where you remember a face, and recalling a famous face involves different circuits than remembering your best friend's.Yet it is increasingly clear that cognitive functions cannot be pinned to spots on the brain like towns on a map. A given mental task may involve a complicated web of circuits, which interact in varying degrees with others throughout the brain—not like the parts in a machine, but like the instruments in a symphony orchestra combining their tenor, volume, and resonance to create a particular musical effect.Corina's brain all she is…is hereCorina Alamillo is lying on her right side in an operating room in the UCLA Medical Center. There is a pillow tucked beneath her cheek and a steel scaffold screwed into her forehead to keep her head perfectly still. A medical assistant in her late 20s, she has dark brown eyes, full eyebrows, and a round, open face.On the other side of a tent of sterile blue paper, two surgeons are hard at work on a saucer-size portion of Corina's brain, which gleams like mother-of-pearl and pulsates gently to the rhythm of her heartbeat. On the brain's surface a filigree of arteries feeds blood to the region under the surgeons' urgent scrutiny: a part of her left frontal lobe critical to the production of spoken language. Nearby, the dark, dull edge of a tumor threatens like an approaching squall. The surgeons need to remove the tumor without taking away Corina's ability to speak along with it. To do that, they need her to be conscious and responsive through the beginning of the operation process. They anesthetized her to remove a piece of her scalp and skull and fold back a protective membrane underneath. Now they can touch her brain, which has no pain receptors."Wake up, Sweetie," says another doctor, sitting in a chair under the paper tent with Corina. "Everything is going fine. Can you say something for me?" Corina's lips move as she tries to answer through the clearing fog of anesthesia."Hi," she whispers.The deep red hue of Corina's tumor is plain to see, even to a layperson leaning over the surgeon's shoulder. So is the surrounding tissue of her brain, a three-pound (1.4-kilogram), helmet-shaped bolus of fat and protein, wrinkled like a cleaning sponge and with a consistency of curdled milk.Corina's brain is the most beautiful object that exists, even more beautiful than Corina herself, for it allows her to perceive beauty, have a self, and know about existence in the first place. But how does mere matter like this make a mind? How does this mound of meat bring into being her comprehension of the doctor's question, and her ability to respond to it? Through what sublime process does electrochemical energy become her hope that the operation will go well, or her fear for her two children if it should not? How does it bring into being her memory of clutching tight to her mother's hand in the hospital room half an hour ago—or 20 years before in a store parking lot? These are hardly new questions. In the past few years, however, powerful new techniques for visualizing the sources of thought, emotion, and behavior are revolutionizing the way we understand the nature of the brain and the mind it creates.The opening in Corina's skull provides a glimpse into the history of the mind's attempt to understand its physical being. The patch of frontal lobe adjacent to her tumor is called Broca's area, named after the 19th-century French anatomist Paul Broca, one of the first scientists to offer definitive evidence that—while there is no single seat of thought—specific cognitive traits and functions are processed in localized regions of the brain.Broca defined the area named for him by studying a stroke victim. In 1861 Broca met a patient who had been given the nickname "Tan," because "tan" was the only syllable he had been able to utter for the past 21 years. When Tan died, an autopsy revealed that a portion of his left frontal lobe about the size of a golf ball had been liquefied by a massive stroke years before.A few years later German neurologist Carl Wernicke identified a second language center farther back, in the brain's left temporal lobe. Patients with strokes or other damage to Wernicke's area are able to talk freely, but they cannot comprehend language, and nothing they say makes any sense.Until recently, damaged brains were the best source of information about the origins of normal cognitive function. A World War I soldier with a small-bore bullet wound in the back of his head might also, for instance, have a vacancy in his field of vision caused by a corresponding injury in his visual cortex. A stroke victim might see noses, eyes, and mouths, but not be able to put them together into a face, revealing that facial recognition is a discrete mental faculty carried out in the region of cortex destroyed by the stroke. In the 1950s American neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield used an electrode to directly stimulate spots on the brains of hundreds of epilepsy patients while they were awake during operations. Penfield discovered that each part of the body was clearly mapped out in a strip of cortex on the brain's opposite side. A person's right foot, for example, responded to a mild shock delivered to a point in the left motor cortex adjacent to one that would produce a similar response in the patient's right leg. Stimulating other locations on the cortical surface might elicit a specific taste, a vivid childhood memory, or a fragment of a long-forgotten tune.The two surgeons in the UCLA operating room are now about to apply Penfield's technique to Corina's Broca's area. They're already in the general neighborhood, but before removing her tumor they must find the exact address for Corina's specific language abilities. The fact that she is bilingual requires even greater care than normal: The neural territories governing her English and Spanish may be adjacent, or—more likely, since she learned both languages at an early age—may at least partially overlap. Susan Bookheimer, the neuropsychologist communicating with Corina under the paper tent, shows her a picture on a card from a stack. At the same time, chief surgeon Linda Liau touches her brain with an electrode, delivering a mild shock. Corina feels nothing, but function is momentarily inhibited in that spot."What's this, sweetie?" Bookheimer asks. Groggy, Corina stares at the picture."Saxophone," she whispers."Good!" says Bookheimer, flipping through her stack of cards. The electrode is not touching a point critical to language. Meanwhile Liau moves the electrode a fraction of an inch. "And this one?""Unicorn.""Very good. ¿Y éste?""Casa.""¿Y éste?"Corina hesitates. "¿Bicicleta?" she says. But it is not a bicycle; it is a pair of antlers. When Corina makes a mistake or struggles to identify a picture of some simple object, the doctors know they have hit upon a critical area, and they label the spot with a square of sterile paper, like a tiny Post-it note.So far, this is all standard procedure. (Liau, whose own mother died of breast cancer that spread to her brain, has performed some 600 similar operations.) But the mapping of Corina's brain is about to take a turn into the future. There are a dozen people bustling about in the operating room, twice the number needed for a typical brain tumor operation. The extras are here to use optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) during surgery, a technique being developed here at UCLA by Arthur Toga and Andrew Cannestra, one of the surgeons assisting Liau.A special camera mounted on a boom is swung into position above Corina's frontal lobe. As she continues to name the pictures on the cards or responds to simple questions (What is the color of grass? What is an animal that barks?), the camera records minute changes in the way light is reflected off the surface of her brain. The changes indicate an increase in blood flow, which in turn is an indication of cognitive activity in that exact spot.When Corina answers "green," or "dog," the precise pattern of neural circuits firing in her Broca's area and surrounding tissue is captured by the camera and sent to a monitor in the corner of the room. From there the image is instantly uploaded to a supercomputer in UCLA's Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, a few floors above. There it joins 50,000 other scans collected from over 10,000 individuals, using an array of imaging technologies. Thus Corina becomes one galaxy in an expanding universe of new information on the human brain."Every person's brain is as unique as their face," says Toga, who directs the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging and is observing the operation today from above his surgical mask. "All this stuff is sliding around, and we don't know all the rules. But by studying thousands of people, we may be able to learn more of them, which will tell us how the brain is organized."Most of the images in UCLA's brain atlas are produced by a groundbreaking new technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Like OIS, fMRI monitors increases in blood flow as an indirect measurement of cognitive activity. But, while not nearly as precise, fMRI is completely noninvasive and can thus be used to study brain function not just in surgical patients like Corina, but in anyone who can tolerate spending a few minutes in the tubular cavity of an MRI machine. The technique has been used to explore the neural circuitry of people suffering from depression, dyslexia, schizophrenia, and a host of other neurological conditions. Just as important, it has been trained on the brains of hundreds of thousands of subjects while they perform a given task—everything from twitching a finger to recalling a specific face, confronting a moral dilemma, experiencing orgasm, or comparing the tastes of Pepsi and Coke.What does the new science tell us about how Corina's 28-year-old brain produced Corina's 28-year-old mind? In terms of brain growth, her birth in Santa Paula, a farming community about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) north of Los Angeles, was a nonevent. In contrast, the previous nine months in her mother's womb were a neurodevelopmental drama of epic proportions.Four weeks after conception, the embryo that would become Corina was producing half a million neurons every minute. Over the next several weeks these cells migrated to the brain, to specific destinations determined by genetic cues and interactions with neighboring neurons. During the first and second trimesters of her mother's pregnancy the neurons began to reach tentacles out to each other, establishing synapses—points of contact—at a rate of two million a second. Three months before she was born, Corina possessed more brain cells than she ever would again: an overwrought jungle of connections. There were far more than she needed as a fetus in the cognitively unchallenging womb—far more, even, than she would need as an adult.Then, just weeks away from birth, the trend reversed. Groups of neurons competed with each other to recruit other neurons into expanding circuits with specific functions. Those that lost died off in a pruning process scientists call "neural Darwinism."The circuits that survived were already partly tuned to the world beyond. At birth, she was already predisposed to the sound of her mother's voice over that of strangers; to the cadence of nursery rhymes she might have overheard in the womb; and perhaps to the tastes of her mother's Mexican cuisine, which she had sampled generously in the amniotic fluid. The last of her senses to develop fully was her vision. Even so, she clearly recognized her mother's face at just two days old.For the next 18 months, Corina was a learning machine. While older brains need some sort of context for learning—a reason, such as a reward, to pay attention to one stimulus over another—baby brains soak up everything coming through their senses."They may look like they're just sitting there staring at things," says Mark Johnson of the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development at Birkbeck, University of London. "But right from the start, babies are born to seek information." As Corina experienced her new world, neural circuits that received repeated stimulation developed stronger synaptic connections, while those that lay dormant atrophied. At birth, for instance, she was able to hear every sound of every language on Earth. As the syllables of Spanish (and later English) filled her ears, the language areas of her brain became more sensitive to just those sounds, while losing their responsiveness to the sounds of, say, Arabic or Swahili.If there is one part of the brain where the "self" part of Corina's mind began, it would be in the prefrontal cortex—a region just behind her forehead that extends to about her ears. By the age of two or so, circuits here have started to develop. Before the prefrontal cortex comes on line, a child with a smudge on her cheek will try to wipe the spot off her reflection in a mirror, rather than understand that the image in the mirror is herself, and wipe her own cheek.But as scientists are learning about all higher cognitive functions, they're discovering that a sense of self is not a discrete part of the mind that resides in a particular location, like the carburetor in a car, or that matures all at once, like a flower blooming. It may involve various regions and circuits in the brain, depending on what specific sense one is talking about, and the circuits may develop at different times.So while Corina may have recognized herself in a mirror before she was three years old, it might have been another year before she understood that the self she saw in the mirror persists intact through time. In studies conducted by Daniel Povinelli and his colleagues at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, young children were videotaped playing a game, during which an experimenter secretly put a large sticker in their hair. When shown the videotape a few minutes later, most children over the age of three reached up to their own hair to remove the sticker, demonstrating that they understood the self in the video was the same as the one in the present moment. Younger children did not make the connection.If Corina had a sticker caught in her hair when she was three, she doesn't remember it. Her first memory is of the thrill of going to the store with her mother to pick out a special dress, pink and lacy. She was four years old. She does not recall anything earlier because her hippocampus, part of the limbic system deep in the brain that stores long-term memories, had not yet matured.That doesn't mean earlier memories don't exist in Corina's mind. Because her father left when she was just two, she can't consciously remember how he got drunk sometimes and abused her mother. But the emotions associated with the memory might be stored in her amygdala, another structure in the brain's limbic system that may be functional as early as birth. While highly emotional memories etched in the amygdala may not be accessible to the conscious mind, they might still influence the way we act and feel beyond our awareness.Different areas of the brain develop in various ways at different rates into early adulthood. Certainly the pruning and shaping of Corina's brain during her early months as a learning machine were critical. But according to recent imaging studies of children conducted over a period of years at UCLA and the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, a second growth spurt in gray matter occurs just before puberty.Assuming she was a typical girl, Corina's cortex was thickest at the age of 11. (Boys peak about a year and a half later.) This wave of growth was followed by another thinning of gray matter that lasted throughout her teen years, and indeed has only recently been completed. The first areas of her brain to finish the process were those involved in basic functions, such as sensory processing and movement, in the extreme front and back of the brain. Next came regions governing spatial orientation and language in the parietal lobes on the sides of the brain.The last area of the brain to reach maturity is the prefrontal cortex, where the so-called executive brain resides—where we make social judgments, weigh alternatives, plan for the future, and hold our behavior in check."The executive brain doesn't hit adult levels until the age of 25," says Jay Giedd of the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the lead scientists on the neuroimaging studies. "At puberty, you have adult passions, sex drive, energy, and emotion, but the reining in doesn't happen until much later." It is no wonder, perhaps, that teenagers seem to lack good judgment or the ability to restrain impulses. "We can vote at 18," says Giedd, "and drive a car. But you can't rent a car until you're 25. In terms of brain anatomy, the only ones who have it right are the car-rental people."Gray-matter maturity, however, does not signal the end of mental change. Even now, Corina's brain is still very much a work in progress. If there is a single theme that has dominated the past decade of neurological research, it is the growing appreciation of the brain's plasticity—its ability to reshape and reorganize itself through adulthood. Blind people who read Braille show a remarkable increase in the size of the region of their somatosensory cortex—a region on the side of the brain that processes the sense of touch—devoted to their right index finger. Violin players show an analogous spread of the somatosensory region associated with the fingers of their left hand, which move about the neck of the instrument playing notes, as opposed to those of their right hand, which merely holds the bow."Ten years ago most neuroscientists saw the brain as a kind of computer, developing fixed functions early," says Michael Merzenich of the University of California, San Francisco, a pioneer in understanding brain plasticity. "What we now appreciate is that the brain is continually revising itself throughout life."While the brain's plasticity begins to degrade in later life, it may never be too late to teach an old brain new tricks. According to preliminary studies in Merzenich's lab, even the memories of pre-senile individuals in their 60s and 70s can, with focused training, be dramatically rejuvenated. Plasticity does have limits, however. If certain critical areas of the cortex—Broca's area, for instance—are destroyed by stroke or tumor, the patient will probably never recover the function once performed by the now silent circuits.Which brings us back to Corina today. Her tumor has already demolished an egg-size portion of her left frontal lobe containing circuits important to personality, planning, and drive. Fortunately, the brain has some built-in redundancy in these higher functions, and her family has not noticed any change in her personality: The corresponding region of her right frontal lobe is probably shouldering much of the extra load.But the tumor must be removed now as quickly as possible. The scientists have finished the optical intrinsic imaging of her brain, plus another experimental scanning technique using infrared light. The camera's boom has been rolled back.The operating room empties of all but the personnel critical to the operation itself. Corina is very tired, but she must stay awake just a little longer. Using an electronic scalpel, Dr. Liau carefully begins to cut into the brain flesh at the border between the tumor and Corina's Broca's area. Under the tent, Dr. Bookheimer flashes more cards in front of her face."What's this? A door? Good!""¿Y éste?…"As the scalpel cuts deeper, Liau's eyes are tense above her surgical mask. She must excise every scrap of cancerous tissue. Yet one slip, and the damage cannot be undone. Once the cut along the border is finished, Corina's consciousness is no longer needed, and she can rest."How's she doing?" asks Liau."Perfect," says Bookheimer. "No problems at all.""Good," says Liau. "Let's put her back to sleep." An anesthesiologist makes the required adjustment to the chemical mix trickling through Corina's IV. I walk around to where I can see her face."Corina," I say, as her eyes begin to close, "you have a beautiful brain." She smiles faintly."Thank you," she says.BIGGER BRAINEvery day, Glen McNeil spends six or seven hours buzzing about the streets of London on his motorbike with a map clipped to the handlebars. McNeil, 28, is a “knowledge boy,” engaged in the years-long memory training required to earn his green badge and become a licensed London taxi driver, like his father.If McNeill fulfills his dream, his brain may be the bigger for it, at least in one part. The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure that is part of the brain's limbic system, is critical to many functions of memory and learning, including processing spatial relationships in the environment. An MRI study published in 2000 by scientists at University College, London, showed that in London taxi drivers the rear portion of the hippocampus was enlarged compared with those of control subjects, confounding the long-held notion that the adult human brain cannot grow. But the bonus in brain tissue may not have come free of charge. On average, the front portion of the hippocampus was smaller than normal in the taxi drivers, suggesting that the effort to build an increasingly detailed mental map of the city had recruited neighboring regions to the cause.If the hippocampus can grow in human adults, what about other parts of the brain? According to a recent study in Germany, learning how to juggle for three months resulted in an increase in the amount of gray matter in two areas involved in visual and motor activity. When the newly trained jugglers stopped practicing, however, these regions shrank back. Furthermore, neither the driver study nor the juggler study could discern whether the growth in brain volume was due to the reorganization of existing circuits, an increased number of neural connections, or most intriguingly, the birth of actual new brain cells—an idea thought preposterous until recently. In 1998 Fred H. Gage of the SaIk Institute in La JoIIa, California, showed that new cells can indeed grow in the adult human hippocampus. Gage believes that stem cells, capable of developing into functioning new neurons, may exist elsewhere in the brain. Better understanding of such nerve regeneration could provide hope for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and a host of other degenerative brain disorders.Meanwhile, Glen McNeilI has more work to do with his hippocampus. He has to pass three sets of examinations testing his knowledge of London streets—and then prove familiarity with the surrounding towns."The suburbs is the last 'urdle," he says in his thick Cockney accent. "After that you get your lit'l green badge."IN YOUR FACEForty years ago, psychologist Paul Ekman of the University of California, San Francisco, showed photographs of Americans expressing various emotions to the isolated Fore people in New Guinea. Though most of the Fore had never been exposed to Western faces, they readily recognized expressions of anger, happiness, sadness, disgust, and fear and surprise (which are difficult to differentiate). When Ekman conducted the experiment in reverse, showing Fore faces to Westerners, the emotions were again unmistakable. Ekman's now classic study gave powerful support to the notion that the facial expressions of basic emotions are universal, an idea first put forth by Charles Darwin.According to Ekman, these six emotions (plus contempt) are themselves universal, evolved to prepare us to deal quickly with circumstances we believe will affect our welfare. Some emotional triggers are universal as well. A sudden invasion of your field of vision triggers fear, for instance. But most emotional triggers are learned. The smell of newly mowed hay will conjure up different emotions in someone who spent idyllic childhood summers in the country and someone who was forced to work long hours on a farm. Once such an emotional association is made, it is difficult, if not impossible, to unmake it."Emotion is the least plastic part of the brain," says Ekman. But we can learn to manage our emotions better. For instance, the shorter the time between the onset of an emotion and when we become consciously aware of it—what Ekman calls the refractory period—the more likely we are to double-check to see if the emotion is appropriate to the situation. One way to shorten the refractory period is to be aware of what triggers our various emotions.AFRAID OF WHAT?It's a jungle out there, or at least it used to be. The prehistoric environment that shaped our brains sizzled with snakes, growling beasts, swooping birds, and other natural perils. Individuals who retreated spontaneously from such threats survived, while those who cogitated—maybe it's a friendly snake, but why is it coiling up like that?—did not live long enough to pass on their genes.Natural selection may thus long ago have hard-wired the primate brain with a fear response to such dangers. On the other hand, experiments have shown that laboratory-raised monkeys that have never seen a snake in a natural setting show no more alarm at the sight of one than the young primate in the picture below, blithely nestled in the coils of an 11-foot (3.4-meter) python. So is fear of snakes in our nature or a product of our nurture?In a series of studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the 1980s, researchers tested the question by comparing lab-raised monkeys with monkeys born in the wild. Labraised monkeys with no previous fear of snakes began to show fear after watching wild-born monkeys, both live and in videotapes, show fear of snakes. But when videos were manipulated so that wild-born monkeys appeared to be afraid of flowers, lab-raised monkeys watching them didn't take the cue. It seems likely that there is indeed, etched into the primate brain, a predisposition to dread natural phenomena that can hurt us, but no predisposition to learn to fear something that will not. But the predisposition requires social experience to be activated. As the lab-raised monkeys learned fear of snakes from other monkeys, the baby stands a good chance of acquiring a fear of snakes after watching other humans.In more recent research, scientists have traced the neural pathways of fear to a small, almond-shaped structure in the brain's emotional system called the amygdala. It appears to translate the perception of danger into action in two ways.Our cortex is constantly bombarded with information from our eyes, ears, and other sensory organs. One route for this pipeline sends a torrent of detailed, refined information from high-level cortical regions to the amygdala, which turbocharges the processing of fearful or other emotional stimuli at the expense of less urgent information. If you're driving and listening to the news on the radio when the driver in front of you taps the brakes, your attention will quickly drop off the news report and signal your foot to move to the brake pedal. A second, even faster pathway sends crude information from the senses through subcortical regions directly to the amygdala, bypassing the cortex altogether. If the car in front makes a full-fledged panic stop, this more primitive pathway signals you to slam on the brakes—even before the information reaches the cortical regions that make you conscious of your actions. The milliseconds' head start on your reaction may be enough to mean the difference between life and death.AUTISTIC GENIUSFifteen-year-old Tito Mukhopadhyay squats beside his mother on his bed, rocking, his hands flapping wildly. The gestures are typical of a severely autistic individual, as are his avoidance of eye contact and his unintelligible grunts and moans. But Tito is far from inarticulate. A visitor asks him why he is moving about so much."I know it looks different," he answers, using a pencil and paper to scrawl his reply. "But I got into this habit to find and feel my own scattered self."Initially diagnosed as mentally retarded, he was dragged from one doctor to another in his native India by a mother desperate to find the cause of her son's abnormal behavior and language impairment. Through relentless, sometimes unorthodox, training she broke through the barrier of silence, teaching Tito to add and subtract, to enjoy literature, and eventually to communicate by writing, at first by tying a pencil to his hand. Because of her efforts Tito, rare among low-functioning autistics, can describe with powerful clarity what the condition feels like from the inside.Tito's vivid autobiographical reflections reveal a sensibility and intelligence greater than his years. In Beyond the Silence, written between the ages of eight and eleven and published in England in 2000 (published as The Mind Tree in the U.S. in 2003) he chronicles his early attempts to cope with the cacophony of disconnected information arriving through his senses and his profound struggle to control his own body and behavior. He wrote of two distinct selves, a thinking self "which was filled with learnings and feelings," and an acting self that was "weird and full of actions," over which he had no more control than if it belonged to another person altogether. "The two selves stayed in their own selves, isolated from each other.""Tito's remarkable achievements haven't overcome his autism," says Michael Merzenich, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied Tito. "There is still chaos occurring in his brain." Where does that chaos come from? There is no doubt that genes play a role in at least some forms of the disorder. Also, infants who later develop autism often undergo a period of abnormal rapid brain growth in the first year of life, which may be related to an overproduction of cells that carry nerve impulses in the brain's white matter.Researchers Chris and Uta Frith at University College in London have pinpointed a suite of structures—one above the eyes, another near the ear, and a third high up on the sides of the brain—that allow us to infer what others are thinking and relate to people accordingly. These regions appear to be less active in individuals with autism and Asperger's syndrome, a milder form of the disorder. But other parts of the brain may also be involved, including the amygdala and the hippocampus. It is doubtful that a disorder with such a broad spectrum of symptoms and pathologies has any single cause."Men and women are puzzled by what I do," writes Tito. "Doctors use different terminologies to describe me. I just wonder."PERFECT PITCHMusic is native to the human mind. There is not a culture on Earth that does not have it, and our brains are wired to apprehend and be moved by its magic. By contrast, absolute or perfect pitch—the ability to identify a specific musical tone without hearing it in relation to another one—is an exceedingly rare gift, found in as few as one in 10,000 individuals in Western societies.People who possess the trait can identify the sound of an E flat or G sharp as effortlessly as anyone else can see that a fire engine is red or the sky is blue. Not surprisingly, it is more common among musicians. Mozart had it, and so did Beethoven. But what accounts for this peculiar faculty?Some research suggests the phenomenon may not be so unusual after all. Investigators at the University of California, San Diego, found that many people who speak tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese and Vietnamese, possess a form of absolute pitch, speaking words and repeating them days later at the same pitch. Another study found that 7 percent of non-Asian freshmen at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, were endowed with absolute pitch, as opposed to fully 63 percent of their Asian counterparts at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing.But the relationship between absolute pitch and language cannot be the whole story. Not all tonal language speakers have absolute pitch, and not all absolute pitch possessors speak tonal languages. In Japan the trait is relatively common compared with the West, and Japanese is not a tonal language. Perhaps a genetic predisposition for absolute pitch is more common among Asian populations. But a more likely explanation for its prevalence in Japan may be the value the culture places on early music training, exemplified by these young violinists undergoing Suzuki Method training.BABY KNOWSWhat goes on inside a baby's head? Infants cannot communicate their thoughts directly, of course, nor are they likely to lie still in the earsplitting confinement of an MRI machine long enough for researchers to map activity in their brains. At Babylab, part of the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development at Birkbeck, University of London, researcher Jordy Kaufman takes a direct route to reading a baby's mind.Kaufman outfits six-month-olds with helmets of electrodes to record electrical activity in their brains while they watch a video cartoon of a train disappearing into a tunnel.Traditional behavioral studies have implied that infants lack a sense of object permanence: When an object they've been looking at is suddenly hidden from view, they behave as if the object no longer exists. But Babylab's high-tech hairnet records a burst of activity in babies' right temporal lobes as they watch the train disappear, similar to activity measured in adults who are asked to keep an unseen object in mind. And when the tunnel is lifted to reveal no train inside—a violation of object permanence—the electrical activity spikes upward, suggesting that the babies are trying to maintain a mental representation of the train in the face of visual evidence to the contrary.Does this mean that object permanence is prewired in the brain? Perhaps. But Kaufman prefers to see the development of mind as a fecund interaction between nature and nurture, as an infant's innate predispositions guide it to seek out experience that in turn nourishes and tunes specialized neural networks.A predisposition to look at faces, for instance, seems to be innate, involving primitive brain regions. But Babylab's Hanife Halit has demonstrated that regions in the higher level temporal cortex become more specialized in facial recognition through the first year of life, at first responding to upright and upside-down monkey and human faces, and finally just to upright human faces. Normal babies also prefer faces that are looking back at them, while autistic children do not. Halit speculates that without an initial predisposition for engaging faces, a baby's brain might fail to be enriched by the social interactions that guide normal development—leading to the wholesale indifference to social stimuli that is one of the hallmarks of autism.ALTERED MINDAs recently as the late 1980s the human brain was considered to be a sort of biological computer that, as one scientist put it, "secretes thoughts the way kidneys secrete urine." We now know that the brain is much more malleable and fluidly organized than the analogy to computer hardware suggests, and that it changes with every perception and every action.Over the past decade compelling evidence for neuroplasticity has come from studies of the blind by Alvaro Pascual-Leone, now a professor of neurology at Harvard University and Boston's Beth Israel hospital.In the early 1990s Pascual-Leone and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health showed that as blind adults learned to read Braille, the region of the somatosensory (touch-sensitive) cortex responding to input from the reading finger greatly enlarged. In 1996 the researchers made a more startling discovery: Input from the sensitized finger was lighting up not only the somatosensory cortex on the side of the brain, but parts of the visual cortex near the back of the brain as well.Could it be that in adult blind people, new nerve connections were reaching out across the brain to occupy neural real estate left vacant by the lack of input from their sightless eyes? Pascual-Leone tests that notion by blindfolding sighted individuals for five days. After as few as two days, fMRI scans showed bursts of activity in their visual cortex when they performed tasks with their fingers, or even when they listened to tones or words. This was far too short a time for any nerve connections to grow from the touch and hearing regions of the cortex to the area processing sight. And after just a few hours with the blindfold removed, the visual cortex again responded only to input from the eyes.So what accounts for this sudden ability of the brain to "see" with input from the fingers and ears? Pascual-Leone suggests the connections from these senses to the visual cortex may already be there but remain unused so long as the eyes are doing their job. When the eyes shut down, the next best way of getting the same information springs into action."It's provocative, but we're arguing that the brain may not be organized into sensory modalities at all," he says. What neuroscientists have been calling the visual cortex for the past century might not be devoted exclusively to the eyes, but should more accurately be defined as the area of the brain best able to discriminate spatial relationships—and it will grab whatever input is available to perform that task.EXTREME EXPRESSIONOn any given morning Alice Flaherty, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is writing at her computer by 4:30 a.m. During the day she may also write on scrap paper, toilet paper, her surgical scrubs, and if nothing else is handy, on her own skin. Some of her best ideas come when she's in the shower, so she keeps a waxed pencil there and writes on the walls. She also has a pen attached to her bicycle, just in case the muse hits her in mid-pedal stroke.These days Flaherty's writing obsession is as much pleasure as compulsion. But it grew out of the painful loss she experienced in 1998 at the deaths of her prematurely born twin boys. Already prolific, Flaherty developed a full-blown case of hypergraphia, a manic disorder characterized by an irrepressible urge to write—and write, and write. Her writing increased 20-fold. The nagging need to write something down would wake her up in the middle of the night to scribble in the dark, surrounding herself with a litter of scrawled notes. A second episode followed the birth of twin daughters, now healthy five-year-olds.Flaherty's professional and personal interest in hypergraphia eventually led her to take the perhaps not surprising step of writing a book about it. While she speculates that her own worst episodes were triggered by the hormonal pandemonium accompanying birth, the condition is more commonly a symptom of manic depression, mania, and other mood disorders. It is most often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, a disorder that may also lead to hyper-religious feelings and a sense that even the most trivial events are filled with heightened meaning and cosmic importance. The hypergraphic patient's compulsion to write all the time is not, alas, accompanied by any increase in talent. The diatribes of the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, (or the verbal pablum of some Internet blogs) are typical output.Nevertheless, the key role of the temporal lobe in hypergraphia may offer a window into the neural underpinnings of literary creativity, and creativity in general. According to popular wisdom, the right hemisphere of the brain is more creative, while the left brain is more logical and objective. While there is some basis for this belief, it is certainly an oversimplification. As Flaherty discusses in her book The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain, more important to creativity may be the connections through the limbic system—the more primitive, emotional part of the brain—between the temporal lobes on the sides of the brain and the frontal lobes behind the forehead. While the frontal lobes may be important for providing the judgment and flexibility of thought that underlies talent, structures in the temporal lobes and limbic system supply drive and motivation, which Flaherty believes are more important parts of the creative equation than talent itself. This applies not only to writing, but to all kinds of creative activity."To be a truly creative chess player," she says, "probably just loving the game and playing it ten hours a day may be more important than having some special pattern recognition ability in your brain."SPIRITUAL STATEFor 2,500 years Buddhists have employed strict training techniques to guide their mental state away from destructive emotions and toward a more compassionate, happier frame of being. Spurred by the cascade of new evidence for the brain's plasticity, Western neuroscientists have taken a keen interest. Can meditation literally change the mind?For the past several years Richard Davidson and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been studying brain activity in Tibetan monks, both in meditative and non-meditative states. Davidson's group had shown earlier that people who are inclined to fall prey to negative emotions displayed a pattern of persistent activity in regions of their right prefrontal cortex. In those with more positive temperaments the activity occurred in the left prefrontal cortex instead. When Davidson ran the experiment on a senior Tibetan lama skilled in meditation, the lama's baseline of activity proved to be much farther to the left of anyone previously tested. Judging from this one study, at least, he was quantifiably the happiest man in the world.Davidson recently tested the prefrontal activity in some volunteers from a high-tech company in Wisconsin. One group of volunteers then received eight weeks of training in meditation, while a control group did not. All the participants also received flu shots.By the end of the study, those who had meditated showed a pronounced shift in brain activity toward the left, "happier," frontal cortex. The meditators also showed a healthier immune response to the flu shot, suggesting that the training affected the body's health as well as the mind's."You don't have to become a Buddhist," says the Dalai Lama himself, who is closely folowing the work of Western cognitive scientists like Davidson. "Everybody has the potential to lead a peaceful, meaningful life."",
"In rapidly growing cities such as Beijing and New Delhi, air pollution has become so severe that respiratory disease is on the rise, flights have been grounded, and the public is often warned against letting children play outside.Chokingly thick blankets of smog are often a byproduct of economic growth, which results in more vehicles on the road and more burning of fossil fuels, especially coal. The bad air can be deadly: Outdoor air pollution, both in cities and rural areas, prematurely killed 3.7 million people worldwide in 2012, according to the World Health Organization. With two-thirds of the population expected to live in cities by 2050, the need to ease urban pollution is particularly acute.The problem goes beyond respiratory health and quality of life: A recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that in India, short-lived air pollutants such as ozone and black carbon, along with the changing climate, cut 2010 crop yields in half.Los Angeles offers an example of what cities can do to reduce pollution. Long notorious for its smog, the car-centric city has seen some air pollutants decline by 98 percent over the past 50 years, even though an increasing population has used more gasoline. Rules to make cars and fuels cleaner helped achieve the reductions, but the city still struggles with air quality issues. In 2014, Los Angeles saw an uptick in smog due to heat and drought, suggesting the fight against air pollution remains a challenge for cities dealing with both climate change and population growth.In the drive to build smarter cities around the world, what is the most important thing we should do to tackle air pollution?Give your rating for the answers below and share your thoughts in the comments.",
"Coffee lovers, rejoice. New research suggests that people who drink two to three cups of coffee a day—caffeinated or not—may have a lower chance of dying from certain illnesses than those who abstain.The study, thought to be the largest of its kind, followed more than 500,000 people in 10 European countries over the course of 16 years. It found that compared with those who don’t drink coffee, those who do show signs of having healthier livers and circulatory systems, as well as lower levels of inflammation, says epidemiologist and study leader Marc Gunter. The findings also indicated that “higher coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death from any cause,” including circulatory diseases and digestive diseases, says Gunter, who heads the nutrition and metabolism section of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.Previous, smaller scale studies have found a link between coffee drinking and increased resistance to certain ailments, but Gunter’s findings provide the most substantial evidence to date. “This digestive disease relationship, which was strongest for liver disease deaths, is particularly striking,” he says.Gunter says the next step is to analyze coffee’s chemical composition in hopes of understanding what makes the beverage beneficial. So he’s going back to his research—and the rest of us, it appears, should be going back for refills.",
"Four days a week Andy Ross travels—by car, train, and bus—120 miles from his home in Auburn, California, to his job at a bank in San Francisco. His eight-hour round-trip typically begins at 6 a.m. He’ll be at his desk by 10, having begun work earlier on his laptop. He leaves the office by 4 p.m. and arrives home about 8.Ross became a “supercommuter” eight years ago, after he left a tech business and took the bank job. He joined nearly 105,000 people who spend at least 90 minutes getting to jobs in the Bay Area. Ross and his wife kept their four-bedroom home in Auburn rather than move to San Francisco, where the median price is $1.4 million—more than three times that in Auburn. “I love working at my job. As a result, I’m now doing this crazy commute,” he says. “There are a lot more of us long-haul commuters” than a decade ago.",
"It’s a day like any other in San Diego, built from blue skies, 74 degrees, palm trees, school buses, traffic congestion, Taco Bell, and Hobby Lobby. The morning light is flat. Yet at the horizon, a haze, an implacable stirring.Drive away from the Pacific Ocean, into the working-class enclaves and commercial strip mall anywheres, and look closer. There, in that random Nissan chug-chug-chugging at the red light, or there, in that minivan by the curb, you see a life’s possessions, consolidated and squashed into rounded lumps of shirts, towels, and blankets flooding through the gaps between the headrests, their driver’s postures pitched forward out of habit.Now drive about nine miles from the beach to Golden Hill, to a parking lot beneath the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway at the New Life Assembly of God church. The lot is leased by the nonprofit Dreams for Change. Every night around six, you’ll find more cars stuffed with entire lifetimes, parked in the fading afternoon dusk, their occupants looking uniformly beaten down.Lola Cheatham holds daughter Winry while Darrick Alexander holds older daughter Maybel in the Nissan minivan they lived in at a “safe lot” in San Diego’s Golden Hill neighborhood. In December 2018 the family found an apartment that they could afford.For two years Darrick Alexander has lived in the parking lot with his girlfriend, Lola Cheatham, and their three daughters. The lot is part of the Safe Parking Program, one of 35 secure lots in Southern California run by charities and nonprofits and set aside each night for more than 1,500 people who sleep in their cars.Alexander has just arrived from his job as a manager at a drug treatment and mental health facility, at the end of a 40-minute evening commute. He’s calm, soft-spoken, and disarmingly agreeable for a man in his 30s with a family in this situation. The gray leather seats of his 2002 Volkswagen Passat already are reclined for sleeping, the sunscreens ready to slip into place, more for privacy than any California sunrise. His daughters—ages four, six, and 14—will sleep in their mother’s van, parked nearby.Many in the lot have full-time jobs. But they can’t afford housing in San Diego, one of the nation’s most expensive markets, where the median home value is $633,000 and the average rental is about $2,000 a month.They need to live relatively close to where they work, so they wind up living in their cars. Without that reliable commute to whatever paycheck they earn, they’ll never afford housing.Like many Americans, they’re painfully aware of how conjoined the need for a reasonable commute and affordable housing has become. Their lives are a coiled convergence of personal problems, rising rents and stagnating wages, and little opportunity for housing in metro areas, of minimum wages rising in cities where people who need those wages can’t afford to find a home anyway. It’s never one thing, but like one of those chalkboards on The Wire, a Spirograph of lines running here and there, suggesting vast conspiracy.In this case, the result is to deny people from having both a home and a means to work near that home. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost 130 million Americans commute to work daily, the majority by car.After taking time off work to recover from a car accident, Kimberly Doll says she was fired from her security job and lost her apartment. With an eviction on her record, it has been difficult for her to rent, so she stays in her car in a safe lot in San Diego.Brandie Costa is unable to work due to ongoing health problems, so she and her son, Jayden Smith, sleep in their car parked between the highway and a hotel in San Diego.Destinée moved to San Diego from Merle, Oregon, with her mother, Lisa Zuniga, in 2015. They have slept in their car in the safe lot at Jewish Family Service for several months. Zuniga suffers from mental health issues that make it difficult to secure work and afford housing.Since 1980, the first year the bureau studied commuting, the average commute for most Americans is up 20 percent and now approaches an average of 30 minutes. But the fastest growing commuter class, by commuting length, are those who commute at least 90 minutes. Almost four million have a commute this long. And it’s not just those outside of San Diego, New York, Los Angeles, Boston, or Washington, D.C.: Three-quarters of the metropolitan areas in the U.S. have seen commutes longer than 90 minutes spike.I’m from Rhode Island. The percentage of workers there who travel at least 90 minutes to a job now—toward Boston, most likely—is up 40 percent in recent years.But, say, you are a service worker whose neighborhood in San Francisco gentrified, whose rent has spiked, and who is being pushed farther and farther from the city. (The median cost of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is now $3,460.)So you move 80 miles inland to Stockton, California, and commute to San Francisco daily. You’d be among the 10 percent of that workforce who live in Stockton. In Riverside, California, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, the percentage of workers driving to L.A. daily is 7.3 percent.All of this is steered in part by the need to find affordable housing.You might have heard that wages are not rising much. But the cost of housing is rising everywhere. A recent study by the personal finance firm GOBankingRates found that in, say, Austin, Texas, where more than 32,000 people are commuting daily to Dallas, a salary of about $73,000 is necessary to live comfortably; in 2017, it was about $55,000. And according to the Brookings Institution, the working poor already carry a disproportionate burden of commuting expenses, never mind housing.If you are considered the "working poor," 6 percent of your salary typically goes to your commute; 8 percent if you drive. For those in all other income categories, it’s about 3 percent. A University of Minnesota study found that drives of 90 minutes or more are increasingly common, not just for lawyers but for janitors and cooks; for school teachers, the number who drive that long to school went up 26 percent from 2002 to 2015.Think you can just move close to a commuter rail station, and boom, problem solved?According to the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy nonprofit that studies living issues in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area, 60 percent of municipalities there have passed zoning laws that restrict the ability of those communities to build the kind of mixed-income housing that people who work in service jobs there might be able to afford.The safe-parking project began in Santa Barbara more than a decade ago and then spread along the West Coast. Many of the residents are not chronically homeless but have been middle-class—they come from families that lived in the region for generations but then began to struggle after a job loss, a rent hike, a divorce, a medical bill, a foreclosure, an addiction. They come from areas that lack affordable housing, which includes much of California. Gentrification of their neighborhoods left them unable to both live and work there.Alexander and others at the lot did the calculations and decided that if they no longer could afford to pay for decent housing and a car to get them to work, then the car had to stay.Since his daughters will sleep in their mother’s van, parked nearby, everything he owns fits in this car, an interlocking Tetris of garbage bags and suitcases.The church, a white-on-white take on a Spanish mission that could become a coffeehouse with a little imagination, looms tall above the car, casting sharp geometric angles across the parking lot.It’s a week before Thanksgiving. Alexander’s girls spin in sweaty, frenzied laps, chasing each other and flying plastic bags behind them like parachutes.The four-year-old, Winry, plows headlong into him: “Daddy, bathroom?”He walks her into the church; like everyone else here, they get five minutes in the bathroom. When they return, he watches the girl dart off and says softly: “They want somewhere to live. We tell them, ‘We are going to get you there.’ ” Those bags, he says, are for snack night, which tonight means a visit from a local church group that drops off sandwiches, salads, and bread.When the safe lot closes for the day at six a.m., Alexander heads to work and Cheatham takes the girls to a park. They pay two dollars for showers at a community center. The older girls have been homeschooled at a library. Winry has lived in a safe lot for most of her life. At night the family returns when the lot opens at six and claims the usual parking spaces. Children must be in their cars by nine.Once the girls and their mother are asleep in the van, Alexander tucks a pillow behind his head, pulls up a thin blanket, and curls into the driver’s seat of his car. At night, he says, “I still wake up to every noise.”Thanks to aid from a San Diego housing program, after years of living in the safe lot, in December 2018 Alexander’s family would finally find an apartment they could afford.“Tequila Ray Snorkel,” an entrepreneur, lives in a van near Hunters Point in San Francisco.Nikki Mensick has lived in a house truck for more than three years with her boyfriend, cat, and dog. She is a student at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. She and her boyfriend bought and fixed up the house truck because they could not afford housing. Nikki is a poetry student and her boyfriend studies engineering and works at a Subway sandwich shop.Originally from Portland, Oregon, Thomas Lindley, 49, came to San Diego to care for his ailing dad. He sleeps in his car with a 14-year-old pit bull, Kiya, in a safe lot each night. Lindley sold his house in Portland and bought a sailboat, but after it was impounded, he couldn’t afford to get it back. He works as a Lyft driver and handyman.The lot holds a few dozen cars. By 8 p.m., it’s full—actually, it’s full every night. Other safe lots in San Diego hold three times this many cars; one lot is specifically for parents with children. Most of those are full too. Many have waiting lists.Ava Blackwell began working as a case manager for the Safe Parking Program five years ago. She says she cried a lot at first. Now she walks me through the New Life lot with solemn, efficient dispassion: That car holds a whole family. No one in this car speaks English, but they all work. The owner of that car paints houses. The owner of the car with bicycles commutes two hours each way.We pass Ferris Hamaw, who is 51 and wears a wool cap and shorts; his body is lean and fit, his face is much older than his years. He says he was an auto mechanic once. When onboard computers became standard, many years ago, he was “caught off guard” and never recovered from the sea change. Now he goes to a local continuing education program to gain skills for a better job. Because the reach of public transit in San Diego can be relatively limited, he walks five miles to school, leaving the lot before dawn so he can find an empty classroom to finish homework. His car broke down; he can’t afford to fix it, but he sleeps in it. He regards it as his eventual ticket out. The way he sees it, he is sacrificing traditional housing for job training that will pull him out of the lot entirely.He’s betting wisely.Having a means of commuting to work—reliable transportation—is the most common factor in escaping poverty, according to a 2015 Harvard study. None of this is surprising to Teresa Smith, who moved decades ago from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to San Diego for college. She spent years working on generational poverty for nonprofits. Nine years ago, inspired by the Santa Barbara safe lots, she created safe lots in San Diego. Several years after that, the city of San Diego, finally, formally recognized (and partly funded) her project for the first time.“We opened under dark of night,” she says, laughing. She looks a little like David Bowie, with the staccato laugh and the sad smile of someone used to being asked for help. She said that she was seeing a new breed of homeless: “We would send them down to a shelter and they would come running back, ‘Oh my God, there’s no way I’m staying in that shelter. I’m not homeless. I just lost my job...’” She also kept hearing that they needed their cars, that they couldn’t afford to park them anywhere overnight. Many had weighed their options and made the choice between securing affordable housing and living farther away from their jobs and paying for the extra-long commute or simply living in aging vehicles, closer to their work.When you talk with urban planners and transportation experts about affordable housing and its relationship to commuting—when you flip through transportation study after transportation study—California inevitably looks like ground zero. Stockton now sees at least 10 percent of its commuters traveling 90 minutes on average to a job in San Francisco; the commutes from Riverside, east of Los Angeles, often get much longer. The rents are cheaper there, but if you do low-income service work in Los Angeles or San Francisco (where minimum wage tends to be typically higher than in surrounding cities), living within easy reach of that coastal job is rarely an option now. (Read why cities of the future must deprioritize cars.)But that’s far from the whole picture.Ask an urban planner what keeps them awake at night, you often hear about affordable housing and a reliance on cobbled-together solutions that aren’t real solutions. You hear about cages in Hong Kong doubling as apartments. And neighborhoods in New Zealand where landlords rent out tents in residential backyards. And squatters in empty London high-rises who remain for a fee (as “temporary guardians”).Nancy Lopez, a dishwasher and cook in downtown San Jose, lives in a converted back porch. A transgender woman, she came to the United States from Mexico to escape violence and to get away from her disapproving family. She is studying to become a chef.Phil Lasley, an assistant research scientist with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, says the biggest concern for city planners is finding creative ways for housing people in service jobs and getting them to those jobs. He told me of workers residing in storage units, and of informal agreements in Austin that allow commuters to catnap in closets.David Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference, ran through a litany of similarly dodgy long-term solutions, from safe lots to micro-apartments, and sounding frustrated, blurted out: “The alternative, of course, is actual affordable housing.”In the small city of O’Fallon, Missouri, is Mallory Box, 32, who lives 40 miles and two counties from her job in St. Louis. She commutes; it’s not a remarkable commute—she doesn’t qualify as a “super commuter,” that urban planning name for those increasingly common commuters who leave one urban core for another. But like many who drive to work in one of the 50 largest American cities, her commute has gotten worse—about 80 or 90 minutes—and she can’t quite afford much better. It’s a kind of not-really-crazy commute that, a generation ago, would have looked bananas. (Follow one man's daily, eight-hour commute.)“Welcome to the suburb of the suburb of the suburb,” she says at her front door.She leans in for a hug, to make her dog comfortable with a stranger, then steps back, revealing the pleasant, auburn glow of a middle-class home, a curio cabinet that traces her childhood to Texas, a well-appointed kitchen nicknamed “My Tuition”—meaning it’s what her parents would have spent on her if she hadn’t insisted they let her pay for college. She lives here with her wife—and father, who owns the house (and is now divorced). She slides cookies into a plastic bag, grabs her laptop bag, and we’re gone.Forty-five minutes later, we still haven’t reached St. Louis.It’s the first snowfall of the season, and lawns resemble Caesar salads. The highway is wide and, at 7:30 a.m., far busier than I would expect any highway near St. Louis to be. Though it’s lighter than normal, she says. It’s a Friday, a holiday weekend.“Typically, it’s bumper to bumper, but the snow...” It’s not because everyone is taking light rail. In fact, we’re driving to the closest station. “I have to own a car to get out of St. Charles County—I would prefer not to.” She could take a SCAT—the unfortunate moniker for St. Charles Area Transit buses—but she figures that would add another hour to her commute. She would prefer to simply live closer to a rail station, but before her current job, years of struggling to pay rent as a waitress and a bowling-alley events manager did a number on her finances. (Maps reveal how public transit can shape cities.)“There are times I think, Gosh, I wish I had my own place, but the money,” she says, pulling into a gas station. “Now that,” she says, staring at a big empty office park beyond the pumps, “that would make a perfect rail station for reaching St. Louis. She calculates in her head—“If there were a station here, I would save, three or four thousand a year.”Instead, we drive to the outskirts of St. Louis to board a train, moving through burned-out neighborhoods, gentrifying corners, across the Missouri River and industrial parks.Ninety minutes after leaving O’Fallon, we reach Citizens for Modern Transit in St. Louis, where Box works. Twenty-five years ago, the advocacy organization helped bring commuter rail to the city. Kim Cella, its executive director, joined then, partly inspired by accessibility issues—her brother had been paralyzed in a fraternity accident in college.I ask her why Mallory can’t get a rail station.Cella places her palms flat on the table. For an hour she lays out a Wire-like murk of social concerns only a David Simon could conjure. Decline in ridership, suburban concerns about security, lack of investment in the neighborhoods where transit stations already exist, a fundamental lack of support from the state for public transit in general—Missouri provides just $1.7 million for its 34 public transit systems. She describes a resistance to support for mixed-income dwellings in suburbs—similar to ordinances in other states that restrict construction of new mixed-income buildings near transit stations in wealthy communities, ensuring the burden of commuting stays on the less advantaged.She stops.Never mind the suburbs. Because of everything just explained, if you live in the city, especially if you are a person of color—say, a caregiver traveling to an elderly patient in a white community—your commute into those suburbs can stretch to two and a half hours. (Explore diversity in America, mapped block by block.)Elle Bernfeld and Mahin Manley hang out in their living room in Common Sterling, a dormlike affordable housing option for professionals in Brooklyn, New York.And there's a lack of support for rail stations in primarily white towns. “Everything we do we have to look at through a racial or social inequality lens,” she says. For instance, there is no rail station in Ferguson. Race, she says, “is the undertone of anything happening in this community now.” She says that transit is considered "dangerous," and points out that "a significant percentage of the population thinks the system is not for them.” And when she says it is? “Their heads...”She raises her fingertips from her skull in slow motion—her head is exploding.Mahin Manley arrived at Common Sterling in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn a year ago. She works as a data scientist for Capital One in Manhattan and could probably afford to live closer to Manhattan. And yet years of commuting every few weeks back and forth from North Carolina to care for ailing parents, and shouldering years of their medical bills—along with a creeping feeling, now in her early 40s, of staying light on possessions and flexible, and surrounded by a small community—led her to Common.First time she saw it, she cringed.“I wanted something in a certain price range, a reasonable commute into the city, and it was a longer commute than I had.” It was also a touch taller than the 99-cent store and brownstones alongside it. Painted black and white, it shouts, Hipsters Inside. “I was thinking gentrification—Oh, this is going to come in, change the tone of the neighborhood, push out people who have been here generations? I still don’t exactly know the answer.” And when she told co-workers about Common, she remembers puzzled looks.Sisters Rachel and Joy Kirkwood spend time in Rachel’s rental apartment in Oakland, California. Rachel works for Airbnb and is not sure if she will be able to afford rent once the discount period for her rented apartment ends.“You can see them thinking,” Manley recalls, “ ‘What mistake in her life did she make?’”Common is a “co-living” facility—say “dorm” or “group housing” around the people who operate Common and you see pain in their faces or hear a flinch in their replies. It is, said CEO Brad Hargreaves, a way of streamlining everyday roommate scenarios. And in places with the least affordable housing and worst commutes in the country, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and New York, it's something like a solution. For about $1,500 monthly, depending on the location, Common residents receive a small efficiency inside a larger home: rent, utilities, a bed, mattress, and regular amenities (such as toilet paper and garbage bags) are lumped into one sum.When I visited, I wore a button of a cryptic line drawing to alert the 15 or so residents, mostly in their 20s, that I was, I suppose, a certified outsider. Inside, the place was quiet, cute, the walls entirely white, with a whiff of transience. Manley sat on her bed surrounded by not much more than a stack of books on computer science. She held a six-month lease and had not hung a thing. She seemed amused by the place, and not at all uneasy with the connotations of group housing or shared living or whatever you want to call it. Depending on the train and when she left work, she had an hour commute with a seven-minute walk, but she saved money here, taking a $40 bus ride back to North Carolina every few weeks and basically having a modest adventure, she explained. She reached into her closest. Out spilled two suitcases, still mostly packed.To get in to the safe parking lot in San Diego, the form you need to fill out is a few pages long, with a list of rules and a three-line space where you explain your situation, why you’re there. I flipped through a form one morning, waiting for residents to wake. Their cars were Jeeps and Lexuses and VWs, two identical Priuses parked side by side. As they filtered out, they needed more than three lines to explain themselves. Many spoke in prepared speeches, the kind you hone sitting in your car for hours, day after day, feeling abandoned, fuming. A guy named Anthony Pechulis said that he couldn’t afford to live close to his work anymore, but he was headed there now. He held up a prepackaged egg, stamped “30 percent off.” A man named Eric Stevenson explained that he was on his way to a gym to shower before heading to work; he described a medical situation and a housing situation, and it all sort of sounded like a shipwreck.A man named John McCarthy removed a blue tarp from his windows and belted his pants. He put on his uniform for work, driving a bus for disabled people. His shirt had coffee stains. His car has 200,000 miles on it and needs a new starter. His rent went up $100, now he’s here.

"In 1925 Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect and pioneer of modernism, suggested razing the homes, statues, and streets of much of Paris’s Right Bank. In their place, he proposed erecting 18 identical glass towers some 650 feet high, a quarter of a mile apart, divided by lawns for pedestrians and elevated highways for cars.Le Corbusier contended that “lovers of antiques” and progressive thinkers were at war about how humans should live. A quote attributed to him leaves no doubt as to which side he was on: “Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the ‘new.’ ’’This battle has long raged in and about cities, which are thought to have first formed some 6,000 years ago in what is now Iraq. We question how best to live en masse, how to coexist. The answers change with our need for security, with passing fad and fancy, and with advances in technology.Should we live in dense urban areas with public transit and walkable amenities? In sprawling suburbs created by our infatuation with the car? In high-rises similar to those envisioned by Le Corbusier, now dotting urban districts across China? National Geographic has spent the past year exploring those questions for this month’s special coverage of cities. We sent photographers and writers across the globe to document how cities work, and don’t; from Tokyo—the planet’s largest metropolis with more than 37 million inhabitants—to Bidibidi, Uganda, essentially an instant city of more than a quarter million people, formed by refugees who’ve arrived since August 2016.We partnered with architectural firm SOM to create a detailed representation of the city of the future. And because we are National Geographic, we also covered an urban creature that follows us no matter what city we live in: rats.What does the future hold for cities and for the two-thirds of us who’ll live in them by 2050? While reporting our story “Rethinking Cities,” writer Robert Kunzig spent time with Jan Gehl, a Copenhagen urban designer who, Kunzig says, is “revered for his simple insights.” Let’s end with one: Gehl’s advice to be thoughtful about shaping cities, because we’re building a legacy.“Waking up every morning and knowing that the city is a little bit better than it was yesterday—that’s very nice when you have children,” Gehl says. “Think about that … your children have a better place to live, and your grandchildren have a better place to grow up than you could when you were young. I think that’s what it should be like.”We hope you enjoy this special issue about cities and our extended coverage on NationalGeographic.com.",
"Early on a cold June morning, I stood in darkness near the west bank of Tokyo’s Sumida River, watching tourists pull on bright nylon vests. They were green and glaring yellow, the sort of thing you’d wear in a pickup soccer game, as though the 70 shivering visitors from South Africa, China, Malaysia, Spain, and Russia had traveled all that way to chase balls along the gritty waterfront.It was an hour or two before dawn, and we were actually suiting up for a tour of Tsukiji Shijo, which at the time was the largest fish market in the world. Tsukiji was a labyrinth of warehouses, freezers, loading docks, auction blocks, and vendor stalls, and it had fed the city for nearly a century. It had also become—to the dismay of some who worked there—an attraction, promoted in countless articles and cable cooking shows.When I visited last year, though, the historic market was nearing the end of its run. The breezy stalls and cracked cobblestone floors lured tourists seeking authenticity, but in hypermodern Tokyo such things were officially seen as an unsanitary part of the unruly past. By autumn Tsukiji would close, its vendors moving from the heart of the city to a new, bland-looking facility to the southeast.We queued up to march inside. Fish scales glittered in puddles at our feet and the air tasted of oil and low tide. Forklifts and rattling ice carts flew past in all directions, like panicked birds. I realized our mesh vests were partly for safety—so we wouldn’t get squashed in the traffic—but also so we couldn’t sneak off and gum up Tsukiji’s lucrative flow.Each day, some 1,600 tons of fish, sea plants, and squirming invertebrates from all over the world poured into the market. At day’s end, that incredible haul, worth about $15 million, had been sorted, sawed into pieces, and shipped to retailers. By the time I’d arrived, at 4:30 a.m., the market had been roaring for hours.Hundreds of men hustled through the haze, laughing and shouting, cigarettes clamped between their teeth. White-gloved security guards directed us past a heap of Styrofoam boxes, some as big as coffins, their insides streaked with blood. Ahead, in a cavernous warehouse, saw blades screamed as they tore into frozen fish flesh.Most of the tourists had come for the famed tuna auctions, where giant fish from as far away as coastal Maine were sometimes sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. But compared to the circus we’d just walked through, the auction, when we saw it, was a yawn—a bunch of quiet guys quietly bidding up the price of high-end meals in Tokyo, Moscow, New York City.By 10 a.m. the action had ebbed and I slipped through the market alone, speaking with fishmongers who lamented the old market’s looming closure. Several hours later, only the delivery trucks still hummed, the drivers lounging in their cabs while forklifts packed fish into holds.Near midnight I wandered out to a small Shinto shrine where a row of stone monuments honored several species of edible sea creatures. Tsukiji had been Gothic, thrilling, obscene—a rare spot where Tokyo’s sleek modern facade fell away to reveal raw appetite—and I was exhausted.A cat brushed past my feet. The stone before me read sushi-zuka, “the monument to sushi.” In a few hours it would all begin again.If you agree with Harvard economist Edward Glaeser that cities are humanity’s greatest invention, then Tokyo is perhaps our greatest example: a stunning metropolis, home to more than 37 million people and one of the world’s wealthiest, safest, most creative urban centers.Even if you’re not particularly interested in how megacities shape human behavior, Tokyo is unavoidable—it has already changed your life. The city is the ultimate social influencer, the node through which the world connects to Japanese culture.Tokyo is there in your morning matcha latte, your afternoon bowl of miso, that dinner of sushi. You find it in your kid’s fascination with Totoro, Gundam, Pokémon, or Sony PlayStation 4. And it’s in the tiny cell phone camera you both can’t stop using.The city’s creativity can be traced, in part, to the fact that it’s been razed twice in the past 100 years—first by the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923, and a generation later by U.S. bombing raids during World War II. Each catastrophe forced the Japanese to bury history and rebuild, reimagining neighborhoods, transportation systems, infrastructure, even social dynamics. Tsukiji market itself was built in the aftermath of the Kanto quake, to replace one that had stood near the center of the city for 300 years.In the 1950s, Tokyo rebounded and grew incredibly dense. Glaeser suggests this is a reason for its success: the creative agitation that follows from cramming together people of diverse ages and backgrounds and stripping away barriers to trade and ideas. In an issue dedicated to cities, we couldn’t ignore Tokyo. And the writer Jane Jacobs, a major influence on urban planning, said that the best way to know a city, to feel its mashed-up power, is to walk it.So photographer David Guttenfelder and I did. For weeks we crossed and recrossed Tokyo, sometimes together, often apart; sometimes in a straight line, often leapfrogging from one area to another, working slowly through neighborhoods and industrial areas, school campuses, train stations, markets, graveyards, temples, and shrines. We had both lived previously in Japan, and we knew Tokyo could be buried beneath the superlatives used to describe it. We talked with nearly everyone we met, documented slivers of their routines and rituals. We couldn’t be comprehensive. But we could try to see more deeply, linking the city to the people who through their lives give it power.Some things hadn’t changed in 20 years. Police patrolled neighborhoods on white bicycles; kids barely bigger than their backpacks safely rode the subways alone. And most Tokyoites still live in Morse code rhythms, dashing between work and home on superefficient train lines. Just glancing at a map of the transit system conjures a diagram of neurons in the human brain. New York, where I live, has more stations, but each day some 10 million people ride Tokyo’s subways, more than New York City’s entire population.On a clear Saturday morning, I walked through Hachiyamacho, Uguisudanicho, and Ebisunishi, caught a Yamanote Line train at Shibuya, and took it to Ikebukuro, where I got out and kept walking. In the northern neighborhood of Sugamo, clerks were wrestling tables and clothing racks out onto the pavement along Jizo-dori, hoping to lure customers from a stream of mostly elderly, female pedestrians. There were sweaters for sale and necklaces, kitchen goods, orthopedic devices, canes, knee braces, adult diapers. But it was the underwear that stood out—bright red briefs and panties, neatly packaged, arranged by size.In Japanese culture, red is associated with good luck, good health, longevity.Older women in twos and threes strolled along, pulling through the racks, pausing here and there to tug at a waistband, check a price, buy a pair. Younger people flitted past the stands or slipped into a nearby coffee shop, but the crowd was mostly elderly, ojii-sans and obaa-sans, grandfathers and grandmothers.Cities often talk about themselves in terms of life, growth, youth—but old age and death are always there too, even when they’re largely ignored or treated as a matter of dull housekeeping. Harvard anthropologist Ted Bestor had pointed me toward Sugamo because here death is close to being on display. The neighborhood reveals a defining feature of Tokyo: its enormous, rapidly increasing elderly population.“In Tokyo they don’t try to hide the old people away,” Bestor said. “It can’t be done. There are just too many of them. So the old folks have their own district; they make their own fun.”Birth rates in most prosperous industrialized nations have declined substantially, but Japan is the most elderly of all. Nearly 30 percent of its population of 126 million is over 65. Deaths outnumber births. And while Tokyo is graying slightly less rapidly than the rest of the nation, its share of the burden will be enormous, leaving the city scrambling to decide how it will care for, pay for, and house the generations that built it.Aging is expected to drain the economy. But there’s a psychic cost too, illustrated most dramatically by kodokushi, a phenomenon often translated as “lonely death,” in which a person dies and remains undiscovered for days or weeks. By 2035 more than one-quarter of Tokyo will be over 65, and many of those people will live alone.In Sugamo, though, there was no sense of gloom or hopelessness. The crowd shopping for end-of-life care and crimson thongs flowed easily along Jizo-dori, laughing, arguing, shouting into mobile phones. Outside one shop a man and a woman gazed into the window, talking of robots. The Japanese government, which faces a labor shortage along with the aging problem, is subsidizing the development of robotic caregivers.“Can we buy one to take care of you yet?” he said gently. Beside him stood the elegant older woman wearing a wide-brimmed hat against the morning sun.“You’re stuck with me,” she said. “Those things are too scary.”Masanori Morishita is tall and thin, his dark hair thick and wild. He seems to vibrate, in the way of people driven by a slightly faster internal clock. Morishita is a serial tech entrepreneur and had recently sold his start-up, Everforth, to a larger technology company for a sizable sum. After the sale he stayed on to develop his product, and on the day I met him in the west-central neighborhood of Sendagaya, he was doing his best to fulfill another role: that of a visionary 30-something CEO who was relaxed enough to throw a barbecue for the company.It was held at Morishita’s new home, a narrow four-story stand-alone structure in a small cluster of houses near an old graveyard. Morishita had leased the home with plans to transform it into a live-work space where his engineers, sales team, and others could collaborate elbow to elbow. Offices were outfitted with whiteboards; there were bedrooms for employees, plus a wine cellar and a library, its shelves mostly bare.On the roof, Morishita flipped chicken over glowing coals (he had made the dressing for the salad himself) and outlined his plan to undermine traditional Japanese values with tech-inspired ones. It began with his house.“I like Silicon Valley culture,” Morishita said. “I’m trying to do that here, but it’s difficult.”He waved his tongs at the city.“Japanese culture, you know, it’s very strict. Ordered. Organized. People like to be told what to do.” The house, he said, and the new ways of living and working that it embodied were revolutionary.We looked at the skyline to the east, where cranes rose over the site of Japan’s new national stadium in the adjacent neighborhood of Kasumigaokamachi. It is the centerpiece of Tokyo’s redevelopment effort for the 2020 Summer Olympics and will seat 68,000 spectators for the event.The quiet neighborhood could be transformed by the nearness of the stadium, but Morishita was unconcerned. He was busy unplugging his work from the physical and social infrastructure that had held Tokyo together for decades—the crowded trains and roads, the obligatory after-work drinking parties, the stringent traditions that had, in his mind, prevented Japan from truly developing a Silicon Valley of its own.“What I really want is freedom,” Morishita said.A few weeks later, in a neighborhood called Asakusa on the other side of the city, I met with Kengo Kuma, the architect who designed the new national stadium. Kuma, one of Japan’s leading talents, is older by a generation than Morishita, but the two share a fundamental desire to remake the city.We sat in a small room on the third floor of the Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center, which, like nearly all the buildings Kuma has designed, is both hypermodern and surfaced in natural materials, in this case wood—a combination intended to lend warmth and presence while also paying homage to traditional Japanese craftsmanship.It was a hot, humid day, and I wanted to talk about the density I had been walking through. Kuma is sometimes taken for an anti-urbanist—opposed to the mass and hardness of cities—but he was quick to reject that label.“People say I’m a critic of cities,” he said, shaking his head. “I want to reshape the city. I want to break space up and return things to a smaller scale.” That smaller scale, he said, was once a defining feature of Japanese life, and would allow for more trees, gardens, parks—and more human connections.Kuma has designed hundreds of structures across Japan and in other countries, and I might have crossed Tokyo simply by neighborhoods that contain his work—an elegant udon restaurant fitted inside an old fireproof warehouse, a university computing center sheathed in cedar shingles, a cake shop covered with a lattice of timber that’s meant to suggest a forest.Of course the massive oval stadium will likely define him to future generations. But even that wears Kuma’s vision—a future in which structures are built for multiple uses over their lifetime and sit lightly on the landscape. After the Olympics his stadium will be converted for use as a soccer arena. It will sit in a grove of trees, and its several floors will be ringed with more greenery, planted around open-air walkways. The stadium’s roof is also open, allowing natural light to flood its interior.“We do have a density problem,” Kuma said. “Our urban design up until now was to find land and put a huge building on it ... Destroying everything to make way for skyscrapers and shopping centers—that has been the method in Asia.”Density intensified after the Kanto earthquake, he explained, and it increased again after the destruction of World War II. Many of the world’s great cities are ancient accretions, three-dimensional records of human behavior built up over centuries. But contemporary Tokyo was built quickly and haphazardly, its buildings, highways, and train lines pushed into blanks created by bombs and fire.The consequences, Kuma said, are revealed in some of Tokyo’s darkest contemporary problems, including kodokushi, the lonely death. He reached out and tapped a concrete pillar beside him.“My students prefer to live in shared houses now. That’s new ... That kind of lifestyle was abandoned after the war. We’ve been living in isolated spaces, separated by concrete. People don’t want to do that. They know it’s bad for them.”Kuma was animated, sketching with his hands as he described Tokyo. Many ideas he supports, from environmental sustainability to programs aimed at “returning nature to the city,” have slowly gained ground. When we later climbed to the tourist information center’s rooftop observation deck, Kuma described Japan as a “mature society”—wealthy, technologically advanced, and aging. Ready, in other words, to grow more responsibly.“The best thing we can do,” he said, “is set an example ... We can show how to do things differently.”The roof was packed with tourists photographing Tokyo’s skyline or gazing down over Senso-ji, a sprawling Buddhist temple complex that is no less superlative than the city itself; millions of pilgrims and tourists visit each year. Scents of sunblock, sweat, and incense rose up through the languid air.We watched crowds pouring into the temple through Kaminarimon, the “thunder gate,” just across the street. To the east a short dark building squatted on the opposite bank of the Sumida River. Part of Asahi Breweries’ world headquarters, it’s topped with an enormous golden plume that is said to represent a flame. A lot of people just call it “the golden turd.” Kuma grimaced.  Every building has a life, he said, and we should strive to be in harmony with it. “The position of [this one] is very important in front of the Kaminarimon gate. In designing it I want to show respect to the gate, the street .... Many people think history is history. Well, we live in a different age, but we’re still speaking with the past.”Toshio Tajima sat on the steps of the Shinto shrine in Minamisenju, a gritty neighborhood in east-central Tokyo, watching for his team of spirit-movers. It was a warm Friday in June, festival time, and traditional music—flutes, strings, drums—was blaring from loudspeakers mounted on telephone poles. Tajima, a large and serious man, was annoyed. Some 200 men were supposed to gather beneath the tall ginkgoes in the quiet courtyard, but only a dozen or so had showed and the local spirit, a deity named Susanoo, the storm god, was being made to wait.Tajima and the others were dressed traditionally and for teamwork, in identical happi jackets made of light cotton and wearing white jika-tabi, the split-toed shoes of the Japanese laborer. In anticipation of hard work, most also wore shorts, though a few guys had opted to gird their loins in a traditional fundoshi, a sort of jockstrap crossed with a thong.In one hand Tajima held a megaphone. The other he balled into a fist. He had short dark hair, a neat mustache, and a white bandanna knotted around his head. When he finally stood, out of restlessness, I noticed a weird lump at the back of his neck. It jiggled. Tajima caught me staring, and he tapped the lump. It jiggled some more.“That’s my mikoshi-dako,” he said, obviously proud.An older man stepped over and admired it.“It’s a huge one!” he said. Then he half-turned and pointed to his own slightly smaller lump. “Only dedicated men get these.”I’d never heard of a mikoshi-dako. Tajima explained that the word combines the terms for the portable shrine and “calluses,” though the lumps were nothing like any calluses I’d ever seen. They were squishy. A little gross. As I tried to imagine what could possibly cause them, the older man, Teruhiko Kurihara, laughed and pointed toward what looked like an oversize dollhouse set atop long, thick rails.“That’s the mikoshi,” he said. “You get the dako from carrying it.” He gave his callus a happy slap.The mikoshi was almost as big as a Mini Cooper, decked in gold hardware, sheathed in black and red lacquer. Paper screens filled the miniature windows, and hand-carved posts stood before hand-carved doors below a steeply pitched roof. It was a near replica of the actual shrine behind us, scaled down to portable dimensions. Every neighborhood in the area has its own portable mikoshi, and for the festival, Shinto priests had ceremonially transferred each neighborhood’s deity into their mikoshi.Soon about 40 men had arrived, all in identical outfits, and Tajima decided it was enough to get things moving. They gathered around the mikoshi and placed their hands on the smooth rails. At Tajima’s command they bent their knees, braced their shoulders, and lifted.Such festivals are common in Japan, and that afternoon I’d already seen other teams ferrying mikoshi down the streets, blocking traffic, pausing now and then for beer and snacks. For several days the mikoshi would float through their respective neighborhoods in a communal ritual meant to bring good luck and refresh ancient faith. On the last day—the big day—all the mikoshi would be hauled back to the local shrine. There’d be a huge party, Susanoo and the other spirits would be returned, and people would literally limp home.The mikoshi in front of Tajima wobbled upward onto the shoulders of its devotees, and they moved it across the courtyard, marching in practiced unison. When they reached a certain sacred spot, the procession stopped. Tajima yelled instructions, and the mikoshi began to rock, a gentle swaying at first, the men chanting and pushing. But slowly the shrine picked up momentum, and suddenly it was hurtling toward the ground, the men underneath certain to be crushed—until disaster was somehow averted and the shrine was thrown over to its other side. Back and forth it went, again and again, the shrine tossed like a boat on a seriously angry sea, battering necks and shoulders below.Tajima laughed at each near wreck. “Faster!” he shouted.Beneath the shrine, men grinned and groaned and heaved; the gravel at their feet grew dark with sweat.At my shoulder Kurihara said, “Our god likes it rough!” Then he asked, “Want to try?”He tapped a man out; I slipped in. Even with the entire team beside me, the burden felt personal. The mikoshi bit into my spine. It was easily a thousand pounds of bone-crushing wood, gold, and lacquer, and it punched me downward like a fence post. After a few minutes I had an apple-size bruise over my cervical vertebrae that would ache for a week. Kurihara tapped me out. I felt several inches shorter.“What’s inside that thing?” I said.Kurihara shrugged. He owned a nearby flower shop and had shared the suffering and joy of this tradition with his neighbors for more than 20 years.“It’s the spirit,” he said. “It’s really heavy.”Tajima’s team marched out of the courtyard and onto the streets of Minamisenju. White-gloved policemen held up traffic. Soon a crowd had gathered around the shrine, spilling out of homes and shops, people shouting support or jumping in for a turn. Every few minutes they would stop and shake the shrine, building momentum until it nearly toppled and dozens of hands reached up to stop the fall.Tokyo Prefecture’s governor, Yuriko Koike, admitted that she sometimes misses chaos.Koike, Tokyo’s first female governor, attended university in another massive metropolis—Cairo. It’s hard to imagine two places more utterly opposed, but for Koike, that was part of the allure.“What’s attractive about Cairo is that it’s chaotic,” she said, smiling at memories of hectic streets, the ancient souk. “But of course what’s attractive about Tokyo is that everything is controlled.”We were walking down a shaded gravel path in the central Hama-rikyu Gardens, a calm refuge of manicured lawns and flower beds with stands of black pines, crape myrtles, and cherry trees flush against the Sumida River.Koike had once been a news anchor, and she’d leveraged her Cairo experience into interviews with Arab leaders like Yasser Arafat and Muammar Qaddafi. In the 1990s she pivoted to politics and spent 24 years as a member of the national Diet, during which time she served in the cabinets of two prime ministers including serving, briefly, as Japan’s first female defense minister. She was elected governor in a landslide in 2016. The decisiveness of her victory suggested that the male monopoly on power might finally be slipping.Koike, who is often labeled a conservative, has spent much of her tenure fighting, or at least talking about, what she has called Japan’s “iron ceiling.” In office she has embraced environmental causes and urban sustainability, and like architect Kengo Kuma she seems to sense that Tokyo has reached a point of middle age from where it might begin a second act.The city is technologically and financially capable, Koike said, of making itself greener and preparing for technical details of future problems like, for example, sea-level rise. But social issues are slipperier.“What’s missing now in Tokyo is diversity,” she said. “And one of the pillars of a diverse city is to have more women involved.”Arriving from Brooklyn, I found Tokyo’s absence of diversity a regular, striking feature of my journey. Sizable populations of Koreans and Chinese live in Tokyo, and many of those families have been there for generations. The number of “international residents” has also increased over time—in 2018, one in 10 Tokyoites in their 20s were non-Japanese. But in a city so vast, those groups faded quickly, and diversity, whatever its form, remains an awkward subject in Japan.The nation’s rapid reinvention after World War II has often been attributed—by foreigners and Japanese alike—to its perceived homogeneity, a broad belief that Japan is ethnically and linguistically united, that together its people value harmony above all else, with good measures of obedience, loyalty, and self-sacrifice.These are risky notions, a list of model Asian behaviors perhaps better chalked up to a cartoon samurai. But some Japanese consider them to be sacred and even vulnerable qualities, the sorts of things an influx of outsiders would dilute, or destroy.Koike herself has been criticized for talking diversity without doing much to enable it. But her election itself was seismic and may yet prove part of a broader shift. The 2020 Olympic Games have provided motivation for Tokyo to move more quickly on diversity, Koike said. After all, tens of thousands of foreigners are expected to visit during the games, offering a chance to show off. And she understands that Tokyo’s composition will soon change no matter what. If nothing else, old age guarantees it.“Our biggest difficulty is how to handle the aging population,” she said. “But Tokyo is one of the centers for overcoming great challenges.” She adds that “resilience isn’t just Tokyo; it’s a Japanese characteristic. People are very serious, and they take things seriously.”A cool breeze lifted off the water, pushing away, for a few moments, the heavy damp air and ruffling nearby pines. In the distance, cargo ships blared their horns.The governor said her day had so far been consumed with the shutdown of Tsukiji market.There were problems. It was complicated. Just another superlative project in the superlative city.We walked back across the park to her small white van. Koike has been active in Tokyo for nearly 40 years and is presiding over immense transformation—less dramatic than war or fire but equally profound. Cities tend toward disorder, and in a way Koike’s job is to remember how chaos so recently consumed Tokyo. Then she is compelled to spend her days keeping it at bay.I asked how she thought the city had changed over her lifetime. It was a standard journalist’s question, one she herself had probably asked many times during her earlier career. The governor laughed.“I know it has changed, but sometimes it feels as if it hasn’t,” she said. “When you are part of the story, sometimes it’s hard to see.”",
"Tsukiji is a fish market in the sense that the Grand Canyon is a ditch or Caruso was a crooner. Among the wholesale fish markets of the world, Tsukiji ranks at the top in every measurable category. It handles more than 400 different types of seafood, from penny-per-piece sardines to golden brown dried sea slug caviar, a bargain at (U.S.) $473 a pound. It imports from 60 countries on six continents.Frozen assets, bluefin tuna worth top yen are readied for Tsukiji's morning auction. The market's clamorous labyrinth of stalls showcases all manner of seafood—from live sea eel to pickled octopus—and reflects the well-ordered confusion of Japanese society. Says Tsukiji scholar Ted Bestor, "Tsukiji reveals as much about Japanese culture as it does about Japanese cuisine."— From "Tsukiji: The Great Tokyo Fish Market," November 1995, National Geographic magazine",
"More people live in cities than ever before. According to the United Nations Population Fund, over half of the world’s citizens now live in an urban area—a figure expected to reach nearly 70 percent by 2050. Globally, one in eight of those city dwellers lives in a megacity, defined by the UN as a place with more than 10 million people.That’s why I started this series, which I call “Metropolis.” I wanted to focus on the UN statistics—and show what they actually look like. So from 2007 to 2015 I photographed megacities and documented the dynamic process of urbanization.I asked myself several questions: How can people live in cities that are so crowded, hectic, and chaotic? What are the differences among these megacities? And what do they have in common?Crowds pack Piccadilly Circus in London, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city. After, many visitors will migrate over to West End theaters and high-end shopping on Regent Street.Protestors, vendors, and worshippers mingle after prayers in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt, nearly a year after the start of the Arab Spring demonstrations in 2011.I try to expose the contrasts between wealth and poverty, traditional culture and cutting-edge development. I’m fascinated that so many people can coexist in such crowded places. There’s never enough space. But there’s also a current of inventiveness, a sense of community.Whenever I work in a new city, I enlist a local assistant. We discuss which locations we should visit, and if a spot looks good, we find a high vantage point. Then it becomes a waiting game.To visualize the speed of urban life and capture its energy, I use long exposure times. It’s important to know which elements in the frame are moving and which are still. There has to be a balance—a harmony in the chaos.All my photos are shot on film. My aim is to encapsulate megacity life in a single photograph—one panoramic, kaleidoscopic image. All the photos in this series are multilayered: The longer you look, especially at large prints, the more you see. I’ve pored over these pictures a thousand times, but I still manage to find new stories and elements each time. I hope you will too.People gather under the blossoming trees of Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires to march in the annual Gay Pride parade.

"Standing in a sliver of shade cast by a solar streetlamp, David Kwaje plugs statistics into his smartphone.Hidden from the harsh midday sun, he can see downhill to a row of white warehouses where residents collect food rations and beyond to two large tanks that supply water to roadside taps, yellow jerry cans radiating in all directions.All week Kwaje has been walking along dirt roads, plotting every business, church, school, clinic, water tap, and light source on a digital map. At each stop he marks the location and asks detailed questions: Does your school have running water? What hours is this store open? How many doctors does the clinic have? By the time he and a half dozen other mappers finish, they’ll have created an open-source guide to an area that’s more than twice the size of Paris.This is Bidibidi. With a quarter million people living in its many villages in northern Uganda, it’s the second largest refugee settlement in the world, after the Rohingya camp in Bangladesh.Kwaje, who is 26, arrived two years ago. Around him a forest was razed and 250 miles of roads were carved through head-high grass and over streams to make room for a flood of South Sudanese fleeing war just a few hours north. He and his family built a cluster of mud-brick homes on a plot of land. He got married and had a son. Now, for the nonprofit Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, he’s documenting Bidibidi’s transformation from temporary camp to permanent city.With a single earbud in, Kwaje crosses the road to one of Bidibidi’s five secondary schools. Thick tree limbs are enclosed by plastic tarps with window cutouts flapping in the wind. Kwaje is string bean tall and talkative, with a restless energy. But the day has been long, and as he walks across a rock-strewn courtyard, he’s overtaken by a heat-induced apathy—until he catches sight of a young man in a gray dress shirt. “This was my teacher in South Sudan!”He jogs over for a hug then folds his gangly frame into a chair, pulls out his phone, and drills Soko Khamis, his former high school teacher and now the Bidibidi school’s academic director, with a series of questions, each punctuated by a finger snap: When did this school open? (February 2017.) Is this structure temporary? (Yes.) What are the challenges? (The bathrooms are falling apart. The students are hungry. Books are in short supply.)“When are you going back to our school?” he asks.“Ah,” Khamis sighs. “There is still war there.”A great experiment is under way in Uganda. An industrial skyline of water and cell towers hovers over sturdy mud huts and small farm plots. Schools and health centers are built from brick, slathered in concrete, and fitted with glass windows. Taps run freshwater, and small solar panels power streetlights, as well as radios blasting music from barbershops, televisions airing soccer matches in community halls, and cell phones snaking from charging stations in shops.In camps around the world, refugees live crammed in tents, makeshift shelters, or metal dwellings. They’re restricted by laws that make work and movement outside the camps impossible. Even in well-planned camps such as Azraq in Jordan’s desert, the starkness of life without jobs or a sense of belonging sends refugees back to Syria or forces them to try to earn money in dangerous, under-the-table arrangements.In Uganda, under one of the world’s most progressive policies, those who’ve fled civil war in South Sudan can live, farm, and work freely. Here, Bidibidi’s future is discussed at the highest levels of government and the international community. The goal: To build a livable city out of a refugee camp, one that might endure even if the refugees can return home someday.Consider that Venice was founded in the fifth century by refugees fleeing war on the mainland, and Palestinian camps founded 50 years ago are indistinguishable from other neighborhoods in the Middle East, and it seems feasible that a refugee crisis could birth a permanent—perhaps even a beautiful—city. Most camps worldwide are still built as temporary way stations. Speed and survival take priority, and aid groups, host countries, and refugees themselves hope they’ll return home soon. The reality is different: Refugees stay in exile for an average of 10 years. As the world grapples with record-breaking displacement, maintaining temporary camps is costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year and suspending the lives of millions of people.In December 2013, two years after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan, conflict between rival government leaders erupted into civil war. A peace deal paused the fighting, but in July 2016 the agreement crumbled. As indiscriminate killing swept the country, tens of thousands of people escaped to Uganda. Bidibidi opened that August, and almost immediately 6,000 people a day began arriving.A month later, all 193 United Nations member states pledged to integrate refugees more fully into their societies. Thirteen countries, including Uganda, are piloting this strategy. But it’s hardly revolutionary in Uganda, where refugees have been allowed to live and work for a decade. In 2017, Uganda launched an effort to encourage development in refugee-hosting areas.Uganda has transformed the majority of Bidibidi’s schools and clinics into permanent structures and installed a water system. Unlike many refugee camps, which are isolated and gated, Bidibidi merges almost seamlessly into its surroundings. The refugees’ homes, surrounded by corn, peanuts, and sesame plants, are nearly identical to those in the Ugandan villages between the camp’s five zones. When—or if—the South Sudanese go home, Ugandans will use the new schools, health clinics, and piped water.“We may not have serious infrastructure like other cities, but I believe that those who saw New York within two years of its formation wouldn’t say it was much better than Bidibidi,” says Robert Baryamwesiga, the Ugandan official who established the camp and continues to oversee it. “If we are given that time, we can also make a very big city.”It's Wednesday at 4 p.m., and a meeting at the Ministry of Useless Affairs is called to order. Henry Anguyo, in a neat plaid button-down, presides from a plastic chair next to a shack on the side of a long dirt road. Two dozen members sit in chairs and on the ground.A city is forming around them, and like residents everywhere, they want to have their say. The ministry is a kind of civic club started by frustrated refugees seeking to improve conditions. Many inhabitants feel ignored by the camp bureaucracy and can’t afford even basic supplies such as soap and shoes. The ministry has sought to tackle issues like unemployment, broken water taps, and pregnant women being hassled during monthly food-ration distributions. Someday the group hopes to have done enough to change the ministry’s name to “Useful.”Anguyo was a teacher in South Sudan, and his patience comes in handy as the complaints pile up. He listens for a while with a serene smile before interjecting: “Now, what are solutions?”Early on, aid workers saw long-term potential in Bidibidi. Miji Park, who was setting up programs for Mercy Corps, was impressed by how quickly a market popped up near the reception area. “From the very beginning you could see the future,” she recalls. “It was clear there’d be huge economic growth.”But in Bidibidi, a medical technician can find himself hawking papaya and passion fruit, while a nurse makes a living selling shards of plastic bottles covered with fabric scraps as earrings. Bidibibi’s inhabitants live in subsistence limbo. If the economy doesn’t get a jump start, they’ll return to South Sudan or leave the camp for another city in search of work.Long-term stability means shifting the refugee-camp paradigm from humanitarian aid toward private industry. A California-based think tank called Refugee Cities is lobbying refugee-hosting governments to build development zones that could draw foreign investment. “If you create the legal space in which economic activity is allowed and people are given basic legal stability, you can unleash tremendous dynamism that ultimately creates prosperity,” founder Michael Castle Miller says. “Not just for people there—but throughout the country.”Blueprints and budgets drafted by various humanitarian organizations show how economic development might come to Bidibidi: Wi-Fi zones, mini-electrical grids, large-scale production facilities. For now, business is small-scale, and private companies are only starting to think about how to tap Bidibidi’s idle labor force.Driven out of South Sudan by war, refugees try to make the best of what little they have in the camp. From mud cell phones to cardboard toy trucks, children fashion their own ingenious entertainment out of available materials.In a tarp-covered workshop, two refugees pound a pulpy biomass mixture into small cakes and lay them out to dry in a greenhouse next door. Every morning jumpsuit-clad workers carry a stack of cakes, 25 cents each, to nearby houses. In small kitchen huts, customers light a special stove and insert the briquette—an eco-friendly solution to the demand for wood to fuel cookstoves. For the rest of the day a large pot of beans or rice simmers on top.Pamela Komuhendo, a red beanie pulled over her braids, describes the challenges facing Raising Gabdho, the briquette company she cofounded three years ago in Kampala. It grew so quickly that new customers are now accepted only by referral. Bidibidi presents a new hurdle: There’s little infrastructure to support new business. Despite this, Raising Gabdho has decided to build a plant and an 11-kilowatt solar mini-grid that could help launch 40 to 50 new businesses.“There are people planning to settle here,” Komuhendo says. “Even if there’s peace in South Sudan, they’ll stay here if they’re making money.”On a busy market street where people come for a haircut, a warm beer, or to catch a soccer match, Patrick Aleko irons church logos and team names onto T-shirts in his solar-powered graphic design shop. He ran a similar business in South Sudan. The pink and blue structure is the sturdiest on the block, and inside he teaches kids design on two computers. When he put up his concrete building, the neighbors chided him: You’re wasting money—next year we’ll be back in South Sudan. Now they’re tearing down their tarps and buying bricks.As the sky darkens, Aleko moves outside and perches on a wooden stool. “I’ll be the last person here,” he says, a security light casting a glare over the emptying market. “I’ll close my doors and say goodbye to Bidibidi when it’s just dogs in the street—when there are no more customers.”What, he wonders, will happen to the camp if South Sudan achieves peace? Will the Ugandan government be able to maintain what’s been built, or will millions of dollars of infrastructure rot in the forest? He knows what he thinks the answer should be. “Bidibidi will become a role model,” he exclaims. “Let it become a permanent settlement.”Dozens of nongovernmental organizations are working to improve life for refugees in Bidibidi in northern Uganda, the second largest refugee settlement in the world.

"Shershah, 15, from Afghanistan, peers out from below a bright blue blanket in an abandoned train car in the central railway station of Belgrade, Serbia where he has found some semblance of shelter and rest. Recent years have seen a jump in the number of unaccompanied children fleeing to Europe in an attempt to escape hardship and conflict.Migrants from Africa and Middle East braving the deadly waters of the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe have made for heartbreaking headlines in recent years. But a different element of the global refugee crisis has been growing for decades, far from the media spotlight.More than 13 million people are trapped in the limbo defined by the United Nations as “Protracted Refugee Situations”— where 25,000 or more refugees have lived for five or more years in an asylum country. They can be found in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, and South America, in host countries where a refugee’s temporary stay has turned into a prolonged state of crisis.According to the United Nations’ Refugee Agency, some 68.5 million people are displaced worldwide, including 25.4 million people who have left their home countries as refugees. Nearly nine of out ten of them now live in developing countries where education, health, and employment resources are already under pressure.Over two million Afghan refugees are now divided between Iran and Pakistan, for example, a cumulative sum first stemming from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.Egypt has the longest protracted refugee situation of all, hosting refugees from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. For those refugees, and for so many others, their journey has no clear end in sight.",
"Bidibidi, UgandaThey hear our car before they see it speeding down the main road enveloped in a cloud of red dust. The dust is so thick a few days later I see a young girl swipe some and paint it on her mouth like lipstick. By the time we pull under the shade of a tree, the children are ready, small clay figurines in hand, for their photoshoot. They offer them nervously at first, then boastfully. Toy-less children run off and quickly return with mounds of clay being furiously molded into cars, limbs, and other shapes.These kids would have been the first generation to grow up in an independent South Sudan, if war hadn’t so quickly dispelled them. Today, more than 1 million children have fled the country, building new lives in refugee camps scattered in Uganda and other neighbors of South Sudan. Even in the most remote places, kids learn how to entertain themselves and for the nearly 200,000 children living in Bidibidi the malleable red dirt provides something to play with.Dragging handmade cardboard trucks and cars, Peter Mandela (left), Wane Samuel and Cosmas Amule (center), and Joghua Burkene (right) pose in Bidibidi. The majority of the camp's occupants are children.Bibibidi, a sprawling settlement in northern Uganda, holds a quarter-million South Sudanese refugees. Zone 5 is the furthest away from the original camp center, more than an hour from the first zone where the UN and humanitarian organizations make their base. And village 19, where we’ve just arrived, is nearly on the edge of the London-sized camp.Bidibidi refugee settlement opened in 2016, as thousands of South Sudanese fleeing civil war entered Uganda.Photographer Nora Lorek and I have come to this village to meet with a group of South Sudanese women making decorative bed sheets called milaya, their eye-popping bird, flower, and tree designs all embroidered by hand. In South Sudan, women learn the craft from their mothers and grandmothers, stashing away boxes of them for dowries or to decorate the house on special occasions. Each one can take weeks or months to sew, the women bent over little circles of taut fabric surrounded by embroidery hoops. Now, the task is done mostly out of habit, or maybe boredom; in Bidibidi there are few customers. The milayas decorate outdoor churches and courtyards hosting funerals. The mothers sew while their kids go to school, fetch water, and shape new toys for their collection.Nearby, Nora spots a little boy playing with a toy shaped out of deep brown mud. She asks to take his picture, and he stands against the similarly colored backdrop of a nearby hut with his hand outstretched to display the toy. Other kids come with trucks crafted out of World Food Program boxes, plastic bottle cars, and various electronics shaped out of mud. In the remote camp, where there's little to buy and do, kids have made their own entertainment.Cardboard boxes from shipments of humanitarian supplies get a second chance as toy cars, trucks, and buses.Our translator, a 24-year-old named Asha who seems to be related to half the camp, tells us she and her brother would spend hours making mud toys as children in South Sudan. They’d carefully craft them only to pound them flat and remold them into something new. When she was older her mother taught her to sew milaya, and that creation she still has: a pink sheet with purple, yellow, and red flowers flanked by bundles of leaves.A young boy plays with a plastic bag attached to string.James Lokusan, 10, pulls a toy truck over the bumpy dirt road in Bidibidi.If you ask the residents of Bidibidi what they took when they left South Sudan, most say they threw a few possessions into a bed sheet, locked their home, and started walking. On the road to Uganda, Asha told us that kids would die of exhaustion or malnutrition and parents would bury them under piles of leaves under trees. When they’d stop for the night to sleep she feared accidentally laying down on top of a dead child.In 2011, South Sudan was declared the world’s newest country after a half-century of war against northern Sudan. Hopes for the hard-won freedom were short lived. The country exploded into civil war in 2013 and again in 2016. Racing a massacre, people streamed over the border with Uganda. In August, 6,000 refugees were arriving per day. A thick forest sprinkled with mud-hut villages transformed into the world’s largest refugee camp. Today, Bidibidi is second in size only to Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, with some 225,000 residents.In Uganda, unlike most of the world, temporary citizens have the right to work and get an education. Because of this progressive refugee policy, the camp looks nothing like the tent-cities you might find is refugee crises elsewhere. Families live in clusters of huts with small plots of corn, rice, and vegetables. Most of the water comes out of taps; more than half of the schools are permanent structures; and brick-and-mortar health clinics are under construction.Susan James, 10, holds her clay doll.Simon Ayole, 13, attached strands of braided hair to his clay doll.So, the residents live in safety but poverty. Homes are filled with handouts from NGOs: a thin foam mattress, plastic chairs, and solar-power lamps. There’s little to buy: market stands sell pieces of soap and warm soda. Anything extra is handmade, but the kids have adapted by using the material that’s most plentiful: dirt. Now we’ve arrived to admire their ingenuity. Asha pulls them one by one in front of the camera and pushes back the circle of gawkers as it threatens to block the afternoon light.A cellphone, a radio, and a helicopter, all made of mud, showcase the ingenuity of Bidibidi's youngest residents.A couple days later, the children hear our car arrive again to the village and get into formation. Dozens line the roadside where we pull over in front of a small tea shop. By the time we gather our bags and open the door we’re bombarded with the latest creations: a clay man pushing a wheelbarrow with toothpick handles. A doll with wild black hair sprouting from its head. A tiny helmeted rider crouched on a motorcycle with wheels held together by stick axles.A boy with a life-size clay gun holds it gingerly for Nora’s camera as Asha ushers the rest into line behind her. The kids press tightly together, laughing and yelling. Some are still putting the finishing touches on their creations. At the end of the line, a boy in a plaid shirt with a wide smile lingers behind the rest as he works a fresh piece of round clay into something new.Basir's doll, pictured on the left, and a doll made by 10-year-old Abudui Ino on the right.A box of laundry soap turns into a truck in the hands of 11-year-old Martin Salah.Two boys play with a handmade truck in the fields of Bidibidi.",
"They are on a boat dock, hands coated with the innards of a yellowfin tuna, when Konini Rongo and Bella Smith learn that they live in one of the world’s largest shark sanctuaries.The girls, both 17, are chopping up scraps next to a row of fishing boats at a port on Rarotonga, the biggest of the 15 Cook Islands. They volunteered to help American marine biologist Jessica Cramp place underwater cameras to spot sharks. But first comes the messy task of making bait, as Cramp, a veteran National Geographic explorer, tells them the story of the 484-million-acre protected area.In 2012 the Cook Islands became one of the world’s 17 shark sanctuaries, which protect a collective 7.5 million square miles of ocean. Its regulations, including those listed below, attempt to curtail the killing of sharks, estimated at tens of millions annually.Forbidden Fishing: Bans vessels operating within the nation’s exclusive economic zone from targeting sharks.Fines: Levies a fine of $73,000 to $182,000 on any boat found with shark parts on board.Wire Ban: Forbids trace wire, a type of fishing line that often ensnares sharks.In 2011 Cramp moved to the South Pacific islands, where the reefs teem with sharks, to help launch a campaign for the sanctuary. Eighteen months later it was law, with a minimum $73,000 fine levied on any boat found selling or transporting shark parts in the Cook Islands’ exclusive economic zone.She now lives in a stilt house on Rarotonga, an island of jagged peaks encircled by a ring of white sand. It has a little more than 10,000 residents and two buses—one labeled “Clockwise” and the other “Anti-Clockwise”—that transport them on the road wrapping around the island.Now Cramp plans to insert satellite tags into the backs of 28 sharks so she can follow their movements. Little is known about the region’s sharks, and Cramp wants to find out where and how far they’re traveling—vital data for designing better protections.Cramp loads a fish-filled cooler, shark hooks, and a carefully wrapped satellite tag onto the boat. Then she shows the teens the drill: how to attach a GoPro camera and bait stick to a device that will moor them to the ocean floor and how to log the GPS coordinates so they can pull it up later. For her research project tagging sharks, she explains, they’d hook the animal, rope it to the side of the boat, cut a slit at the base of its dorsal fin, and slide in a satellite tag. Then every time it broke the surface, Cramp would be able to follow the shark’s migration. The girls look horrified.“It sounds brutal, but it’s going to give us information to make policies that protect them,” Cramp says. “One of the reasons we’re studying sharks is because they’re in trouble, and we want to know if the laws we have in the Cook Islands work.”Before the sanctuary was created, a vessel could easily catch five or six sharks a day, says Josh Mitchell, who oversaw commercial fisheries for the Ministry of Marine Resources. His inspectors could smell ammonia, which seeps out of sharks’ skin, as soon as they boarded a boat. Often the crew would sell the fins in parts of Asia where shark-fin soup is a delicacy.When the zero-tolerance policy went into force in 2012, the inspectors were relieved, Mitchell says, because it left no room for interpretation. Since then four boats have paid a total of $247,000 in fines (one lower fine was levied on a local boat).A college professor once told Cramp that the best scientists spend their entire lives trying to disprove their own theories. So for three years Cramp has been crunching global data to evaluate whether large-scale protected areas like the one she helped design are keeping sharks alive. She hopes this information will instruct conservationists and lawmakers on developing more effective policies.“I just know sharks are still dying within sanctuaries,” says Cramp. “And if they don’t work, then all the political will, all the kudos, all the momentum, is for nothing.”She’s come to realize that even when the law seems absolute, there are gray areas. In multiple instances Cook Islands authorities haven’t fined a boat with shark parts on board because it was just passing through the nation’s waters or had entered to request medical assistance. (Look inside a shark feeding frenzy.)Traditionally sharks were an animal guardian, a taura atua, to Cook Islanders. But to modern-day commercial fishermen, they’re the competition. Fishermen lure their catch with debris and rope that dangle under buoys a few miles offshore—but this also attracts hungry sharks. This has become a battlefield for Cramp’s conservation efforts. “The mentality here is, if you’re getting sharked, go catch a shark,” says a local skipper.A few days before the camera-drop trip, Cramp stops by the port looking for bait. “You guys catching anything today?” she asks a group of fishermen gathered around a picnic table. “Seen any sharks?” The answer is no to both, but Cramp has heard that one of them recently killed a shark, and she confronts him. “It was messing with me!” he hollers back.Cramp has a reputation in the port; fishermen call her the shark lady. She tries not to lecture this one about the kill—just say enough that it sticks in his head. “He will start to kill fewer sharks,” she says, “because he’ll feel bad.”Later Cramp notes the long hours that go into community-centric research. “It would be a lot easier to fly in, do some research, and make it seem like I made a big difference,” she says. But in those cases “you leave with success and come back and nothing’s changed.” Instead she’s made getting local buy-in the backbone of her efforts—and that’s why she’s trying to inspire young Cook Islanders to pursue marine biology.On boat rides to place and retrieve the GoPros, Cramp’s young helpers don’t see any sharks to tag. The next day they watch the GoPro footage: fish sucking on the bait stick, eels battling in front of the camera. Two hours in, Cramp spots something circling in the background: “There’s a shark!” High fives all around. “That was my camera drop,” Rongo says proudly.Cramp keeps a short list in her head of young Cook Islanders with the interest and motivation to do this type of conservation and envisions someday passing her work on. Rongo and Smith, both high school seniors, are considering going to college for marine biology.“Instead of saying, ‘I work in an office,’ you’d be like, ‘I’m a shark lady,’” Smith muses. “That’d be such a cool name to have.”",
"On her first day in the sprawling South Sudanese settlement of Bidibidi in Uganda, home to almost 300,000 refugees, Swedish-German photographer Nora Lorek approached a woman and asked what she’d brought from home. “Nothing,” she replied, “except for some clothes wrapped in my bedsheet.” Lorek scribbled, “bedsheet???” in her notebook.Civil war between the north and south has plagued Sudan on and off since the 1950s. In 2011, South Sudan separated from Sudan and became the world’s newest country. Soon after, in 2013, a power struggle erupted between leaders, and the country plunged into civil war. There were periods of quiet, but in 2016, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of independence, a peace deal fell apart and war resumed.Every day thousands of refugees streamed across the border into Uganda, where they’re allowed to work, farm, and go to school. For some it was their second, third, or fourth time fleeing home. Bidibidi soon became one of the world’s largest refugee settlements. In August 2017 the millionth refugee arrived since fighting started in 2013. Uganda has one of the world’s more progressive refugee policies, but the number of new arrivals threatened to strain its hospitality.Three generations of women pose in front of their milaya. Emelda Benjamin (right) stitched the cloth in South Sudan.Emelda Benjamin and her sisters display another milaya their family brought from South Sudan.Rebecca Ameri, 75, is surrounded by her grandchildren. Long before South Sudan broke from Sudan, she was a soldier fighting for independence.When Lorek asked around about the sheets, Bidibidi’s residents pulled out their milayas: cloths covered in ornately sewn birds, flowers, and designs. The women had learned to make them from their mothers and grandmothers. The sheets covered beds, hung on walls, and were often included in dowries.Lorek asked the women to pose in front of their sheets. “Building up these studios in their temporary homes gave me the opportunity to see more of their real home—South Sudan—even though they had to leave so much behind,” she says.For many refugees, the milayas are the only thing left from home—and a means to make a meager living. Rose Jaun, 38, arrived from South Sudan with six children and two bedsheets. Her mother taught her how to make them, and in turn she taught her daughters. In Bidibidi she started a collective for women to sew and sell milayas.“When you’re getting married and your husband is coming to your home, you have to put the milaya high up on the house so everybody can see it,” Jaun told Lorek. “Here the making of bedsheets is only for us. It gives us time to talk and share thoughts, and an income.” Sixty women produced two a week until a fabric shortage slowed them down. Many of them also work as bricklayers to get by.Women in the settlement told Lorek of men shot and children lost as they tried to escape. In many cases, their husbands were killed or stayed behind to fight or protect their land in South Sudan. Now the women take care of their own children and foster others by themselves.After multiple failed attempts by both sides to maintain peace, returning home feels like a distant hope for refugees. One mother told Lorek, “We’re staying here on our own because there’s no way of going back without peace.”",
"Watching Jiang Wannian and Ping Cuixiang harvest a sixth of an acre of daikon seed in the north-central province of Gansu feels a little like traveling back in time.In a dry valley ringed by dusky mountains, on a brick-paved lot, Jiang drives a rusted tractor over a hip-deep mound of dried plants. As they crush down, Ping, Jiang’s wife, plunges a homemade pitchfork into the straw and arranges it for another pass. Eventually Jiang and Ping work side by side, wiry figures with tawny skin. It’s hot, but they are swaddled in clothes to protect themselves from the dust and the sun. They have handsome faces, taut and lined from years of laboring outdoors, and they turn them skyward as they throw fine chaff up and watch ruddy seed rain down. This rhythm continues for hours. In a singsong voice Ping encourages the wind, murmuring, “Blow, blow!” Machines can do this work in minutes, but they are too expensive for Jiang and Ping. Instead they still thresh the daikon by hand, just as farmers did centuries ago.Jiang and Ping represent one story of China and its farms. More than 90 percent of all farms in China are less than 2.5 acres, and the average farm size is among the smallest in the world. But this is not the only story. Over the past four decades China has caught up to the agricultural development that took the Western world 150 years to achieve—and reimagined it to boot. Every kind of agriculture is now happening all at once: tiny family farms, gleaming industrial meat factories and dairies, sustainably minded high-tech farms, even organic urban ones.China is grappling with a daunting conundrum: how to feed nearly one-fifth of the world’s population with less than one-tenth of its farmland, while adapting to changing tastes. Thirty years ago about a quarter of the country’s people lived in cities, but by 2016, 57 percent of the population was urban, living in a China that is wealthier and more technologically advanced, with a diet that increasingly resembles that of the West. The Chinese eat nearly three times as much meat as in 1990. Consumption of milk and dairy quadrupled from 1995 to 2010 among urban residents and nearly sextupled among rural ones. And China now buys far more processed foods, increasing about two-thirds from 2008 to 2016.Because China’s agricultural resources are so modest, supplying this new diet means heading abroad, leading the government to encourage—and help—Chinese companies to acquire farmland and food companies in places like the United States, Ukraine, Tanzania, and Chile. But China has long prized self-sufficiency in staple grains, as an ideology and a response to political isolation, and this has implications for fields at home too. In 2013 President Xi Jinping, discussing food policy with rural officials, told them, “Our rice bowl should be mainly loaded with Chinese food.” This raises a tricky question: If the Chinese are going to feed themselves and eat more like Americans, what does that mean for the way they farm?The mismatch between agricultural supply and demand in China can seem insurmountable. There are 334 million acres of arable land, of which roughly 37 million are polluted or set aside for restoration. There are 1.4 billion people to feed, but the giant farms that fuel Western diets are nearly impossible to replicate here. That is partly because much of China’s terrain is mountains or desert but also because the farmland is split among about 200 million farms. China’s agricultural landscape looks less like a blanket of green than a patchwork quilt.Jiang and Ping’s patches adjoin their village—mud-walled houses arrayed in clutches along paved streets that dead-end in cornfields. Their area is known as Team Seven, a remnant of the collective period under Mao Zedong, when the state told farmers what to farm and took most of what they produced. Jiang and Ping lived through the great famine in the late 1950s and early 1960s; Jiang can recall eating boiled bark and leather belts when food ran out. After the collective system ended in 1981, the state kept ownership of the land but distributed the rights to cultivate it equally among villagers.That process gave Jiang and Ping less than three acres divided among four sites. They dispatch their daughter, a 36-year-old tour-company worker visiting her parents from Kunming, 1,200 miles away, to show me their farm. Under hot, clear skies Jiang Yuping, wearing white jeans, knockoff Vans, and a melon-colored off-shoulder blouse, leads me to the end of the street. I see a tiny, mud-walled building adjacent to an irrigation canal and ask why an outhouse is placed so close to water. She blinks. “It’s like a temple for worship,” she says, eyeing me skeptically. As I apologize, she turns to point out her family’s stevia fields, an acre patch of short, emerald-hued plants bound for sweetener. We walk farther, and she shows me the family’s half acre of flaxseed, planted beneath a factory’s spindly chimney. A couple kilometers down a two-lane highway are the daikon, lettuce, and corn plots. Later she talks about her parents and how she wishes their farm could be more like an American one. “Look at China: Most land is difficult to manage,” she tells me. “There is a waste of human labor and resources.”The small fragmented nature of Chinese farms is the crucial difference from Western ones, and it’s antithetical to the way much of the industrialized world produces food. If China is to meet its changing appetites with domestic crops, “there are a number of changes that we need,” says Huang Jikun, an agricultural economist at Peking University. Irrigation must be upgraded, he says, and technology and mechanization need to expand. But the first thing that feeding China from home requires, he says, is enlarging the country’s small farms.The solution might seem simple: replace the patchwork quilt with a vast blanket that can be mowed down in one fell swoop. But Huang cautions that big isn’t always best. China’s staple crops of corn, rice, and wheat all yield the most food per acre at modest scales: One study suggested the sweet spot is between five and 17 acres. “If you’ve got a very small farm, a farmer is out there weeding and working very intensely,” notes Fred Gale, a senior economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and crop yields per acre will reflect that, often being higher than if a large machine is used. China’s plan is not to merge the holdings of small farmers like Jiang and Ping into Kansas-style farms. That would be nearly impossible logistically and would also spur social disruption by uprooting millions of farmers. For now, at least, the idea is to cluster adjoining fields into farms about the size of a Walmart Supercenter parking lot.Spend a few days with Jiang and Ping, and it can be hard to fathom that China also has some of the most sophisticated industrial farms in the world. The epitome of that is in the meat and dairy industries, which officials have modeled after those in the West. To see for myself, I had to go to eastern China, where I visited a four-year-old dairy bigger than most in the United States.Walking the length of a cow barn and processing plant at Modern Farming’s Bengbu Farm in Anhui Province, the largest dairy farm in China, took me almost five minutes. It was dim and cool, and there was a sweet smell, half animal and half decay, that wasn’t quite unpleasant. The cows, black-and-white mottled Holsteins, were quiet. They poked their heads through slotted metal fencing to reach feed along the concrete walkway and eyed me, a white-clad interloper in sterile coveralls, galoshes, bonnet, and face mask, with mild interest. The farm, nearly 600 acres, has eight enormous barns built to hold 2,880 milking cows each. Other barns and sheds hold calves and pregnant cows, putting the farm’s maximum bovine population at 40,000, among the largest in the world. Part of industrial agriculture’s allure is the sheer scale of it, and China has succumbed to this as it has expanded its meat and dairy production. China has always prized pork in its diet, and hogs were traditionally raised—and slaughtered—in backyard plots; as recently as 2001, farms with more than 50 hogs made up just a quarter of the market. By 2015 an estimated three-fourths of China’s hogs were being produced on such farms. An expanding appetite for poultry and eggs also has been answered by industrial farms. But perhaps the most surprising industrialization has been at dairy farms like the one I visited in Bengbu. Traditional production had been household based, as hogs were, but after a 2008 food-safety scandal involving fatally contaminated infant formula, China pushed the industry to modernize. In 2008 nearly one in six dairy farms held 200 or more cows. By 2013 more than one in three did.It’s difficult to overstate the importance of food safety to Chinese consumers. Besides fatal levels of melamine in baby formula, scandals have included long beans treated with a banned pesticide and adulterated fox meat passed off as donkey. A 2016 McKinsey & Company study found that nearly three-quarters of Chinese customers worry that the food they eat is harmful to their health. The vast number of small farms makes China’s food system “almost completely unmanageable in terms of food safety,” says Scott Rozelle, an expert on rural China at Stanford University. Industrial dairies and slaughterhouses make traceability and accountability for quality possible, and this is something Chinese consumers want. Indeed a colloquial phrase traditionally used to describe being at ease, “Put your heart down,” has been repurposed. Farmers repeatedly assured me that I could put my heart down with their food; it was, in other words, safe to enjoy.At Modern Farming’s dairy, officials introduced me to an employee, Zhang Yunjun, whose family home had been where the offices now stand. The Bengbu farm displaced about a hundred villagers, and the government moved them a little way down the road. People in the village cooperated willingly when officials promised jobs at the dairy, new housing, and regular increases to the rental fee for their land. Before the dairy Zhang had worked about six acres with two relatives, growing peanuts and wheat. Now 55, he tends to bedding in the barns and earns more than twice what he did farming. “People are very happy,” he says. “It was really hard working as a farmer. Now I can make much more.”Nearly every proponent of large-scale farms told me some version of this story, saying that big farms are effective solutions to poverty in rural areas. Farmers, the thinking goes, can work for the big farm and rent out their land, earning two incomes at once. But the reality doesn’t always match the sales pitch. “They do employ people, but it’s very limited,” says Ye Jingzhong, a rural sociologist at China Agricultural University in Beijing. “If they want to make a profit, the first thing they want to cut is the labor employment. And they can only employ a very limited amount of low-paid farmworkers.”As the sun began to set, I visited the displaced villagers and found their enthusiasm for the dairy much thinner than Zhang’s. They live in a gridded cluster of flat-roofed, two-story apartment buildings painted yellow, surrounded on three sides by peanut and corn fields. Across the road, the dairy’s alfalfa fields roll into the distance. A woman hanging laundry in her small concrete yard told me the water now smelled funny. Several people told me the dairy didn’t hire many workers, their homes were crumbling, and rental income had not budged in four years. Everyone complained about an inescapable stench from manure sprayed on the fields. Nobody I talked with seemed happy about having moved, but hardly anyone seemed all that upset either. The overriding sentiment was simply resignation.For most rural Chinese these agricultural projects are at best double-edged swords, just as they are elsewhere in the world. Big animal farms can offer some Chinese an escape from the grinding toil of peasant life, but they also bring significant environmental and health risks. A 2010 census of pollution by the Chinese government found agriculture to be the largest polluter of water, greater even than manufacturing. And with all of China’s pollution challenges, it’s hard to see how large-scale animal production will escape the pollution and public health problems attributed to, say, dairies in California—which are smaller than the mega-farms in China.The government says it recognizes the dangers and emphasizes addressing animal waste in a sustainable way. These concerns are shared by many of the agribusinesses in China, including Modern Farming. In Bengbu the company installed a biogas digester to turn manure into enough energy to meet one-third of its needs there and uses the by-products to fertilize its fields. “Almost no waste,” says Liu Qiang, the mild-mannered, bespectacled guide who took me around the farm. The whole thing, from the fields to the barns, the milking parlors to the bottling plant, he says, is “a demonstration for this country.”Across Hangzhou Bay from Shanghai, at the edge of a shimmering expanse of mudflats, a Thai animal-feed conglomerate is building a mega-farm with a sustainable bent. In exchange for a break on the rent and a 20-year contract, Charoen Pokphand, or CP Group, is converting 6,425 acres of filled-in mudflats outside the city of Cixi to food production. The goal is “to create value for society in all directions,” says Wang Qingjun, a senior vice president dressed in loose slacks and shirtsleeves.This is what China’s agricultural future looks like too: a transnational corporation sinking billions of yuan into an agrifood complex comprising fields, farms, factories, corporate offices, and even, eventually, employee housing ranging from apartments to waterfront villas. Last summer, rice paddies covered 3,600 acres. Of those, 115 acres were grown organically and stocked with crabs that are sold for food. There are produce greenhouses, broccoli fields, drones to distribute chemicals, a near-finished dumpling factory, and a one-million-hen egg factory slated to triple in size—large enough to justify a temperature-sensitive robot to automatically cull dead birds. CP Group also expects to harvest enough chicken manure annually to produce 22,000 tons of organic fertilizer.Last year the company built a vertical farm, an airy, translucent box housing six 30-foot towers with rotating shelves of plant beds, akin to Ferris wheels. When I visited, they held bok choy, amaranth, and garlic chives. The controlled environment allows for targeted fertilizer application, eliminates the need for most pesticides, and produces quadruple the yield of a field with the same footprint, Wang says. This is remarkably promising for a country with too little farmland, particularly one where farmers add to the country’s pollution woes by using three times as much fertilizer as needed. It also sets up CP Group to comply with the government’s goal, announced in 2015, of capping fertilizer and pesticide use by 2020.The complex is largely an exercise in applying manufacturing logic to food, and Wang, who struck me as part pragmatist, part dreamer, envisions it as a paragon of vertical integration. “The relationship of human and land should be in harmony,” he says. He sees the food-manufacturing system that CP Group is building as a way to accomplish that. For eggs that means growing grain for poultry feed, breeding chickens, then slaughtering and processing them once they are spent. Dumpling dough will be made from CP Group wheat and filled with the company’s meat and produce. To sell its products, the company has its own grocery stores. It’s an impressive vision, if nothing goes awry. But if, say, listeria were to end up in its fruits, contamination could spread far more widely and rapidly than in a decentralized system—as Americans have learned.Nearly all the large-scale farms in China are run by the government, cooperatives, and businesses, but I also met Liu Lin, a farmer in Inner Mongolia who has become well-off by growing alfalfa for industrial dairies. As a teenager Liu heard a radio broadcast about American farming and its use of machines to till the land. This sounded better than breaking up soil by hand with a hoe, and he became obsessed. Over time Liu persuaded local governments to rent him about 2,470 acres. He bought sophisticated agricultural machines from the U.S. and Europe that, in four hours, could finish what had taken 30 workers 20 days to do.By the time I met Liu last summer, his farm had several giant barns, barracks for workers, a set of offices and carports, and a two-story villa overlooking a pond. I watched, impressed, as a French silage baler rumbled across a field. In 89 seconds it vacuumed up mowed alfalfa, compressed it into a 1,700-pound cylinder, encircled it in plastic, and discharged it onto the field.Later Liu took his car, a Lexus SUV, to town to get it washed; his daughter-in-law drove me to meet him in her husband’s Lexus sedan, playing Amy Winehouse on the stereo. In the din of the car wash, I asked how much he earns: More than 10,000 yuan—$1,505—a month? I couldn’t hear his response, but I saw him smile. Later my interpreter told me he had emphatically said, yes, he made more than that—a lot more.I thought of Liu during my visit to CP Group’s park and corporate offices, where it’s easy to intuit another less discussed selling point of giant farms: money. Experts may debate what size farm will produce the most food per acre, but industrial farms still generate profit far more readily than small ones. CP Group is working to ensure that; the group has hired leading American business academics, as well as consultants such as McKinsey & Company, to help it succeed.When I visited the Cixi park in August, it was sweltering and humid, and Wang whisked me into a highly air-conditioned boardroom for a PowerPoint presentation. We moved on to lunch in an executive dining room with a wall of windows overlooking the grounds, about a dozen of us seated at a heavy wooden table with a rotating center. I was given the seat of honor, at Wang’s right, and we grazed on the 27 dishes arrayed on the lazy Susan, including grapes and dragon fruit from the park’s greenhouses. Wang offered me red wine and, in keeping with Chinese custom, praised me warmly. It was the most lavish meal I ate in China.Even as China strives to scale up its agriculture, many affluent urbanites have leapfrogged ahead to a distrust of industrial farming. A compelling example of this can be found north of Beijing, where Jiang Zhengchao, the son of Jiang and Ping, is helping build the latest addition to China’s agricultural future. Behind two squat concrete buildings next to a roaring freeway, he tends five acres that make up his patch of China’s agricultural quilt.Jiang grows nearly a hundred crops—watermelon, eggplant, taro, and sweet corn among them. He takes some to wholesale markets, but his primary business is persuading middle-class Beijingers to pay him in six-month installments for weekly delivery of safe, farm-fresh food to their door. He also rents plots to people who want to grow food, and for an extra fee, he will tend them. After beginning his business without pesticides and fertilizers, he now uses them sparingly; customers balked at pitted vegetables and undersized fruit. “I have this emotional bond” with farming, says Jiang, who has a degree in social work. He worked three years in an office, which he hated. Eventually he returned to farming—much to the dismay of his parents, who equate the fields with drudgery. “I cannot afford a luxury life,” he says, and he’s OK with that.Jiang is part of a phenomenon of rural-born, college-educated Chinese going back to the fields. Though small in scale, it is still common enough that there’s a phrase for its participants, fanxiang qingnian—young people returning to the countryside. They now have an organization dedicated to supporting their interests, Wotu Sustainable Agriculture Development Center, and a magazine catering to them called Sustainable Farming. China’s organic sector has boomed, with sales growing as much as 30-fold since 2006, according to a recent industry analysis. Researchers say that at least 122 community-supported agriculture (CSA) projects, with farmers following the same model as Jiang, have sprung up, but the movement claims there are hundreds. Nationwide a few Western-style farmers markets are operating, all in large cities.For consumers the appeal of small farms is twofold. It’s partly about trusting the farm to supply safe food. But smaller farms also reflect China’s agricultural traditions, says Wen Tiejun, a leading scholar of rural China, and that appeals to rural and urban Chinese alike. “In Asia you have 40 centuries of agriculture,” Wen says. “You not only get enough food for this big population but have a very good environment.” People know and remember this, he says. In 2008 Wen helped found Little Donkey, a model organic farm in Beijing. The next year it became a CSA after one of his graduate students returned from Minnesota, where she’d studied with food activists.This kind of food remains a minuscule share of China’s market. But it suggests that many Chinese aren’t completely sold on a future of industrial meals. Jiang Zhengchao understands why his parents would love to leave their farm behind, and he has no wish to repeat their hardships. But he’s also skeptical that industrialized farms are necessary.When I visited him, Jiang took me and some colleagues to dinner at a barbecue restaurant. We sat outside at a plastic table, watching a plump woman in a tight apron tend a narrow metal grill atop sawhorse legs. An industrial fan roared above it, spinning tendrils of smoke into the evening air. The woman brought us caramelized nuggets of pork and skewered chicken hearts, fibrous enoki mushrooms doused with sauce and black sesame, grilled garlic cloves, eggplant slick with oil and vinegar, boiled peanuts tossed with soy sauce. It was more meat than Jiang had eaten as a child but far less than is typical for Americans. As the light faded into dusk, elderly farmers loitered on a corner, selling off surplus scallions. Jiang told me he liked his life and later quoted poetry to illustrate what Americans tend to call living simply: an old but comfortable house, nothing too fancy, a beautiful space in the woods. “I don’t think it’s a bad thing in the old days that the people could support themselves from their own land,” he says. “In China if you are a farmer, then people look down on you, but I just love it. Life is short, so I do what I like.”Jiang has seen the benefits of the changes that China’s farms have undergone in the past four decades. Our meal with ample pork and chicken was part of that for him. So was the way his life encompassed a kind of time travel, looping between rural Gansu Province and hypermodern Beijing. But he wasn’t sure he’d stick it out with the CSA; it paid so little and took so much work. Maybe, he told me, he’d go back to Gansu and try to start a big farm.",

"We tend to think of Chinese cities in the context of expansion, but the reality is much more complex. It is true that in the last few decades Chinese cities have drawn millions of domestic migrants, emptying out rural villages. But another consequence of China’s economic miracle is often overlooked—its shrinking cities.Students waiting to take an art exam stand in front of posters promoting Fushun, Liaoning province.In 2016, Beijing City Lab, an academic network studying urban development in China, reported that more than a quarter of Chinese cities lost inhabitants from 2000 to 2010.“Underrepresented, understudied, and underreported,” Ying Long, associate professor of Tsinghua University’s School of Architecture in China who led the study, says of the cities with declining populations.Intrigued by the phenomenon, photographer Ronghui Chen began visiting the northeastern region in late 2016. His first destination was Yichun, in Heilongjiang, China’s northernmost province. The winter there is brutal, with temperatures frequently plummeting to -30F. Chen found young people in gyms and internet cafés, and on video-streaming apps, a popular way for Northeasterners to beat boredom and earn cash. Many wrestle with leaving for the promise of the big city, often lamenting that their small cities have little to offer them. Family and other responsibilities are a key reason some stay behind as their peers move to bigger, thriving, more energetic cities.Yichun was founded in 1958 as a lumber outpost surrounded by dense boreal forests. Since then, it has grown to a city with more than one million inhabitants. Timber from Yichun made up 10 percent of all timber used in construction in China, according to ChinaDaily. Su Yan, a 27-year-old civil servant from Yichun, refers to the city’s abundant forestry resources as “gold sands dripping from the sky.”“If you can’t catch everything with your hands, the sands will slip through your fingers,” he says. “No matter what, you’ll be rich.”Xiao Yue, 21, is a saleswoman at a fitness center in Shuangyashan, Heilongjiang province. She says that during the Northeast’s frigid winter people prefer to stay indoors. As going to the gym becomes more popular, she hopes to sell more fitness packages.Elderly locals visit the abandoned Red Bank Park in Fularji for leisure; young people are a rare sight.A hotel on the border of North Korea comes with telescopes to observe life to the south in Longjing.Like many people who worked for the local government, Yan’s parents were once considered socialist elites, enjoying job security and cradle-to-grave benefits. He remembers that bygone era fondly. “Oil, rice, meat, eggs, vegetables…” Yan lists items his parent received from work when he was a child. These handouts arrived often and in large quantities, enough for his family to live on for months. “If you don’t go out and buy yourself some new clothes, there’s no way you can spend your salary.”But over-logging quickly exhausted the very resource Yichun was built to exploit, and an economic downturn ensued in the 1990s. The city began to limit commercial logging, and in 2013, banned it entirely. “People really didn’t care about the ban in the beginning,” Yan says. “At first, loggers received oral warnings, then came the fines, jail time, and prison terms. Slowly and slowly, no one logged.”Learn how illegal logging is becoming more dangerous for criminals.The lack of jobs forced the able-bodied out to larger, more prosperous cities. Between 2000 and 2010, Yichun’s population declined eight percent, according to China’s National Population Census.Five Korean children pray in a local church in Longjing, Jilin province, China in 2017. Bordering North Korea, Longjing is home to a large ethnic Korean community.Many cities Chen photographed in the northeast share a similar fate. The population of Heilongjiang’s Fularji, known as the heart of China’s heavy industries, dwindled 10.3 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to government population census. For Longji, in Jilin, whose ethnic Korean residents have migrated to South Korea for jobs, that number was 18 percent. In Fushun, located in Liaoning, a factory town at the center of a revitalization effort, the loss was smaller, only three percent, according to data compiled by Beijing City Lab.Compared with cities in the American Rust Belt, the shrinkage rates of Chinese cities may seem insignificant. Detroit, for example, lost 25 percent of its population between 2000 and 2010. But the large quantity of China’s shrinking cities—and the fact that local officials are still planning based on false predictions of population expansion—made them unique, says Ying Long, the lead researcher of Beijing City Lab.Read about the five factors influencing the future of cities.After identifying 180 shrinking cities, Beijing City Lab found and studied the master plan documents of 63 cities, and all of them predicated population growth. “Only if there is population growth, can the government [acquire] and develop more land and get big projects,” he says.In a system where local officials’ performances are overwhelmingly judged based on the economic well-being of their jurisdiction, the idea of shrinking cities is almost a political taboo.A ferry on the Bai River in Fularji was remodeled into a restaurant after it was no longer in use, but the restaurant soon went out of business.A mirror leans against a wall covered with Korean carpets in Longjing, 2017.The Haun twins, 22, sell clothing in Fularji, but at times they did not make any money. "We plan to move to Zhejiang province,” they said.“Many people in China hold a deep-rooted idea of urbanization, which is that cities need to expand, populations need to grow,” Long says, adding that for many, “a contracting city can only mean decay.”Long hopes that planners can shift the focus to the people who continue to live in cities as they become smaller. “The most important thing in city planning should come down to fulfilling the quality of lives of people who remained,” he says.Su Yan doesn’t see how his city’s fate can be overturned since so many young people have left. He estimates that 60 percent of his high school class has moved to work in bigger, more prosperous cities—a choice he had made too when he graduated from college in Harbin, Heilongjiang’s capital. Until his business failed and his father, still in Yichun, became ill.See the young people in Japan who choose a life of isolation.Once Yan went home, his parents secured a job for him with a guaranteed income at a government-owned sports hall. Life became comfortable—and predictable. “My job now is to sit, or sometimes lie down, in the entrance office of the gym. When someone comes in, I check his membership card,” Yan says.Yan struggles to find friends and misses the excitement big cities offer. A fan of American singer Bob Dylan and the fast-food restaurant Burger King, which he frequented while living in the capital Harbin, Yan often complains about Yichun. “Not even the least-known musicians want to have a concert here. And if you want to have a different lifestyle, you have to achieve that through the internet or something,” he says. “But now my parents are old and my girlfriend is here too. To leave takes more than courage.”",
"Visitors walk through a "pop-up forest" that stood for three weeks in New York's Times Square. Cities are working to reintroduce nature into the urban environment, sometimes in unexpected ways.When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed its climate change hub from public view earlier this year, 17 cities had a response: Each posted the information on city government sites.The move was symbolic of a quiet revolution: Environmental, social, and economic change is increasingly centered at the city level.Innovation in cities was on display at a recent Greenbuild, an event devoted to green building and sustainable development that draws a diverse roster of attendees, from architects and engineers to school and hospital administrators.Some solutions were novel: A unit in the Boston mayor’s office called New Urban Mechanics that specializes in using low-cost hacks and technology to improve urban living highlighted city hall’s Stairs of Fabulousness. Created with simple rainbow-hued tape, the design—purported by its author to make the Brutalist building 400 percent more fabulous—was the result of a public space invitational to temporarily transform spots around the city. Other projects go deeper, but the stairs exemplify the group’s mission to delight and engage citizens—and a larger effort to refocus urban design around people. Here's how that trend and four others are defining the cities of the future.Cars no longer drive urban planning—today it’s “people-oriented design,” says Neil Angus, a Boston environmental planner who specializes in implementing the LEED neighborhood-focused sustainability standard. “That still accommodates cars, but people come first.”“It’s design on a pedestrian scale, with narrower streets, and pushing buildings closer to the street and to each other,” says Angus. “That in turn brings people closer together—the front porch concept.” Other aspects include a grocery store within walking distance, proximity to transit, high-performing green buildings, green space and trees along streets, and space for cyclists.In Boston’s diverse Dorchester neighborhood, the 13-block Talbot-Norfolk Triangle (TNT) is piloting that model of transformation in a historically underserved area. “We flipped the script,” says David Queeley of the area’s redevelopment corporation. “Why can’t this happen in low-income neighborhoods?”Spurred in part by the arrival of a commuter rail line along one of its borders, the community is converting vacant buildings and aging housing while building on economic opportunities that transit connectivity and revitalization bring—without displacing longtime residents. At least 100 affordable housing units have been built.“Boston has the largest income disparity of any city and it’s the fastest gentrifying,” says Queeley. “If we don’t do something differently, it’s going to look homogenous.”Inclusivity and innovation define renewal efforts. “We layer different sustainability strategies,” says Queeley. The Men of Color Initiative tackles TNT’s unemployment rate for men, which approaches 50 percent. Energy efficiency was improved by retrofitting more than 500 homes. For a safer pedestrian zone, TNT is part of Boston’s Slow Streets initiative, which enforces a neighborhood speed limit of 20 miles per hour. Residents and activists have helped create a sense of place with a park that’s become a hub for activity, mural projects, and an urban agriculture site. Bus shelters were outfitted with green roofs, a greenway trail system is under way, and a tree-planting program has also led to jobs through horticulture training.With 90 percent of our time spent indoors, building design and its impact in the workplace, schools, and even hospital settings has been an emerging area of research.Studies conducted by Harvard’s Healthy Buildings center found that in green buildings with enhanced ventilation and optimal thermal conditions, participants scored 26 percent higher on cognitive function tests and had fewer symptoms of sick building syndrome. Exposure to daylight and brighter, blue-enriched lighting, which best mimics natural light, was also associated with better sleep quality.Chemicals used in building materials and furnishings that are known to accumulate in both humans and the environment are coming under closer scrutiny by researchers, and Harvard is practicing what it teaches: The university’s purchasing community is working to reduce “chemicals of concern” throughout the campus, starting with buying furniture that’s free of flame retardants.Facebook and Kaiser Permanente have made similar pledges, and at Google—where cofounder Larry Page has been known to carry a particulate counter to monitor pollutants—a team is steering its global offices and vendors toward safer options, potentially extending the company’s influence with a database that scores products for health impacts and transparency. Perkins+Will architects urges designers to follow recommendations in a “precautionary list,” which includes substances such as antimicrobial agents.Test your knowledge of how buildings impact health.Urban planners continually find more creative ways to weave nature into the city, particularly with space at a premium. It doesn’t necessarily have to take the form of sprawling parks. Jonce Walker, who works in sustainable design in New York City, sees pockets of nature functioning like “acupuncture” for residents. “Small, strategic interventions offer relief to people who live in cities,” says Walker. “We must be careful not to erase nature out of cities, and work on putting nature back in.”The best of these spots, he says, have the element of surprise—encountering nature where one might least expect it—and offer “dwell time,” a way to linger and admire it.Walker points to projects such as Paley Park and PARK(ing) Day, a movement to convert metered parking spots into temporary public spaces that began in San Francisco and spread to other cities. In New York, it’s similarly represented by Street Seats, a seasonal program allowing benches and chairs, surrounded by landscaping, to be installed on streets. “It’s taking back part of the street for cars and giving it to people,” says Walker. In Brooklyn, the 2,000 Gallon Project uses dumpsters planted with trees and vegetation to divert stormwater that might ordinarily overflow with sewage into Gowanus Canal. The display “integrates nature into a very industrial place—and it’s moveable,” he says.Planting trees is a more permanent solution. Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities have committed to a 40 percent canopy cover goal. D.C. is already close—about 38.7 percent—and it’s moved to protect “heritage trees” whose trunks are 100 inches or more in circumference, says Luke Cole of the city’s environment and energy department. About 12,000 trees were planted over the last year as part of the effort. Citizens are in on it too: A program offers a consult for residential property owners and subsidies for incorporating shade trees, rain gardens, and native plants, which help reduce storm runoff. The program contributes up to 8 percent of the city’s new trees.(See innovative green space in Singapore, the leading biophilic city.)Superstorm Sandy’s crippling effect on Manhattan in 2012 propelled cities to launch resilience plans that anticipate rising seas, more frequent storms, and flooding. In 2014 San Francisco became the first to designate a climate resilience officer, and at least 84 other global cities have followed. In the wake of recent hurricanes impacting Houston, Miami, and Puerto Rico—the most expensive hurricane season in U.S. history—efforts have accelerated.At the confluence of two rivers, Washington, D.C., is battling both sinking and sea-level rise—levels have risen 11 inches over the past century, with 40 inches projected by 2080.Climate Ready DC outlines measures for coping with those, along with more intense rainfall and storm surge, and highlights neighborhoods at risk. The plan’s 77 actions range from increasing the number of green roofs (already incentivized), collecting stormwater, creating micro-grids for energy and water, incorporating resilience in building and zoning codes, and identifying “cooling centers” where those who may not have access to air conditioning could retreat during scorching summer heat—the city projects two to three times as many dangerously hot days.The plan also calls for “a communications exercise,” a strategy for reaching different segments of the city, says Perkins+Will architect Jon Penndorf, who was part of a team that developed the plan. That includes outreach to lower income and less mobile populations, who are often in the most vulnerable parts of the city, by enlisting existing channels, such as churches and other community groups, and messaging for tourists too, he says.Net-zero waste, water, and energy have been called the sustainable trifecta, creating “living buildings.” Seattle’s Bullitt Center, for example, has a rooftop rainwater harvesting system and composting toilets and taps solar energy for its needs.As of 2016, about 200 commercial buildings in the U.S. claimed the net-zero energy standard, which means the building generates all its own power through on-site renewable sources. Schools and campuses are increasingly incorporating net-zero energy systems—and using them as a teaching tool. (See a gallery of innovative educational facilities.)In Oregon, where buildings consume 30 percent of the state’s energy use, it may soon be the norm. By October 2023, all new homes must be “zero-energy ready”—equipped for solar panel installation. Residents of the 50 U.S. states and Germany can now see the solar potential of their own homes by street address in Google’s Project Sunroof.Zero waste is somewhat of a misnomer: It means that 90 percent has been diverted from landfills, by prevention, reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting. Facilities, universities, and dozens of cities are getting in on the effort too, committing to reaching zero waste within the next two decades. Ljubljana, Slovenia, is leading the way in Europe while in the U.S. San Francisco may be the first to reach the target, aiming for 2020, through its “fantastic three”—separate composting, recycling, and trash bins for residents.

"It was while watching the movie The Savages in 2009 that photographer Kendrick Brinson caught her first glimpse of Sun City, Arizona, a sprawling retirement community northwest of Phoenix. The film scene—with bright desert light, cacti, golf carts, and tidy rows of ranch-style homes—“had this really strange, very visually interesting look to it,” she says.Since then, Brinson, 40, has gone every year to photograph Sun City’s residents, some of whom have become her close friends. Observing the enthusiasm people have for the many activities there, the self-described perfectionist says she learned something about herself: “I realized that I don’t have to be great, or even good, at something. I can just like the way it feels.” She’s taken up hobbies such as watercolor painting.Opened in 1960, Sun City bills itself as the Original Fun City, designed for residents 55 and older. While retirement communities have proliferated across the country to cater to growing numbers of graying baby boomers, Sun City remains one of the largest. Its 14 square miles of palm tree–lined streets feature eight golf courses, eight recreation centers with seven aquatic facilities, multiple strip malls, two libraries, a hospital, and one cemetery.The average age of the nearly 40,000 residents is 73. Sun City has been overwhelmingly white, but Brinson says the community is starting to focus more on diversity and inclusiveness and now has an LGBT club. On each visit, she finds herself reenergized. “It’s this purposeful learning, socializing, playfulness that I find super fascinating,” she says.As with any group of aging people, loss is very much a part of life at Sun City; some of Brinson’s friends have passed away. But residents say they don’t dwell on death. “This is not God’s waiting room,” one told her. “Everyone is active and doing something.”",
"Members of the Sun City Poms, a cheerleading squad, have been hula hooping together outside since the COVID-19 pandemic stopped their regular practices. The Poms are one of many clubs and teams in Sun City, a community fostering active retirement.Peggy Parsons had a dream. In her eighth decade she wanted to be a cheerleader. So she convinced her husband Bill to pack up their house and move 15 minutes down the road to Sun City, Arizona, a community with palm trees and cactus-lined streets where 40,000-some residents—who average 73.5 years of age—can join more than 130 clubs, from mahjong and pickleball to tapdancing and cheerleading.It was not the first (or farthest) move for Parsons, now 79. But it was a momentous one. She and Bill, now 92, are residents of what was the first community of its kind when it opened in 1960. Located in Maricopa County, less than 30 minutes northwest of Phoenix, Sun City is designed to foster active retirement, to provide people over 55 a full life after work and raising children.With its seven recreational centers and eight golf courses, Sun City is “like Disneyland for seniors,” Peggy said. “It’s like living permanently on vacation, but you don’t have to live out of your suitcase.”An aerial view of Sun City, Arizona, which was opened in 1960 to give people over 55 a home where they could still be active.A sign at St. Christopher’s Episcopal Church in Sun City urges residents to stay home. In March, the community’s churches and recreation centers shut down because of the pandemic.A crowd gathers at the Sun Bowl Amphitheater to watch Bella Donna, a Fleetwood Mac tribute band in October 2014.But in March, the bustle and energy that made Sun City so appealing to its residents lurched to a halt. The community’s residents are considered particularly susceptible to the virus due to their age. As of October 22, the county where they live, Arizona’s most populous, has had 65 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the state. Local news estimates that there are around 850 cases in the Sun City area.In this insular community, the pandemic poses problems large and small. Suddenly, people had “nothing to do and all day to do it,” says 72-year-old Bill Pearson, who has lived here for 17 years. All of the community’s recreation centers were closed, as were the amphitheater, softball field, bowling centers, and dog park. Golf, which Arizona governor Doug Ducey declared an essential service, was permitted to continue.The 3,000-capacity Sun Bowl Amphitheater has been empty since March. All shows have been cancelled and will not resume until 2021.The Sun City Poms practiced twice a week for three hours and performed 12 parades and 50 shows a season before the pandemic.Peggy Parsons, 79, is vice president of the Poms and moved to Sun City specifically to join the team. She’s written two novels during quarantine, one of which has already been published.Poms president Geri Braddock, 73, doesn’t believe the group will practice together again until next year. A nurse epidemiologist before she retired, she has been doing volunteer consulting work with the Los Angeles Public Health Department during the pandemic.The Sun City Poms, currently led by Braddock and Parsons, started in 1979 when the Sun City Saints, a women’s softball team, had trouble drawing a crowd. “No one came to watch, so they decided they needed cheerleaders. And it worked!” says Geri.For some, social distancing and shelter-in-place rules meant they were cut off from their social circles. Before the pandemic, Marilyn Richling, 76, and her husband John, 73, spent much of their time square dancing with friends. Their vulnerability due to preexisting medical conditions means that they no longer leave their home."[Square dancing] was my only outlet, other than church and family. Church shut down. Square dancing shut down,” Marilyn said. “It was stay at home and do nothing.”The Sun City Squares, a square and round dancing club with more than 60 members, met twice a week before the pandemic. They haven’t been able to dance together since March.Marilyn Richling, president of the Sun City Squares, and her husband, John, outside their home in Sun City. The couple actually met on a dance floor 35 years ago. “I just went through a divorce and I knew that at dance lessons there’s usually a shortage of men,” John remembers. “Then Marilyn showed up and asked if I needed a partner for the night.”Some residents have adapted. Every morning at 6 a.m., the pickleball players put up portable nets and chalk three courts onto the pavement of a church parking lot. The Desert Aires, a group of barbershop singers, learned to use Zoom so they could rehearse. Jeff Skaggs, 69, one half of a two-man band called Dos Boomers, invited neighbors to bring lawn chairs to the cul de sac in front of his home for a free outdoor concert.Players compete in a two-day lawn bowling tournament near a Sun City recreation center in December 2013.John Stewart, 84, stands outside his house in Sun City, where he has lived with his wife Dora, 80, for 23 years. Originally from Scotland, the couple has won national lawn bowling tournaments and are in the sport’s U.S. hall of fame. “I think we are the only couple” in the hall of fame, John says. “Alive,” Dora adds.The Sun City Aqua Suns, a synchronized swimming team, walk the red carpet at the Lakeview Recreation Center before a performance in December 2010.Sun City residents play water volleyball at one of the community’s seven recreation centers in 2017. Before the pandemic, the team played games three times a week.Tracy Schenck, 57, moved to Sun City from Denver in May 2019. “I was 55 and in Denver and I said, Lord, I don’t see myself 60 in this big city,” she says. “I need a place I can work and build relationships and die.” She is now Sun City’s events and entertainment coordinator as well as a member of the water volleyball team.Purple Woods, 78, was born dancing, she says. Before the pandemic she danced four nights a week at Sun City’s dancing clubs. “That's the reason I came down here,” she says. “In fact, in 2005 when I had cancer, I said, Lord, I don't mind if I go through all this chemotherapy but if I can't dance after, I don't want to live.”As vice president of the Sun City Poms cheerleading squad, as well as the treasurer of the Tip Top Dancers tap club, Parsons is missing the action. In a typical year, the Poms march in 12 parades and put on 50 shows a season. “A lot of [my time was] spent dancing,” she said. “Once you retire, it’s like how did I ever have time to work?”The Sun City Poms don’t think they can practice again until next year, says team president Geri Braddock. But that hasn’t stopped them from seeing each other. After Geri found two hula hoops in her garage, they realized they could all hula hoop outside together safely. They now meet once a week at 7 a.m. in a teammate’s backyard.“My whole insides were happy again. When we started this, I had this happy glow all day long,” said Kathy Villa, 63, who is also in the yoga club, the tai chi club, and the tap club. “We got to see friends and socialize and speak to people face to face. It was a wonderful day.”For many of the women, the Poms are more than just a team. Cheryl Jackson, 68, left behind four children, nine grandchildren, and a city she knew to move to Sun City nine years ago, and the cheerleaders have become her friends, sisters, and support system. “What’s wrong with joy?” she said. “It’s something we definitely need now.”Family and friends release balloons at the memorial service for Monte Haag, who moved to Sun City in 2000 and died in December 2010 in a plane crash.Loretta Chapman, 66, walks her dogs Buster and Bubby in her golf cart four times a day. She says the pandemic hasn’t impacted her life in a major way other than wearing a mask when grocery shopping.Many Sun City residents have tried to make the most of the quarantine. "I don't really feel like I've been suppressed at all," says Lynda Skaggs. "I love living here. I've made more friends in the last three years than the last 25."",
"After my father died, my mother joined a community center with a pool and started swimming laps several times a week. Dorothy was nearly 80. She met people, learned about local programs and services for older folks, and discovered a senior center that remains her hangout 18 years later. It serves hot lunch for a dollar. A dee jay comes in and she dances. She has made friends, including a group of women who meet for lunch every Saturday in a restaurant that serves huge portions and free coffee refills. I often say, only half-jokingly, she has a better social life than I do.Scientists have known for quite a while that people with strong ties to friends and family tend to live long. A team from Brigham Young University looked at results from 148 studies dating back to 1900 that investigated whether solid relationships are a lifesaver. All told, the studies included 308,849 participants and followed subjects for an average 7.5 years. At the end of that time, people with strong social connections were 50 percent more likely to be alive than those who were isolated and lonely.According to the analysis, a satisfying social life was as beneficial for long-term survival as quitting smoking (something my mother did after a four-decade habit) and may be even more crucial than exercise and overcoming obesity.Social connections may influence health through what the researchers call “stress buffering.” Support from others helps us adapt emotionally to illness, the death of a loved one, or other challenges that often pile up as we get older. Better coping, in turn, eases the flow of stress-induced hormones that weaken our immune system and increase susceptibility to deadly infections, heart disease, and stroke. Strong relationships also encourage us to take better care of ourselves, and can provide a sense of purpose—another factor associated with longer life.In research like this, of course, it’s difficult to tease out cause and effect. Does social engagement keep older people healthy—or does robust health give them the zest and desire to spend time with friends? Either way, an editors’ note accompanying the Brigham Young analysis said doctors and other health professionals “should take social relationships as seriously as other risk factors that affect mortality.”Becca Levy, a professor of epidemiology and psychology at Yale University, points to another influence on healthy longevity: our beliefs about aging. She has published scores of studies demonstrating that whether we think of old age as a time to enjoy or something to dread has a powerful influence on how well, or how badly, we do as we inch closer to that stage.Levy became curious about the health effects of aging beliefs—and how cultural stereotypes and values about the elderly shape our personal attitudes—as a graduate student visiting Japan. That country has one of the world’s highest life expectancies. For a long time, scientists chalked it up to genes and diet, but Levy wondered if something less obvious was at play.Her ideas about aging beliefs jelled when a national holiday, Keiro No Hi, which translates as Respect for the Aged Day, rolled around in September. Seniors packed parks and dined at restaurants for free. Schoolchildren delivered meals to shut-ins. In Japan, she observed, older people commanded respect, even reverence. They were not shunted aside or ridiculed as “geezers” or “over the hill.”“What I actually noticed was how differently the culture seemed to treat the oldest members of the Japanese society, as opposed to some more of the ageism that I was used to seeing in the United States,” Levy recalls.Levy has found that adults in their 30s and 40s who had positive notions about old age—they equated it with wisdom, for example, instead of decrepitude—were more likely to be in good health decades later. In another study, she showed that people 50 and older who had optimistic views of aging were much better able to perform everyday tasks over their next 18 years—activities like shoveling snow and walking a half-mile—than peers who regarded old age bleakly. Older people who had positive age beliefs at the start of one of Levy’s studies were also much more likely to fully regain function after a new disabling injury.Levy’s research also suggests that rose-colored perceptions of aging offer protection against cognitive decline, even in adults who are genetically susceptible. Levy and her colleagues studied people who carried the APOE ε4 gene, which increases the risk of Alzheimer’s. At the start of the project, all her subjects were dementia-free. Those who had upbeat views of old age were 47 percent less likely to develop dementia than the APOE ε4 carriers who had grim notions of aging.In another study, Levy found that relatively young, healthy, cognitively fit people who saw nothing promising about growing old were much more likely to eventually develop plaques and tangles in the brain, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. And their hippocampi, the curved brain structures essential for memory, shrank three times as fast.Perhaps most striking, Levy discovered that people with the brightest view of aging lived an average seven and a half years longer than those with the gloomiest.How do beliefs exert such power? For one thing, Levy says, people with a positive mindset about aging tend to have better self-efficacy and self-mastery, the ability to take control of their lives and regulate their impulses. They also tend to eat well, exercise, and take prescribed medications. And they have lower levels of the hormone cortisol and other biomarkers of stress.“What’s important about age beliefs is they’re malleable,” she says.Writing is one way to shift how we think about aging. In a study, Levy asked groups of adults to imagine a day in the life of a hypothetical older person who is physically and mentally healthy, and briefly write about it once a week. After just four weeks, negative perceptions of aging declined significantly.She also has had study subjects keep a journal of portrayals of elders on TV. It opened people’s eyes to the condescending and ugly stereotypes that bombard us and twist our perceptions and assumptions about aging. “The idea is to make people more aware of both their own age beliefs, and the age-belief messaging they encounter in everyday life,” Levy says.I asked Levy if our collective view of aging has improved as the elder population has ballooned and more of us hit and surpass 65. In fact, she told me, ageist biases have gotten worse.She and her colleagues developed a computerized linguistic program and analyzed a database of more than 400 million words from books, newspapers, magazines, and academic journals going back 200 years. The team looked at adjectives that appeared most frequently with “elderly” and similar words, and at synonyms for “old people.” The language was generally positive until the late 1800s, when life expectancy for white people in America was 41 years. (Researchers at that time did not track life expectancy for other populations.) Since then, old-age-related verbiage has steadily become meaner and more dismissive. For example, the word geezer, which first appeared in 1900, became 11 times more frequent through the twentieth century.Old people may be the last group our society feels free to mock, Levy says. She points to news reports about cruel jokes early in the COVID pandemic, when people over age 65 were dying at exceptionally high rates and the term “boomer remover” became a widely shared meme on Twitter.Reading research by scientists trying to unravel the mysteries of aging can make it hard to feel good about growing older. The idea of “curing” aging casts it as pathology. Published studies start, relentlessly, with bad news. “Aging is a degenerative process that leads to tissue dysfunction and death,” begins a typical paper.“I think by labeling aging as a disease, it ignores the many strengths of aging and the many ways that there can be growth in later life,” Levy says.The more I learned about the science of longevity, the more excited I felt about the prospects for discoveries that will benefit all of us as we grow older. But as I approached 68, I couldn’t shake off nagging images of the tissue dysfunction and cell death occurring inside me.Steve Horvath, developer of epigenetic clocks to measure biological age, offered to run one on me—a test with the anxiety-producing name of GrimAge. I sent him two tiny vials of my blood. A few months later I received the results: My biological age was 3.3 years lower than my chronological age.The report offered a cheerful “congrats” and said, “You are already beating the clock!” Still, I felt let down. I certainly wasn’t in league with some of the longevity scientists I met, like David Sinclair, who exercise religiously, fast, take supplements or off-label drugs, and seem to buck the tempest of time.Then I thought about my mother, still enjoying life in her late 90s. Becca Levy’s research convinced me that my mom’s outlook at least partly explains her vitality. I’ve never heard her grumble about her birthday or say she can’t do something because she’s too old, a complaint I’m starting to hear from friends my age.“No,” she says, when I point this out. “I’m not too old. I might do it slower, and I might do less of it. But I’m not too old to dance or walk or do anything I like to do.”She pauses. “Well, I wouldn’t swim anymore.”“Because you haven’t done it in a long time?”“Because I don’t like the way I look in a bathing suit.”",
"A toddler’s curiosity can be infectious. Walking to a park in their London neighborhood a few years ago, Eduard Florin Niga and his young daughter met an ant on the pavement. The girl stopped to examine it. “Where are the ant’s eyes, Dad?” she asked. Her father, a teacher—and a former police officer in his native Romania, where he documented crime scenes—knew photography would provide the answer.Ants are one of Earth’s most abundant and successful animals. Fossils indicate they arose between 168 million and 140 million years ago. Today more than 15,000 species may exist. Some 12,000 of them have been described, and dozens have portraits in Niga’s debut book, Ants: Workers of the World.Niga’s mode of macrophotography is painstaking, whether he’s magnifying a thing to 10 times its size or a thousand. He works alone at night in the back of his house, where vibrations from passing vehicles won’t disturb his setup. The room’s only illumination is the light he trains on his subjects. (Read about a photographer’s painstaking steps to get just the right image of fire ants.)Collaborators send Niga specimens of ants and other insects, or he orders them online. Some arrive alive; they’re returned to the sender after the photo shoot or live out their days in colonies Niga keeps. Other specimens arrive preserved, often in ethanol. To ready a dead specimen for its close-up, Niga carefully rehydrates it, cleans it, pries open its jaws, and pins it in a lifelike position. (“It’s a little world,” he says, “so every little thing matters.”) He then takes hundreds of magnified images of the insect’s parts. To make the final portrait, Niga combines 150 to 500 of the images using a process called focus stacking, in which similar images with different focal points are blended to achieve a more profound depth of field. Completing one of these portraits can require a week or longer.Combining images doesn’t work with live models—movement can make an ant look, for example, as if it has several heads—so capturing a satisfactory photo of a live insect can take Niga a couple of days. He says he isn’t a patient person in most situations, “but with this, I don’t know where the patience comes from. It’s probably because I absolutely love it.” Niga hopes his images foster a greater appreciation of the world’s tiny creatures—eyes and all.",
"I spent early 2020 in a UC Riverside lab filming hummingbirds, trying to come up with new techniques for capturing their movements and behavior. The pandemic ended that; in mid-March we had to leave the university, and the whole state locked down.Normally I live with four other housemates; that grew to eight. It was sort of an impromptu commune and a wonderful time. We all really bonded, and I got to reconnect with folks I hadn’t spent much time with when I was on the road eight or nine months a year.I have a fellowship from National Geographic and the Rita Allen Foundation to study jellyfish. Initially it was to be a global project: flying to Japan, visiting aquariums, filming and photographing in the ocean. But even before COVID-19, I had been preparing to do more work at home, in a detached garage I use as a lab. I had set up a tank with guidance from Steve Spina of the New England Aquarium, and he FedExed me jellyfish. So in quarantine I focused on one species of moon jelly (photo, top), trying to coax all of their secrets out of them in front of the camera.(See more of 2020’s best photography, including discoveries, animals, travel, and moments we’ll never forget.)By midsummer, the tank was getting a little dirty, so I cleaned it—and the polyps in the tank, the early life stage, began to transform. I walked in one day and saw a little brown structure standing out against all these white polyps! This metamorphosis is the basis of my whole jellyfish project, showing how their bodies change shape in response to age and stress. Over time I learned to trigger the process: I pop a jar of polyps in the fridge for two weeks, and after that, they will transform into baby jellies. Now I can re-create experiments I’ve read about in research papers, describing how jellyfish are able to reverse their age back to polyps by reorganizing the tissue in their bodies. I don’t have a lot of confidence that I can pull this off, but that’s what I’m trying to capture in images.In quarantine, when I didn’t have the access to tools or the bandwidth to work on photography, I poured my energy into cooking and gardening. Our household went through at least 200 pounds of flour baking bread; it was a little out of control. And I’d start every day with a book and a cup of tea in the garden, where it’s like you blend into the landscape. I had birds landing on me, and a raccoon walked over my feet.This has always been the lesson of the garden: If you actually succeed in controlling it to the degree you want to in the beginning, the result is boring, ugly, and clearly contrived. It’s like that in photography.“Would you like a job? I need a photo of fire ants, clumping together to form a raft in a puddle of water.” Susan Welchman, a formidable and exacting photo editor, was offering a 2011 assignment to Anand Varma, who until then had only assisted veteran National Geographic photographers. With what they’d taught him, Varma felt ready to tackle the assignment. He told Welchman yes.When a fire ant colony gets flooded, the ants hook their feet to other ants’ bodies to create a buoyant mass, taking turns above and below the waterline. That’s the view Welchman wanted.At a Georgia Tech lab, Varma scooped ants into shallow water in a glass tank, watched the ants clump, and took scores of photos. Welchman rejected them as no better than amateur shots she’d seen. “I screwed it up,” Varma recalls thinking; he imagined waiting 10 years “for everybody there to forget who I was” before Geographic would hire him again.Go back, Welchman told Varma. Try again.His shots through the side of the tank flopped because water “forms this little lip, the meniscus, against the glass, and it creates this out-of-focus band,” Varma says now. How to fix it?A lab technician showed Varma a glass coating that would prevent the meniscus from forming. Now Varma’s photographs had “a very crisp edge” at the waterline. Welchman liked that but told him, “You need more ants.” He put in more ants.The assignment was for two days; Varma went back for a third. That’s when he captured the remarkable scene and earned high praise from Welchman: “This is what makes a photograph worthy of National Geographic.” —PE",
"My sons are 15 and 12. We don’t do it every day, but frequently we sit down and talk about events. We talked about George Floyd, because I was in Houston to photograph the funeral after George died May 25 with a policeman’s knee on his neck.I started out by saying to them that when I was allowed to go into the church and photograph George, I did not photograph him for 12 minutes. Like, people were behind me going, Dude, let’s go. You know, the line of people waiting.But for me it was important to tell George’s body thanks. Thanks for his life. Thanks for the opportunities that we’re all going to get because of his death. Thanks for what is going to shift the narrative, what’s going to be changed because of his death. And it was important to do that.(See more of 2020’s best photography, including discoveries, animals, travel, and moments we’ll never forget.)I wanted them to understand that moment—that you’re not going to get Angela Davis on the front of Vanity Fair, or Breonna Taylor does not go on the front of a magazine, just because. We’re getting all of this influx of interest in racial justice, and this attention is coming because of all these names, all these hashtags. And so it was important for me to let them understand what that death means for us.That it’s not just, he’s dead and gone, and here is another dead, hashtagged person. That his death is going to allow us new life, a new voice, a new push, and that our job is to be a part of this struggle and a part of this fight in a very positive way.My sons, they can’t go anywhere; they understand what that is. I do not allow them to ride around the block in Cleveland. They cannot go take their bikes and go outside without me or their mom watching them. That’s their reality.I keep telling my boys that they have to be about loving—loving who they are and loving their culture. My sons have the distinction of having a mom who is half Chinese. And so they do adopt parts of the Chinese culture. And I am Jamaican, so they do adopt a lot of the Jamaican culture. And they are Americans, so they live in an American culture.I’ve always tried to give them this very holistic way of being in the world. But as they’re doing that, they have to start loving and appreciating their culture and not believe that what’s outside of theirs is better than theirs. We have to get to the space where we truly love our culture enough to be able to live in it.Ruddy Roye’s first assignment for National Geographic was to photograph people who donated artifacts to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in Washington, D.C., in 2016. “For me it was a huge deal,” Roye says, “because I was photographing people who have lived with Nat Turner’s Bible, they have lived with their ancestor’s free paper, they have lived with the clothes and belongings of James Baldwin. And finally, these items were going to be put in a space where they could be shared.”Roye recalls the assignment as “really tough” because many artifacts came with painful stories, and the items’ faithful guardians were now aged and infirm.“I felt honored and humbled by them,” Roye says. “Meeting Elaine Thompson, a person who had preserved her ancestor’s free paper—and then knowing that she died a few months after I had photographed her. There’s nothing in my life that can rise to that moment.”For years, Roye says, he vowed “that I would never go to anybody else’s museum until I had one. So finally I get to embrace a history that I thought was lacking. It was beautiful to me.”Roye feels a duty to tell these stories as well as photographs can. He relates that to “a saying my mom always said: ‘If not you, who?’ So I embraced the responsibility with a lot of grace and gratitude.” —PG",
"This story appears in the January 2021 issue of National Geographic magazine. It is part of a series in which five contributors answer the question “What was it like to be a photographer in 2020?”Hear more from photographer Hannah Reyes Morales in our podcast, Overheard at National Geographic.Over the past few years I’ve been working on “Living Lullabies,” my project on how caregivers create safer spaces for their children through nighttime song and story.My reporting partner, Rupert Compston, and I went to the Turkish-Syrian border; for refugee and migrant families there, lullabies were a piece of home that they could take with them, almost as portable sanctuaries. We went to Liberia, where we spoke with young mothers who’d had their babies as teenagers, and saw how they were singing hope in their lullabies. Then we visited Mongolia, one of the coldest places in the world. To heat their homes, nomadic families would burn coal, which of course pollutes the air. We met a mother who sang lullabies with healing words when her children were sickened by the air.Those were the places we had gone to, and we had a plan for the rest of the story. But we had to shift to address this experience that we’re all going through, the pandemic. I got to see what making safe spaces looks like in real time, with parents helping their children navigate swiftly changing environments.(See more of 2020’s best photography, including discoveries, animals, travel, and moments we’ll never forget.)In the United States I visited families whose children had hearing loss. Lullabies aren’t just about the song; it’s about feeling your mom’s face close to you, feeling her gentle rocking. One mom whose son has a cochlear implant said she sings to him every night because she doesn’t know whether he’ll be able to hear her anymore the next day.We think of lullabies as songs just for children, but they’re also for the caregiver. In the context of the pandemic, we looked at how health-care and other essential workers were still using bedtime rituals and lullabies, but in ways that safely isolated them from their kids. One of the health-care workers told me it was very different from what she had always thought protection looked like. Before, it was about being physically present—but now to protect her children, she had to be physically separate, singing and telling stories to them only through mobile phone and video calls.It was such a revelation to me, seeing this pandemic play out on a global scale and then seeing it on the granular scale in different bed spaces. I’m proud that we were able to continue a project that was very, very close to my heart and not let the pandemic derail it.Hannah Reyes Morales feels strongly about how media depict “women who are survivors.” In part that’s because she is a survivor of childhood sexual assault. And she’s committed to using photography to document the realities of women survivors’ lives, which, she says, often are “much more complex than they’re made out to be.”In the project “Shelter from the Storm,” Morales partnered with writer Aurora Almendral to tell the stories of Filipinas who left rural provinces to become sex workers in Angeles City, a Philippine red-light district. Many of the women support families in villages that, as climate change worsens, may increasingly be devastated by typhoons.Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest tropical cyclones on record, hit the Philippines in 2013. It displaced some four million people, creating what one government official called a “feast for human traffickers” who drew desperate women to work in bars, where some became sex workers.Among those Morales photographed were three sisters who sent earnings home so their mother could afford cancer treatment and rebuild the home that Haiyan destroyed.Pursuing sensitive subjects has convinced Morales of this: “If you stay with the story long enough, you’ll see how people find ways to navigate difficult situations. So we shouldn’t come in saying, ‘This is their story.’ We should always be taking our cues from them.” —PE",
"This story appears in the December 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine. The nonprofit National Geographic Society helped fund this article.Hear more from photographer Hannah Reyes Morales in our podcast, Overheard at National Geographic.The song comes alive as night draws in. Hear it curl beneath the blanket, slip between the fold of cradling arms, in rooms across the world. To an audience of children, a hidden chorus of caregivers fills the night with song. They’re singing lullabies.For Khadija al Mohammad, nighttime has always been the time for silence, comfort, and quieting the noises of the day. When her eldest son, Muhammed, was born 19 years ago, a decade before the Syrian civil war, she sang sweet lullabies—songs passed down by her mother and grandmother, songs of heritage and place.As the conflict escalated, her family left their home in Kafr Nubl in 2013 and made a reluctant crossing to Turkey, where her youngest child, Ahmad, three, was born.Khadija’s lullabies have changed with her journey. A schoolteacher and mother of five, she is among 12 million displaced from Syria since 2011, the result of a conflict that has killed probably more than a half million people.Khadija, now a Turkish citizen, is like many mothers around the world, nurturing children and soothing them with lullabies in environments fraught with hazards. Sung in our most intimate spaces as our days come to a close, these songs hold far more than their function. As situations change, lullabies help to establish safe spaces for children. Today, amid sweeping changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, lullabies endure as an especially important way to preserve tender moments between parents and their young children. (Read about bedtime rituals during a pandemic.)Sung across cultures, lullabies echo the histories of those who sing them. Khadija’s lullabies became songs about the war. “My children knew about my feelings,” she muses. From their tent in a resettlement camp to their home in an apartment in Şanlıurfa, nightmares have followed Khadija. She dreams of helicopters and of the Syrian army following her, and she wakes up worrying about her children. They huddle around her when they see her in tears. By a mattress on the floor, she gently lays Ahmad down on her legs, rocks him slowly, and sings.“Ohh aircraft, fly in the sky and do not strike the children in the street. Be tender and kind to these children.”A Babylonian lullaby that’s about 4,000 years old was found inscribed on a clay tablet. By the glow of a phone or to the thrum of a city, lullabies still charm babies to sleep today. We inherit them, and we pass them on. We carry lullabies across borders and make new ones along the way. They contain the traces of those who came before us, and they will carry traces of us long after we’re gone. Within these songs we’ve expressed not just our greatest fears, but in the same breath, our hopes and prayers. They are likely to be the first love songs children hear.Like many lullabies around the world, Khadija’s song is a response to the pressures of the day. And although lullabies sound soothing and reassuring, their lyrics often are dark and far from comforting—they’re a window into our fears. The Icelandic lullaby “Bíum, Bíum, Bambaló” is haunted by a face at the window. The Russian “Bayu Bayushki Bayu” warns to stay away from the edge of the bed or a little gray wolf will drag a baby into the woods and under a willow bush.As lullabies hold our fears about a world that’s often unforgiving and cruel, these songs don’t always shield us from it. “Rock-a-Bye, Baby,” one of the most well-known English-language lullabies, is after all a song about a cradle falling from a treetop, baby and all.But lesser known are the lyrics of a modern, longer version. “Rock a bye baby / do not you fear / Never mind baby / Mother is near” begins the last stanza. Lullabies reveal our fears, but perhaps more importantly, they are a reflection of our reassurances. “Now sound asleep / until morning light,” it concludes.In Japan the “Itsuki no Komoriuta,” or “Lullabies of Itsuki,” are the songs of young girls who were sent to work as live-in nannies for wealthier families in the village of Itsuki during the century before WWII. “Nobody will shed tears when I die. Only cicadas on the persimmon tree will cry” are lyrics from a well-known Itsuki lullaby.A few years ago, in the Philippines, I sang a lullaby for the first time to my stepson, who was four years old at the time. The apartment my husband and I had moved into in Manila’s business district was new to him and a wearisome boat ride away from his mother and his home by the seaside on the island of Mindoro. He was frightened when the lights went out. As he started crying, I was sure I was doing everything terribly wrong, denting a relationship that is precious and delicate to me. In panic, I carried him and began to sing “You Are My Sunshine.” On that warm summer night he fell asleep, his tears drying to the hum of the fan. But whose fears had I been assuaging?There is a growing body of research about how lullabies help soothe both caregiver and child. Laura Cirelli, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Toronto, studies the science of maternal song. She found that when mothers sang lullabies, stress levels dropped not just for the baby but for mothers as well. In her most recent work, she found that familiar songs soothed babies the most—more than speaking or hearing unfamiliar songs.A new mother herself, Cirelli sees singing lullabies as a “multimodal experience” shared by mother and child. “It’s not just about the baby hearing music,” she says. “It’s about being held by the mom, having her face very close, and feeling her warm, gentle rocking.”From culture to culture, lullabies “tend to have collections of features that make them soothing or calming,” says Samuel Mehr, director of Harvard University’s Music Lab, which studies how music works and why it exists. The lab’s project, the Natural History of Song, found that people can hear universal traits in music—even when they are listening to songs from other cultures. The project asked 29,000 participants to listen to 118 songs and identify whether it was a healing song, a dance song, a love song, or a lullaby. “Statistically, people are most consistent in identifying lullabies,” he says.In a separate study, Mehr’s lab found that even when infants were listening to lullabies that were not sung by their own caregiver, or were not from their own culture, they were still soothed. “There seems to be some kind of parenting-music connection that is both universal around the world but also old, sort of ancient. This is something that we’ve been doing for a really long time.”The earliest complete record of a lullaby begins, “Little baby in the dark house.” It tells of a “house god” who, disturbed by the screaming of a baby, darkly calls for the child.“They were rather brutal about it,” says Richard Dumbrill, the director of the International Council of Near-Eastern Archaeomusicology at the University of London who translated the 4,000-year-old tablet from Akkadian script. “And indeed, remember, these were brutal times. Human life was very, very cheap. It is possible that by educating their babies in fear, it would bring them to adulthood with reflexes of defense.”The lullaby as a cautionary tale—sleep, or else—is common across cultures. Many and lurid are the child-snatching, child-snacking beasts that await those who resist sleep. The horror in these visions bypasses those too young to understand. But for older children, including those sharing bed spaces, lullabies—like other forms of folklore—are an important means of broadcasting a picture of the world.“I sing to forget the baby’s Pa,” Patience Brooks says with a smile after settling her eight-month-old daughter, Marta, to sleep. Bedtime at Patience’s home in Monrovia, Liberia, is an animated affair. The Mamba Point neighborhood vibrates with music, the scrape of dinnertime, and conversation. Her nighttime tunes are a blend of song, scat, and beatbox known locally as “lie-lies.” Lie-lie songs are creative expressions made up by babies’ caretakers to stop them from crying, to put them to bed, or to entertain. Patience drums against Marta’s back as the pair bump and sway, and the girl falls asleep to her mother’s dance.Sleep, baby, sleep / Sleep, baby, sleep / Momma want to see you sleepy / And then when you sleepy / Momma feel so fine / Momma feel so good / So sleep, sleep / Sleep, baby, sleepFor Patience, a mother of two who gave birth to her first daughter at 13, mothering presents challenges familiar to the estimated three in 10 Liberian teens who have had a baby or been pregnant between the ages of 15 and 19.In this neighborhood, the spaces outside become communal living rooms as neighbors help with the day-to-day tasks of caring for children. Women take turns watching over dozens of children as they play and share, allowing mothers to prepare dinners for their families and spend time at home in the evening after a workday.“Once upon a time …” Patience begins, and the children listen. They take turns making up tales and sing songs together. The tiny space fills with the lore of kings and queens. As night falls, the air is charged with musical refrains of magical creatures and adventures in the woods.Cirelli’s research found that children who share synchronous musical experiences with other people are more likely to offer them support. “If you are singing the same songs as your community members,” Cirelli says, “it’s this cue for kinship and group membership.”Bedtime and lullabies are as diverse as our world. For 10-year-old Zaijan Villaruel, who lives in the Philippines, sleep is dictated by the tides of the sea and his family’s needs. At night he fishes with his father and older brothers and falls asleep to the sound of the waves and the motor of the outrigger boat on the way home.The Philippines is part of the Coral Triangle, with more species of marine life than anywhere else on Earth. Fishing communities like the one where Zaijan and his dad, Umbing Villaruel, live, rely on the sea for sustenance and bear some of the greatest brunt of climate change.Umbing does not want his sons to become fishermen; catches have dwindled drastically in the past decade from overfishing. But because of the lockdown during the pandemic, Zaijan learned to fish to help provide for his family. “He learned to survive in a time of loss,” Umbing says.During the daytime, Zaijan sings songs he learned from the karaoke machine to his two-year-old baby sister, Jazzy, in their home in the province of Bataan. He rocks her gently back and forth, and she falls asleep to a song about a boy hoping for a girl’s tears to dry.In the Philippines, where I am from, the words “Tahan na” are uttered between lullabies. The words often are said to calm a weeping person and translate to “stop crying.” But to say “tahan na” is to also say “feel safe,” “feel still,” and “feel at peace.” Tahanan, the word for “home” in Filipino, is the place where tears subside.Carnegie Hall, the historic music venue in New York City, developed the Lullaby Project in 2011. Based on research that lullabies benefit maternal health, strengthen bonds between parent and child, and aid child development, the project fosters collaborations between professional musicians and new parents to compose personal lullabies for their babies. Since its inception, the project has helped create thousands of lullabies spanning multiple countries, reaching mothers and fathers through hospitals, homeless shelters, programs for young mothers, and correctional facilities. “We are essentially thinking of lullabies as an anchor, in very simple terms, for parents to express their personal hopes, dreams, and wishes for their children and for themselves,” says director of Early Childhood Programs Tiffany Ortiz, who oversees the Lullaby Project.“Many mothers will actively talk about using lullaby songs, chants, as a way of reestablishing home,” says Dennie Palmer Wolf, a research consultant for the Lullaby Project. Migrant families in Greece participated in the Carnegie project, and local collaborators describe their lullabies as “portable sanctuaries.”“Like prayers or traditional stories, you can carry them anywhere with you,” Palmer Wolf says. “They take no room in your backpack; you can always pack them in. It’s a way of establishing continuity where there is almost none.”Lullabies reflect the present, but they are often rooted in the past.In Mongolia the buuvei lullaby has been sung by nomads for generations. Its refrain, “buuvei,” means “don’t fear.” “Love is the most important thing—passed on like a heritage,” Bayartai Genden, a Mongolian traditional singer and dancer, and grandmother of 13, tells us as she describes “the magic of giving love to your child through melodies.”Bayartai laments the smog that covers Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar, a barrier between herself and her ancestors. “Our ancestors from the blue sky must be crying because of the air pollution,” she says. “The sky used to be blue.” Bayartai sings a lullaby to her newborn grandson. An air purifier hums in the background.In Ulaanbaatar, one of the world’s coldest capitals, winter is marked not only by temperatures that can reach minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit but also by toxic air. Coal-burning power plants and families using coal to heat their homes cause hazardous levels of air pollution, sometimes more than a hundred times the safe limit set for fine particulate matter by the World Health Organization.With more than half of Mongolia’s children living in Ulaanbaatar, where pneumonia is the second leading cause of death of children under age five, UNICEF declared that the city’s air pollution has become a child health crisis.“I use these words to protect my children. They help my children heal,” Oyunchimeg Buyankhuu says of the lullabies she sang when her two daughters were often sickened by the pollution. Her family moved out of the city so her children could breathe fresher air. Oyunchimeg sings the traditional buuvei lullaby, but between refrains she whispers healing words, reshaping a long-established song for today.In turbulent times stories bring us together. As the COVID-19 pandemic began altering life worldwide, physical distancing drastically changed the way we connect. Women make up nearly 70 percent of health and social service workers globally. For mothers working on the front lines of the pandemic, putting themselves at risk to care for their communities comes with the challenge of how best to care for their own families.Elizabeth Streeter, a nurse in Massachusetts, works on the COVID-19 floor of her hospital. As the pandemic escalated, she made the difficult decision to isolate from her four boys in early April, to avoid exposing them to the virus. She stayed in an RV outside of her parents’ home for a month while her husband stayed home to care for their children. During the evenings, Elizabeth connected with her family over the phone. She would sing her three-year-old son’s favorite lullaby while fighting through tears, unclear about when she might get to hold him again.“To separate such a sacred bond between mother and child, there are no words,” she says in a journal post on Facebook. For Elizabeth, making her children safe meant being physically present. But to serve her community during the pandemic, that has shifted. These days, living away from her children has become her way of keeping them safe. “It looks entirely different than what I always thought protection looked like.”Allison Conlon, a nurse from Bridgewater, Massachusetts, who works in a hospital’s intensive care unit, also separated from her family. At night she called Lucas, two, to read to him and sing “The Wheels on the Bus” and “Itsy-Bitsy Spider” before he went to bed. On Sundays she visited her family’s home but did not enter, instead reading stories to him through a glass storm door. From her side of the glass, Allison gave her son a high five and a kiss. “My son was so resilient and adapted to the change very well, and for that I am super thankful,” she says.To sing a lullaby to someone is to make a connection. The songs connect caregiver to child, but perhaps less noticeably, they also tell stories that connect us to our past, and to each other. Bayartai Genden describes the lullaby as “an exchange of two souls.”Lullabies are part of the fabric from which caregivers create safe spaces that are necessary for dreams to unfold. Khadija al Mohammad says Ahmad reaches out for her lullabies “not only to sleep but to feel my tenderness.” These songs remind us that we are not alone, and in the dark of night, they seem to hold a promise that on the other side waits the light of morning.",
"“War arrives suddenly, uninvited, and brings with it a new normal,” writes Rania Abouzeid in No Turning Back, her poignant account of the Syrian conflict. Following the lives of a group of people from rebel-held areas over a period of five years, she brings home to us what television coverage rarely can: the human dimension of one of the most violent and complicated conflicts since World War II.Speaking from her U.K. publisher’s office in London, she explains how children learn the vocabulary, and sounds, of war; how the CIA armed rebel groups and used them to spy on jihadists; and why she believes the West should be providing more humanitarian aid to Syrians.I’ve been covering the Middle East and Southeast Asia for over 15 years, including a number of different conflicts. I covered the Tunisia uprising, the Egyptian Revolution, and made my way to Damascus in late February 2011 to get an idea of how the Syrian capital was responding to the momentous events that were happening. I witnessed one of the first protests, outside the Libyan Embassy, which was one of the biggest and earliest attempts by Syrians to push the boundaries in a state that had been governed by an emergency law since the 1960s. From that moment, I focused on Syria.I knew that whatever was going to happen there would affect the whole Middle East.I learned in the summer of 2011 that I was blacklisted by Damascus, but not as a journalist. They considered me a spy working for several foreign states. I was wanted by three of the four main intelligence agencies and banned from entering the country. That forced me to focus on the rebel side, which meant being smuggled across the Turkish border into northern Syria. I did that for years, and even though I was banned by Damascus I managed to make two trips, one in 2013 and one in 2016, to government-held parts of Syria. It wasn’t easy. It’s a very vicious war, so it was a difficult story to report.I am not being sympathetic, I am not being judgmental, I am just presenting the information and leaving it up to the readers. My goal is not to characterize, demonize, patronize, or glorify anybody. My interest is to understand. I want to understand a person’s motivations, their worldview, and see what makes them tick. I believe very strongly in the intelligence of the readers. You don’t need to bang them over the head with how terrible a person might be, because it’s evident from their actions.Mohammad is a man who was radicalized at an early age and spent a number of stints in prison, which only served to further radicalize him. In 2011, he saw an opportunity to take revenge against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. He worked to push what was a peaceful revolution in a very different direction, along with other like-minded men.In following his story and three al Qaeda characters, you see how the revolution was Islamized and the roles that organizations like al Qaeda played on the battlefield and also politically. Mohammad committed war crimes that he admits to, and is proud of. But it’s not about me liking or disliking; it’s about presenting information.Ruha was nine years old in 2011. The first time the reader sees her, she is opening the door to a dawn military raid on her family home because they’re looking for her father, who was a protestor. She’s a very precocious young girl who was absorbing what was happening around her, even though her parents tried to hide things from her. But they couldn’t. Children very quickly learned and this was reflected in the games they played and the terminology they came to understand. For example, they learned what a mortar sounds like or the difference between a sniper’s bullet and an anti-aircraft gun. The local version of cops and robbers became revolutionaries versus regime thugs. They also started incorporating the language they were hearing into their games and activities.Ruha then became a refugee. She and her family escaped from Syria because her youngest sister, three-year-old Tarla, had an odd hormonal problem, which the few doctors left in town told her parents was brought about by fear. There were no specialists in their area so they escaped to seek medical treatment.Another of your main characters, Suleiman, was from a good, middle-class family, wasn’t he? Explain how he gets sucked into the conflict and his, and other rebels’, use of social media.Suleiman was a privileged young man who had things most young men want. He had a good job, a lot of money, and came from a family that had connections to the regime. He was also aware of his privilege and when the revolution started, in March 2011, Suleiman took to the streets because he felt that others deserved these same opportunities that he had. So he became a civil activist, documenting the weekly protests in his hometown using his smartphone and uploading them to social media, the same way that many thousands of Syrians did, to try and show the world what was happening in their homeland.The U.S. fully entered the conflict in 2013. Tell us about Timber Sycamore and the espionage work of the Hazm militia.The U.S. had been there from the beginning, but not in a leading role. Timber Sycamore was the code name for the CIA effort to arm the rebels, which came into being in late 2013. One of the first rebel groups to be vetted by the CIA was a group called the Hazm Movement and I outline, for the first time, in this book some of the group’s clandestine work.Hazm was one of the many rebel groups operating in Northern Syria. It had formed from the remnants of a much bigger group called the Farouq Brigades. That group splintered and from those splinters emerged the Hazm Movement. They were non-Jihadist and advocated a civil state in Syria. The espionage involved mapping out the foreign fighters and trying to find out who they were and what they were up to, because their idea for a future Syria didn’t match Hazm’s.Bandar is a university student in Homs when you first see him in the book. He was a roommate with one of my four main characters, a man called Abu Azzam, who ends up becoming a commander in the Farouq Battalions. Bandar didn’t want to participate in the protest. He disliked the regime of President Bashar al-Assad but feared retribution if he participated—not necessarily against himself, but against his family. He tried to stay away from the initial protests, even though his brother had picked up a gun and fought alongside his roommate Abu Azzam. Bandar watched it from a distance initially. He was from Eastern Syria, near Raqqa, so after Homs fell, he moved to Raqqa and watched the black flags come up and how the city, which was one of his adopted hometowns, changed in ways that both terrified and disgusted him.I put hope in the subtitle because some of the people in the book haven’t given up hope. They’re still struggling and trying to rebuild their communities, as well as their lives. It was important to show that, even in the grimmest, darkest, bloodiest wars, there are still people who just want to live, and fight for that right, and cling to the things are singular to their culture and identity, like where they’re from, their families, their dreams. These are the building blocks of the communities. Every life is consequential because it’s part of the mosaic of society. That’s true when that mosaic is unravelling; but it also works when that mosaic is being woven back together again.I want readers to experience the book the way the characters experienced the realities on the ground. I want to place readers there, to give them a sense of what it was like for the people who were living it. They’re all real people, there are no composite characters, and they went through things that most of us, if we’re lucky, can’t even imagine. I want to covey that with as much immediacy as I can.All civil conflicts eventually end. The question is: When and how many more people have to die until you get to that end point? The Syrian conflict is no longer solely about Syrians. It’s a complicated, international battlefield with Russians, Americans, Turks, and Saudis, the Gulf states and Iranians. The outcome has more or less been decided, in the sense that Assad is not going anywhere. He has no reason to negotiate his own demise, especially as he’s making gains on the battlefield, thanks to his allies. But the war is by no means over. Syria is a very fragmented state and it’ll still take many years to put it back together, in whatever form that eventually takes.That’s not a question for me to answer. I’m not on the opinion pages, and I try to stay off them. But the humanitarian need is massive, and it is woefully underfunded, whether inside Syria or for the refugees. It has been called the gravest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II. Politics aside, just help on the humanitarian level. Start with that.A portion of the earnings from No Turning Back will be given to Inara, a nonsectarian charity that provides medical care for children.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk.

"As an emergency medicine doctor, Jacinta Cooper didn’t always make it home in time to participate in nightly rituals with her two daughters. So she’d FaceTime as much as she could before saying good night.But after the pandemic hit, the first few times Cooper FaceTimed home, one-year-old Ruby didn’t recognize her mom behind a mask. “She usually giggles and reaches for the phone, but she didn’t,” Cooper recalls. “It made me kind of sad. It’s already hard being away from them and working through this pandemic.”Ruby now understands that it’s Mom behind the mask, and the important FaceTime ritual continues when she’s not at their Atlanta home. But one bedtime ritual never varies. Always, after the kids have been fed, bathed, pj’d, and read a bedtime story, dad Jeremy Reneau has four-year-old Liyla repeat or recite an affirmation he created when she was about two years old:“I am smart.” “I am strong.” “I am brave.” “I am beautiful.” “I can do anything.”Reneau said he wants his daughters to grow up knowing they matter to their family and the outside world. “I wanted something to help her know what was valuable about her and how valuable she is,” he says.Rituals—from lullabies to bedtime stories to simply saying “I love you” before bedtime—are important for children and their caregivers, providing physical and mental health benefits. But they’re especially important during the stressful times we’re living through.“Children and adults thrive on consistency and routines,” says pediatrician Ari Brown, spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “And with our current pandemic, this is even more important than ever as it makes children feel in control by having a stable wind-down routine.”And at a time when adults have so much to worry about—health scares and economic worries, for instance—kids might feel like they’re taking a backseat to the pandemic. But bedtime rituals put those concerns, well, to rest, Brown says.“It sends a message to your child that nothing else is more important than them,” Brown says. “All the work and chores of the day are set aside and these precious quiet moments tell your child they have your full undivided attention.”Even in “normal times,” bedtime rituals are an important factor in maintaining a child’s physical health. Brown, co-author of the Baby 411 book series, says that the routine helps prepare the brain and body for sleep, which results in a better night’s rest.“A restorative night's sleep helps the brain and body function optimally the next day,” Brown says, calling that the most obvious benefit of sleep. Less obvious? Sleep is when a child’s body grows. “So more sleep means optimal growth. And … when the brain is tired, it’s more distracted. Some sleep-deprived kids get misdiagnosed as having ADD.”The routines can also help children learn to calm themselves, which slows down their breathing and lowers their heart rate.“A child needs to know how to go from the go-go-go tempo of daily life to … a calmer state,” says education researcher Dennie Palmer Wolf.That’s something that’s particularly important now, as children deal with stress from the pandemic. But other benefits derived from bedtime rituals can help with COVID-19 tension, too.“Rituals add predictability and a sense of stability in unpredictable times,” says Tiffany Ortiz, director of early childhood programs at Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, which developed the Lullaby Project, an international initiative that promotes writing and singing of lullabies to support maternal health, child development, and bonding between parents and children.They can also send a message of resilience, Wolf says, especially those songs and practices passed down through generations.“Rituals carry with them the subtle message that we have a longer history than this moment,” she says. “We will continue. We have continuity. This is the song my grandmother sang to my mother, and I share it with you. We have prevailed.”Ortiz agrees: “Hopes and dreams right now are so important as we try to navigate this time and think about the future for our children.”Although people typically think of advantages for children, the benefits of bedtime rituals for caregivers are just as important. For instance, Ortiz notes that downtime moments to connect with children can be stress reducers for caregivers who are zonked with Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting.“Stress translates, so if you’re a parent and going through a stressful situation or dealing with many stresses, that translates to the child,” she says. “We often encourage parents to find moments when they can use breathing, singing, and/or listening exercises with music to soothe. Singing together is a great way for parents and their young ones to connect.”In fact, a study of the Lullaby Project, which also offers a catalog of lullabies from around the world for caregivers and children, found that participating mothers felt a greater sense of connection, achievement, and purpose and more positive emotions when engaged in lullabies with their children.Wolf, a lead researcher on the study, says that those rituals give a break from the stresses of the day to both child and caregiver. “It’s a kind of oasis,” she says. (Find out what the lullabies we sing to our children reveal about us.)Lullabies and bedtime stories are common bedtime rituals, but parents often come up with their own. And the routines don’t have to be at bedtime for children to get the same benefits. What’s most important, Wolf says, is consistency, so that the child learns to expect and depend on the regularity and comfort derived from the ritual.For instance, after the pandemic relaxed the normally strict bedtime hours in the Southfield, Michigan, home of Autumn and Justin Price, they came up with a new morning ritual: hot chocolate for their three children, ages 13, 9, and 7.“Right now I’m big on trying to comfort them,” says Autumn Price, a speech and language pathologist. “I guess I feel like I have to compensate because there’s so much they can’t do anymore.”And why hot chocolate? “Right at the beginning of the pandemic, I heard that hot stuff kills the virus. So I went and bought a giant tub of hot chocolate,” she says. “I know it doesn’t kill the virus. But they love it, and we’ve just continued.”Danielle Rice, a yoga teacher and infant mental health instructor in Detroit, regularly includes a few moments of morning yoga poses with her three-year-old son, Elijah.“It helps us become more attuned to each other,” she says. “It gives us a chance to connect with each other and shut the world out. It makes me feel less pressure and I’m more engaged with him, which improves my efficacy as a parent.“It’s also fun for him. We can’t go to Chucky E. Cheese or Legoland right now, so this is a way to have fun in the house.”Rice has a nightly ritual as well, allowing Elijah to choose one toy to play with for five minutes before a nightly prayer, followed by bedtime.For the Hallett family of Brockton, Massachusetts, their nightly ritual is a dance party. After cleaning up from dinner, they put on some good dance music and jam.It’s not just fun—dancing to and listening to music is also a way to share their culture, whether through the old-school R&B that dad Anthony Hallett puts on, or the island music or Kompa—reggae-like genre popular in her native Haiti—that Jessica Blass-Hallett leans toward. Even if their two children don’t know the language in the songs, they pick up the meaning, she says.“We can have a good time no matter what’s going on outside the four walls,” says Blass-Hallett, a second-grade teacher. “Aside from pure enjoyment, it helps us bond as a family.”",
"When Lynn Zakeri learned that her two sons would be missing out on the fall of their freshman and senior years of high school amid the pandemic, the licensed clinical social worker was concerned about how they’d cope with another setback. Her youngest son already missed his eighth-grade graduation in the spring, and her eldest had spent months training for his upcoming varsity soccer season.Zakeri felt heartbroken for them, but when she asked how they felt about the news, she was pleasantly surprised by their optimistic attitudes. After all, according to a recent systematic review in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, children and adolescents are at higher risk of experiencing feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of isolation from peers, teachers, and extended family.When it comes to our children’s mental health, we can’t really see their internal states—that’s why it’s important to ask and listen rather than simply assume we know how they feel, Zakeri says. “I think always playing the role of questioner is better than us playing the role of the definer.”And while it’s normal for kids to sometimes feel fear, anxiety, and sadness, checking in regularly can help you recognize when they need extra support, especially as they deal with events that few have ever experienced. Here’s what the experts say about talking to your kids about their mental health.Children and adolescents often learn how to identify, express, and manage their emotions by observing their parents’ emotional displays—something called modeling.So how can you be an effective role model? “One of the things I recommend to parents is to first check in with their own mental health,” says Carla Marin, a licensed child and adolescent psychologist who specializes in anxiety-related disorders at the Yale School of Medicine.“It’s like when you’re in the airplane, and they tell you to put on that mask first before you help other people,” she says. “What are the stressors in your life? Do you have a support system in place that you can talk to? Are you able to identify symptoms of anxiety and depression?” Parents need to manage their own emotions before they can respond to their children’s mental health needs.Anxiety is one of the most common mental health conditions in children. In addition to feelings of fear and worry, children may display physical symptoms like fatigue, stomachaches, and headaches. But Marin cautions against reinforcing avoidant behaviors. For instance, if a child is afraid to sleep alone, you should encourage them to do so anyway. “If the parent allows the child to avoid a scenario or situation that they know cannot really harm them, it sends the unspoken message to the child that this is something that they should be worried about,” she explains. “That actually puts them at risk for developing an anxiety disorder later on.”Changes in behavior may also be signs of depression or anxiety, says Kathryn Lige, a social worker in the Student Success Program at the Child Mind Institute. Younger kids might throw tantrums, become easily tearful, clingy, or ask frantic questions. Older children and adolescents may show changes in sleep, appetite, physical and social activity, irritability, low motivation, and lack of energy.Parents should also look for signs of physical and emotional self-harm, Lige says. Some kids might pick at their skin, pull out their hair, self-inflict wounds, or drink alcohol and use drugs. Emotional self-harm includes negative self-talk or feelings of worthlessness—this can easily go undetected if parents aren’t asking questions.Parents can also help children learn how to articulate these difficult emotions. In fact, another component of effective modeling is helping your kids label what they’re feeling—this starts as early as preschool.Lige recommends using visual aids to help children develop this vocabulary early. For example, you might look at emojis, picture books, or movies, then connect a character’s facial expression with an emotion. (“Cinderella looks sad when she finds out she’s going to miss the ball.”)When young children can’t verbally express what they’re feeling, they might act out, throw temper tantrums, or withdraw. If your child appears upset or overwhelmed, Marin advises against punishing or ignoring them. Check in, help them calm down, and put a name to their emotions. (“It looks like something is upsetting you right now. Let’s take a deep breath. You can tell Mom or Dad what’s bothering you.”) You can also model this by talking about your own emotions and problem-solving strategies—just remember to use language that’s age-appropriate for your child.It’s just as important to have these talks with older children and adolescents. “Having normal conversations around feelings and emotions and just making that part of family discussions really destigmatizes it,” Marin says. She recommends asking your child how they’re feeling regularly, not just bringing it up when you think there’s a problem.Asking questions is just the first step—your kids also want to feel heard.“It’s important that you recognize that your child is feeling the way that they’re feeling—even if it seems to you somewhat irrational,” Marin says. “Support comprises two components—validating how the child is feeling, but also instilling a sense of self-sufficiency. Say ‘Hey, you just told me that this is really bothering you. I hear you. I understand that this is upsetting, but I think you can also cope with it. Let’s talk about it some more.’”Lige recommends using active listening skills. Avoid distractions when you’re talking to your kids, and give them verbal and physical cues to show you’re listening. That means putting down the phone, turning off the TV, making eye contact, nodding your head, and asking follow-up questions.Timing also matters. “If they have their headphones on or they're in the middle of chatting with friends, all they want to do is let you talk and get back to what they’re doing,” Zakeri says. She suggests carving out time to talk to your kids during activities they also want to do, like taking a walk, going for a drive, or baking cookies together.Zakeri stresses the importance of listening and validating whatever your child shares with you without being dismissive or judgmental. “Children have to be safe to say things that are negative—that’s OK, we all have negative feelings,” she says. “If you only reassure your kids that everything is fine when they tell you it’s not, your kids are going to stop coming to you.”That also means keeping a cool head during difficult conversations. “A kid doesn’t want to worry their parents. They want to know that whatever they put out there, you can handle,” Zakeri says. If you’re struggling to manage your own feelings, she recommends talking to a therapist. “Put all your angst and anxiety on other people who can hold it for you—but your kids can’t.”It’s normal for kids to experience negative emotions, especially during major transitions like the ones we’ve experienced during the pandemic, Lige says. But when these symptoms are severe, interfere with daily life, or last more than a few weeks, parents should consider talking to an expert about screening and evidence-based treatments.“Mental and emotional concerns can get better with professional help,” Marin says. "Just like we go to a medical doctor to treat a physical ailment, we need to see mental health on the same plane as physical illness.”If you decide to seek expert help, she recommends being honest with your child while using age-appropriate language. (“Mommy and daddy have noticed you seem sad lately, so we want you to meet with someone who can help you feel better.”) If a child refuses to participate, Marin says not to feel discouraged—a mental health provider can still work with you and recommend strategies to help your child.Finally, remember that your kids are watching how you express and manage your emotions and modeling their behavior after you. That’s why it's equally important to get help for yourself when you need it, Lige says. “If your child is struggling, you’re not going to be able to attend to them if you’re struggling.”",
"When New York writer Nora Zelevansky learned her six-year-old daughter was playing “hotel restaurant,” the details surprised her. “She said that everyone needed to be laid off, that she was going to get fired too, that there wouldn’t be enough money, and that one of her stuffed animals was hoarding food,” Zelevansky says. “Usually her stuffies are donning capes to save the world or dressed up for birthday parties. They’re not getting fired from their jobs.”Parents are understandably concerned about the impacts of COVID-19 on their children’s own mental health. They have good reason. Kids already have a hard enough time regulating feelings because the frontal lobe (the part of the brain that controls rational thought) develops through adolescence. But research also shows that trauma—like intensified fear surrounding a life-changing event such as the pandemic—can affect brain formation, leading to problems with regulating emotions later in life.“Studies are starting to show that when we’re more positive, it increases interconnectivity between nerves in the brain,” says Ashok Shimoji-Krishnan, a child and adolescent psychiatrist for Kaiser Permanente in Factoria, Washington. That means kids’ brains work better when they’re thinking positively. So kids who are in a positive frame of mind are more able to handle, say, a tricky distance-learning assignment.Positive thinking also increases the levels of feel-good hormones like serotonin and norepinephrine, which prime the brain to seek more of the same positive vibes. “By being positive, we promote more positivity down the road,” Shimoji-Krishnan says. Here are some ideas from the experts on maintaining your child’s positive outlook.Zelevansky tried hard to shield her two children from scary details. “But I had no idea how much they were absorbing,” she says. The trick is to look for subtle signs that your kids might be sliding into negative thinking.“Anxiety looks different in kids than adults,” says developmental psychologist Cynthia Smith, director of graduate studies for the Department of Human Development and Family Science at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. “You might see kids being more emotional and clingy, or asking a lot of questions.”Shimoji-Krishnan, who‘s also the child mental health lead for Kaiser Permanente—Washington Region, agrees. “Younger kids might be more overt, with more tantrums, whining, and crying. They might be more on edge. They might question a bit more, argue a bit more.”Older kids will likely show subtler signals. "They might not be interacting as much with the family, playing their favorite video games, or hanging out with their friends online,” Shimoji-Krishnan says. “You might see more withdrawal, quietness, irritability, and emotionality.”Yet all kids seem to have one reaction in common. “Kids who are sliding down into negativity might not sleep as much, or oversleep all the time,” Shimoji-Krishnan says. “Some kids might eat a lot more than usual. They might crave sweets or carbs. Or they might not want to eat as much.”The most important thing parents can do may be the hardest: staying positive themselves. Shimoji-Krishnan says it's critical to try to manage moods when we’re with our children because mood is, well, contagious.“Kids feed off what they see,” he says. “It’s really important that parents take the time to check themselves. If parents can’t keep themselves calm, they’re going to struggle with calming anyone else down.” As a father of young children, Shimoji-Krishnan acknowledges that this can be tricky. He suggests reaching out to a partner or friend, or grabbing a moment to process things before you interact with children.Then, just do what you’ve been doing: Make yourself available.“For younger children, playing games with them will mean a lot because they’re missing out on the classroom socialization,” says Smith, who’s also the head of Virginia Tech’s Children’s Emotions Lab. “Try to find some dedicated time to be with them, and let them take the lead. Asking, ‘What would you like to do?’ gives them a sense of control when everything feels a bit out of control.”Through play, kids will often act out what they’re feeling or thinking. “So you can comment, ‘I noticed you're playing that someone is stuck in the house. What were you thinking about?’” Shimoji-Krishnan says. "That can be an opportunity for kids to comment in a really neutral way without pressure to answer.”If your child doesn’t have much to say, that’s OK. “Let them talk at their pace,” Shimoji-Krishnan adds. That goes especially for teens. “If you overstep your boundaries, they’ll shut down,” he says. Instead, find out what they need. “Say, ‘I’m really glad you want to talk to me. Do you want me to listen, brainstorm with you, or offer suggestions?' That way, you know what the guardrails are.”Keeping up a routine, even a loose one, can make a big difference too. “Kids might be acting out because they’re out of their routines,” Smith says. “They’re missing their teachers, they’re missing their schools.”Shimoji-Krishnan emphasizes scheduling—not overscheduling. “Just something that tells kids what the plan is can be helpful—like, ‘We have TV time here or an art project here,’” he says. “And have breaks with open time.”One idea for keeping kids positive is to help them practice gratitude. “That’s one of the best ways to change their mindset,” says Fimi Haddadian, a school psychologist and co-founder of Bluejack Kids, a center for social emotional learning for elementary students in Encino, California. In fact, multiple studies show that feeling gratitude might also boost heart health, make people happier, and even improve sleep.Haddadian recommends that right before bed, kids name three things they're grateful for from the day. Teens might want to keep a gratitude journal.Helping others is an easy way to reverse negativity. According to a 2017 study from the journal BMC Public Health, volunteering is directly related to better mental health and less depression. “Every day at 2 p.m., my 12-year-old daughter does a virtual art activity with her five- and six-year-old cousins,” Haddadian says. “She feels like she’s helping the kids, and they look forward to it.” Parents can also consider having kids write letters or draw pictures to seniors in nursing homes or children in hospitals, sew non-medical masks to donate, or clear out a closet for items to give to a family shelter. (Here's what you should know about DIY masks and ventilators.)Parents can also encourage kids to replace negative thoughts with alternative positive ones. “Have kids write down the negative thought on a balloon,” Haddadian says. “Then they pop it and replace the thought with a healthier one.” So if the first thought was “My friends will forget about me,” the positive replacement might be “I can call my friends now, and we’ll be back together as soon as it's safe.” Kids are literally popping away the negative thought and reinforcing the positive.Children can even give their negative inner voice a name. “It’s a way to become conscious of it,” Haddadian says. “I call mine ‘Bertha.’ So I’ll say, ‘Oh, there’s Bertha again, telling me to feel scared.’” A child might respond, “Bertha, I’m strong. I can get through this.”And in a really panicky moment, parents can help kids with a simple breathing exercise, which can calm them down and make room for positive thoughts. “Pretend you’re smelling the flowers, then blowing out birthday candles,” Haddadian says.Zelevansky has been doing guided meditations with her kids at night and says that's helped, as have regular chats. “The truth is that we all have good days and bad during this,” she says. “So all we can do is keep giving them hugs. And I try to tell them several times a day: You are safe.”",
"Last week in Chicago, a 14-year-old made a list of family members he thought were likely to live and those likely to die. In Cincinnati, a six-year-old worried that if he couldn’t celebrate his birthday with his friends, he wouldn’t get any older. Meanwhile, my three-year-old daughter has had more bathroom accidents in the past few days than she previously had so far this year.The physical symptoms of the novel coronavirus are well documented. The mental health effects, less so. And though children are less likely to become ill, we’re only starting to understand what the pandemic might mean for children’s mental health and emotional well-being.It’s a lot for a kid to process. There’s the disruption of normal activities, the sudden split from friends, and, of course, fear of the virus itself. These difficulties are compounded for children who rely on school meals, or whose family members are sickened or facing sudden unemployment.So how can we help our children during this time of change and uncertainty? Here’s what mental health professionals and parenting experts have to say about what they’ve been seeing and how we, as parents, can help.The response to the pandemic among kids spans the spectrum. Some are enjoying the novelty of time off from school, while others are experiencing what Chicago-based clinical psychologist John Duffy described as “a level of fear approaching terror.”“What kids are telling me is that they are afraid of the unknown,” says Duffy, author of Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety.“They feel this kind of foreboding, that something awful is about to happen. And they feel they have a limited agency over it.”Experts are also seeing some differences between younger and older kids, as well as children who might already be dealing with depression and anxiety.Parents of younger children might notice clinginess or regressions, such as more bathroom accidents or comfort-seeking behaviors like thumb sucking. The disruption of routine can be especially difficult for young children, who take great comfort in consistency.Parents of older children should expect mood swings and irritability. For them, social distancing might be the real hardship. “Tweens and teens steady themselves emotionally in relationship to each other,” Duffy says. The separation from peers can feel “wretched” and unnatural.Kids are hyperaware of their own bodies, along with the safety of themselves and their family members, said Rachel Herbst, a psychologist who leads integrated behavioral health services in primary care at Cincinnati Children's hospital. And they’re picking up on stress felt by adults around them. “Anxiety is far more contagious than any virus, and kids are going to soak that up,” she said.Parents of children who have been previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety might find this pandemic especially challenging. It doesn’t help that methods encouraged for protection—constant handwashing and sanitizing—are anxiety provoking themselves. There’s an element of obsessiveness and compulsive thinking just in being safe, Duffy said.“No matter how measured we try to be, some kids will be super sensitive to that message and will need help recalibrating when the acute crisis has passed,” said Tara Peris, associate professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. Peris is also co-director of UCLA’s Childhood OCD, Anxiety and Tic Disorders Program.Anxiety is often approached as a response that occurs in the absence of threat. But in this case, some of the threats are very real. This means some of the standard responses to anxious thinking may need tweaking, Peris says. “What I’ve found myself saying to kids who were struggling with anxiety and depression before this is, ‘You are allowed to be anxious in response to a scary and new situation. Your emotions are there for a reason, and our anxiety is natural and normal and necessary.’” The key, she said, is finding a useful way to manage it.Fortunately, evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression can help kids recognize and tackle worrisome thoughts, practice new coping skills during difficult situations, and soothe physical symptoms. And they're not limited to kids who are prone to anxiety—these are strategies we could all use right now, Peris said.As we move forward in this strange new normal, here are some other suggestions from the experts on how we can help our kids’ mental health.Modeling is so important now, said Ty Hatfield, co-author of ParentShift: Ten Universal Truths That Will Change the Way You Raise Your Kids and co-founder of the parenting program Parenting From the Heart. Kids learn from us how to manage stress and solve problems when things are difficult.Parents, this means taking care of yourself. If you can find time, exercise. Take a hot bath. Listen to music. Read a book. Whatever works for you. And manage your consumption of news and social media.“Watching the news is not self care,” Hatfield said.It doesn’t need to be color coded in 15-minute intervals with flash cards and French lessons and mind-numbing crafts. But structure makes kids feel safe, especially during times of upheaval.“Don’t be militant with the schedule,” Peris said. “We’ve all had kids crash our calls and pop up on Zoom. This is going to be real life in all its glory. But a consistent routine is a thing parents can do to preserve everybody’s mental health in a big way.”For younger kids, be short and to the point. Let the child’s questions guide the conversation. But be honest, Duffy said: “Kids will become more anxious at any age if they sense you’re not forthcoming.”Tell them what you do and don’t know. But balance that with the comfort that lots of people are working on this, and social distancing is effective at managing it. Reassure them that they’re safe and protected.Most importantly, says Linda Hatfield, co-author of ParentShift and co-founder of Parenting From the Heart, acknowledge their feelings. For example: “It sounds like you’re worried you might get sick.” Or, “I imagine you’re sad that you don’t get to play with your friends today.”“Children are a bundle of feelings,” she says. “When you communicate with them through feeling language, it helps them feel heard and seen and understood. It helps them feel like their world makes sense, like the other person gets them.”This is not the time to demonize screens. Parents need to lean on them to get work done. And screens can provide a badly needed source of connection and comfort.Michelle Icard, author of the book Middle School Makeover, runs a Facebook group with parents of middle schoolers. And in the past week, she’s noticed an interesting trend among that age group: a return to movies and television shows from earlier childhood. PBS cartoons, for example, or the movie Annie. “I think this is such an uncertain time, and there’s great comfort in going back to these things of childhood,” Icard said.Still, too much time on screens could leave kids feeling agitated and anxious, Duffy says. He recommends no more than two hours a day, at the margins of the day. Duffy’s one exception: the family movie. “If the family is all together watching a movie, you’re going to create some in-jokes, some memories that might create some resilience over time,” he said.“The counterbalance to screen time is movement and physical activity,” Duffy said. So get outside. Walk. Run. Play tag. Build forts. Embrace imaginative outdoor play.“I encourage adults to consider what happens when we look at screens for an extended period of time,” Duffy said. “You can sense the tension and agitation after doing that. And the relief we feel when we put them down and engage in another way is so healthy, crucial, and important.”The good news is that, from a mental health perspective, we might experience some silver linings to what’s happening now, said Emily King, a licensed psychologist in Raleigh, North Carolina, who specializes in autism, ADHD, and anxiety.U.S. children are overscheduled, which can lead to stress and fatigue, she said. Children with autism especially may benefit from taking a break from the public school day, which can be overwhelming and perhaps even too long.In order to keep our families healthy, we’re all being asked to slow down and reevaluate, she said. “This may bring us all back to baseline in understanding what’s really important.”",
"Gretchen Cureton’s nine-year-old daughter Evie has been afraid of needles for as long as either of them can remember. She has cried through every single shot since her newborn immunizations—and she’s had to be held still during doctor’s appointments and routine vaccinations since she was a toddler. But Evie’s needle anxiety rose to new levels last summer.During a family conversation about when kids her age would be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, Evie burst into tears. Although she understood her mother’s explanation that the vaccine will protect her from disease, the thought of facing a needle still filled her with angst.Many kids ages five to 11 nervously awaited their COVID-19 vaccines, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authorized November 2, 2021, for the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for emergency use. Now those kids might be on high alert again, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended COVID-19 vaccines for children six months and older.But it’s this same young age group of five- to 11-year-olds that seems to have particularly prevalent fears and phobias of needles, with two-thirds reporting anxiety compared to about half of older children.While these fears are common, pediatricians and child psychologists say that it’s critical to take them seriously—not just because the fear is valid for the child’s developmental stage, but because kids who don’t learn how to cope with needles become adults who avoid medical care. Fortunately, new research is shedding light on the ways that parents, caregivers, and medical practitioners can help make vaccination a little easier for everyone.There’s nothing particularly shocking about the fact that kids are afraid of needles. After all, says Anna Taddio, a pharmacy professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in pain management, needles are “pointy, sharp, and they hurt.”But for most of human history, science has dismissed that pain. Up until the 1980s, the scientific consensus held that newborn babies don’t perceive pain, and doctors routinely performed surgeries on infants without anesthesia. It wasn’t until 1987 that the New England Journal of Medicine published a study showing that, in fact, infant pain is real.In the years since, research has yielded new insights showing that younger kids are particularly afraid of pain. In 2012, Taddio surveyed children and their parents to determine the prevalence of needle fears in kids. In the survey, 68 percent of kids ages six to eight and 65 percent of kids ages nine to 12 reported a fear of needles. That number dropped to 51 percent among 13- to 17-year-olds.That disparity is caused by several reasons, says Rebecca Pillai Riddell, a clinical psychologist at York University who researches children and pain. For one, younger children are still in the age of magical thinking.“What enables us to believe that Santa and the Tooth Fairy are real also leads us to think that monsters are real and allows us to imprint fears,” she says, explaining that needle phobias tend to develop between ages five and 10 because by that point, kids have figured out that they get poked every time they go to a doctor’s office—but they don’t yet understand that it’s just a routine procedure that will keep them healthy and, more importantly, be over soon. “We don’t have the rational abstract reasoning that tends to happen around 12,” she says.Studies of children’s brains have shown that their frontal lobes, which control cognitive abilities like problem solving, memory, and emotional expression, undergo significant developmental changes as they approach puberty. Pillai Riddell says this cognitive development allows older children to reason and put vaccination in perspective as just a quick prick—not total agony.Young kids also simply don’t have as much exposure to needles and vaccinations as older children and adults. Much like checking under the bed reassures kids that no monsters are hiding there, Pillai Riddell says that children learn there’s nothing to fear about needles the more that they’re exposed to them.But though many children may grow out of their fears as they move through adolescence and gain more experience with vaccinations, it’s not a given. A bad experience with a needle can stick with a child into adulthood—and that can have serious implications. Taddio’s 2012 survey, for example, showed that five percent of parents avoided or delayed immunization in one or more of their children due to the child’s fear of needles. Those unaddressed needle fears may also help explain some of the vaccine hesitancy we see among adults today, Taddio says.Fortunately, she adds, “This is something we can solve.”Sure, kids might get used to the idea of vaccines over time, but whether their fear abates depends on whether their experiences are positive. A growing body of research shows that teaching your children certain coping techniques can set them up for a positive experience even before you step into the doctor’s office.“Parents are probably the most powerful, preventable strategy for pain-related distress,” Pillai Riddell says.Here’s how she and other experts recommend helping your child deal with their fear of needles.Check yourself first. Pillai Riddell suggests that parents and caregivers first reflect on their own anxieties surrounding vaccination before they start teaching their kids how to cope. Parents shape the way their children approach new experiences—particularly young children. When kids see that their parent is anxious about getting a shot, they can be vicariously conditioned to fear it, too. Kids can actually feel their parents’ anxiety: If you’re holding your child during the shot and your heart is racing, Pillai Riddell says your kid’s heart rate is likely to elevate as well.“It just keeps getting modeled over and over again as a scary, distress-provoking experience,” she says.For parents with a true needle phobia, Pillai Riddell suggests seeking treatment so that you don’t pass it on to your child. Otherwise, she says, parents should assess their own anxiety before their child undergoes any kind of medical procedure. If you’re feeling nervous and your heart is racing, take deep breaths or do whatever else you need to help yourself relax.Get them ready. Prepare kids for an immunization ahead of time. For the under-12 set, Pillai Riddell doesn’t recommend preparing a child too far in advance. Instead, she says, on the day of the appointment, talk to your child about what’s going to happen—a pinch that’ll be over by the time they count to five—and remind them of when they’ve gotten through it before. Katie Creager, a nurse practitioner with the Cleveland Clinic, says that children can even practice administering shots to their stuffed animals. (This article explains how parents can talk to kids about why we need vaccines and how they work.)Whatever you do, Creager says, don’t lie. She has seen children whose parents have told them that they’re going out for cupcakes—only to arrive at the doctor’s office for a shot. “That never goes over well,” she says. “Most kids do a lot better if it’s not a giant surprise.”Find out what’s really scaring them. Taddio adds that parents should ask their kids what bothers them about the prospect of getting a shot—and encourage them to ask questions in return. For a child who’s worried the needle will hit their bone or take their blood, answering those questions can be a huge source of relief.“Empower kids to ask about what bothers them,” she says. Even if their concerns seem minor or silly, Taddio points out that they simply don’t have the life experience that adults do—and that their worries are perfectly valid for their developmental stage. “It’s for them to tell us how big a deal it is for them, and for us to help them through,” she says.Put them in control. Both Pillai Riddell and Taddio suggest letting older kids decide what shirt to wear, what arm to get the jab in, what kind of bandage to get, or whether to go out for ice cream or cupcakes afterward. That, they say, gives them a sense of control that can make them more relaxed with the whole situation.Parents can also prepare their kids in advance with coping strategies that they can use to help themselves through the procedure. Taddio recommends kids take deep breaths or repeat affirmations to themselves such as “I can get through this” or “This is hard but I can do it.”“These things can relax us,” she says.Comfort—then distract. When it comes time for the main event, encourage your children to stay calm. Comfort kids by holding their hands or letting them sit on your lap—and then distract them during the shot itself. Depending on their age, Taddio suggests packing a video game or bubbles or talking to your child about something else.Enlist some help. Healthcare providers also have a role to play in helping a child overcome a needle fear, so parents should let them know when a child is particularly afraid. For example, Taddio says practitioners can arrange to administer shots in private if a child is nervous that others might be watching them.They can also help out parents when it comes to comforting and distracting children. Nurses have seen it all, Creager says—and they have all kinds of strategies, from blowing out imaginary birthday candles to pretending to do magic tricks.“We can accommodate you,” Creager says. “Pediatric nurses are so good and everybody is so happy to be able to help.”Give them the gold. After the shot, psychologists encourage parents to use “coping-promoting” language with their kids, such as complimenting their strength or deep breathing technique. Taddio says this reinforces the experience as a positive one—whereas teasing or criticizing a child by saying, for example, that big kids don’t cry will only reinforce their negative feelings.That said, wait a minute—literally—before saying anything. In July, Pillai Riddell and her colleagues at York University published a study of four- to five-year-olds showing that they’re in peak distress during the first minute after receiving a shot—and that encouraging statements actually increase their distress during that minute.“It surprised us but when you think it through, it absolutely makes sense,” Pillai Riddell says. “Imagine you’re in pain and someone tries to make coping-promoting statements. You’re not ready.”Get ready to do it again! Taddio acknowledges that, in the moment, parents won’t always be able to say the exact perfect thing at the exact right moment for their needle-phobic child. But that’s OK—they’ll have more chances to do better in the future. And ultimately, it’s about taking your child’s pain and fears seriously and thinking about it from their perspective.“Adults might think it doesn’t matter because we know these needles aren’t going to cause physical harm,” she says. “But because it matters so much to them, it should matter to us.”Editor’s note: This article was originally published October 25, 2021, and has been updated to include information about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation that children six months and older receive a COVID-19 vaccine.",
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expanded eligibility for booster doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents ages 12 to 15. The announcement comes days after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the expansion to this age group, meaning that shots can now be rolled out immediately.The agencies also authorized booster doses five months after full vaccination rather than the six month interval that was originally authorized. Additionally, they authorized a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 with certain conditions that compromise their immune systems, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants.“It is critical that we protect our children and teens from COVID-19 infection and the complications of severe disease,” said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in a statement. “This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant.”The FDA previously said that the data show that an additional dose may provide better protection against the Omicron and Delta variants and that real-world data from Israel’s vaccination campaign shows no new safety concerns for a booster dose in the younger teenage population, with no new cases of myocarditis or pericarditis reported to date.— Amy McKeever, 1/6/2022● 9 big questions about Omicron explained● Can COVID-19 alter your personality?● Variants will keep coming until everyone can access vaccines● 5 things to know about COVID-19 tests in the age of Omicron● How booster shots can help protect you from OmicronThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded eligibility for booster doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents ages 12 to 15.

Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement that the data show that an additional dose may provide better protection against the Omicron and Delta variants.The FDA also said that real-world data from Israel’s vaccination campaign shows no new safety concerns for a booster dose in the younger teenage population, with no new cases of myocarditis or pericarditis reported to date.In a press conference following the announcement, Marks also urged everyone who has not been vaccinated yet to do so, emphasizing that even a single dose can help prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19. “It’s not too late to start to get vaccinated,” he said.— Amy McKeever, 1/3/2022The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of Merck’s antiviral pill for adults over the age of 18 who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are at high risk for severe disease. The decision comes a day after the agency authorized the emergency use of Pfizer’s antiviral pill for people 12 and older.These drugs work by interfering with the virus’s genome as it multiples, creating mutations that disrupt replication and ultimately kill the virus. In clinical trials, Merck’s drug, called molnupiravir, was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 30 percent.That is a drop in efficacy from Merck’s original announcement that people who took the pill were half as likely to be hospitalized or die than those who took the placebo. It’s also lower than the stated efficacy of Pfizer’s pill, which the company says reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent. It’s unclear how effective either drug will be against the new Omicron variant.The U.S. government has made a deal to purchase about 3.1 million courses of the treatment, most of which will be available by the end of January.

It should be started as soon as possible after a COVID-19 diagnosis and within five days of when a patient begins to show symptoms.— Amy McKeever, 12/23/2021The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of Pfizer’s antiviral pill for adults and children older than 12 who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are at high risk of severe disease. The drug—which has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death—is the first of its kind to be approved for use in the United States.It’s unclear how effective the drug will be against the new Omicron variant. But health officials hailed the FDA authorization as one more tool available to doctors and patients who are fighting the disease.“Today’s authorization introduces the first treatment for COVID-19 that is in the form of a pill that is taken orally—a major step forward in the fight against this global pandemic,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement.As National Geographic has previously reported, these drugs work by interfering with the virus’s genome as it multiples, creating mutations that disrupt replication and ultimately kill the virus.

On December 17, Pfizer announced that it is extending its clinical trials among this age group to test the efficacy of three doses rather than two.The company said that an analysis of its ongoing study found that two doses of the vaccine did not produce a similarly robust immune response in children ages two to five as it did with older age groups. The jab did, however, produce an adequate immune response in children younger than two. There were also no safety concerns identified.Pfizer said it expects to submit data to federal regulators for emergency use authorization of vaccines for children ages six months to five years in the first half of 2022. It will also test the efficacy of a third dose for older children.However, parents who are anxious for the vaccine to be authorized in young children can take solace in another announcement made the same day. Tthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it’s safe for children of all ages who have been exposed to COVID-19 to attend school in person if they are regularly tested for the virus at school.

The agency said that it has new evidence that vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 wanes after the second dose, including among people in this age group. Boosters will help provide continued protection.“As people gather indoors with family and friends for the holidays, we can’t let up on all the preventive public health measures that we have been taking during the pandemic,” said acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock in a statement announcing the decision. “With both the Delta and Omicron variants continuing to spread, vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19.”This population will be eligible to get a booster dose at least six months after they were fully vaccinated. Unlike the mix-and-match approach the agency approved for older populations, however, the FDA has only authorized the boosters for teens who originally received Pfizer’s vaccine.The FDA also said it assessed the safety of the booster doses and determined that the benefits of getting a booster outweigh the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis among people ages 16 and 17.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also signed off on the FDA decision.— Amy McKeever, 12/9/2021Editor’s note: This story has been updated to note the CDC’s approval of the decision.Read more of our coverage on the coronavirus pandemic here.",
"On November 19, the FDA announced that all American adults are now eligible for a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The agency has amended the emergency use authorization of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to allow people over the age of 18 to receive another jab. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on the agency’s recommendations and said the boosters would be available immediately.“COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be the best and highly effective defense against COVID-19,” said FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock in a statement. She added that the booster dose will provide continued protection against hospitalization and death.Booster doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have already been approved for all adults. Previously, the FDA had only authorized third jabs of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for people age 65 and older and people at risk of severe disease, such as adults with underlying conditions or in high-risk jobs.

"On October 21 CDC director Rochelle Walensky issued a ruling that clears the way for booster shots of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to begin rolling out immediately. Anyone 18 and older will be able to get a second dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months after their first dose. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators’ recommendation for the Moderna vaccine is narrower: A third dose can be administered at least six months after the second one to people age 65 and older and to those ages 18 to 64 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. It also includes people ages 18 to 64 who are at high risk of exposure because of where they work or live, such as health-care workers or incarcerated people. These guidelines are the same as those approved for Pfizer’s booster doses.The CDC also endorsed a “mix and match” approach to booster doses, which will, for example, allow people who received a Johnson & Johnson jab to seek a Pfizer or Moderna booster instead. Only people who are eligible for booster doses will be authorized to mix and match. U.S. regulators based the decision on evidence from a new National Institutes of Health study suggesting that booster doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines are more effective for people who originally received the Johnson & Johnson shot.The CDC’s recommendations align with the FDA emergency use authorization that had been issued the previous day.Stay up to date and read more on the latest vaccine developments here.● Why even fully vaccinated older people are at high risk for severe COVID-19● How to confront the pandemic's toll on kids’ mental health● Should you mix and match vaccines?

"As scientists learn what makes Omicron different from other versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, guidance about how to deal with the variant is changing fast. In the U.S., where Omicron is now the dominant variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have come under fire for their shifting guidelines, including a recently updated recommendation that halves the isolation period for people who test positive from 10 days to five.What is the science behind the changing guidance, and how can people best protect themselves as Omicron spreads? Here’s what experts say you need to know.The short answer? Practicality, says Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and internal medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Because Omicron spreads so easily, cases have skyrocketed to more than 540,000 per day for the past seven days. And if hundreds of thousands of people all must isolate for 10 days, it becomes challenging to staff and operate critical businesses, including hospitals.“What do you do if you have 20 percent or more of your healthcare workforce not able to work because they test positive?” says Poland. “You see a rapid rise in death and complications for whoever is in the hospital, because there are an inadequate number of healthcare workers.”But there is also solid science behind the change. Studies have measured the concentration of live (and therefore contagious) virus in the noses of infected people and how levels change over time. They show that a person’s ability to transmit the virus typically peaks between a day or two before symptoms begin and two to three days after, says Jill Weatherhead, an infectious disease expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So five days after a positive test, the amount of virus an infected person sheds drops sharply.The new guidelines are a tradeoff, adds Abraar Karan, an infectious diseases doctor at Stanford University in Palo Alto. “The benefit is that we avoid huge losses in labor capacity,” he says. “The cost is that we send people back when they could still be infectious, although potentially far less so than earlier in their disease course.”Not exactly. The five-day recommendation only applies to people who are asymptomatic or whose symptoms are diminishing at that point.A negative test around the five-day mark also doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in the clear, Karan says. “You could still be infectious, even if you test negative on an antigen test,” Karan says. “But you are likely less contagious than when your antigen was positive.”People who are immunocompromised take longer to get rid of their infections, experts say, and should stay in isolation for up to 20 days. For people who have healthy immune systems and whose symptoms are declining, masking will reduce the risk of transmitting the virus after the fifth day. Even after five days of isolation, people should wear well-fitting, high-quality masks snugly over their mouths and noses.“The idea with the updated guidance is that you're really covered during that peak time of contagiousness to protect from transmitting the virus,” Weatherhead says. “And in case you are a person that continues to shed virus after those five days, continuing to wear a mask will provide another layer of protection to prevent transmission.”To isolate properly and reduce risk, day zero begins when your first symptoms appear, even if you tested positive before symptoms started. Day one is the first full day after your symptoms begin. If you never get symptoms, day one is the first full day after your positive test.Isolation only applies to people who have tested positive, according to the CDC. This means staying away from other people, even other household members, preferably in a “sick room” or area with its own bathroom.If you find out you’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive, the CDC recommends that you quarantine. This also means staying away from others for a while, but the details depend on your vaccination status. If you have been boosted, if you have received your second Moderna shot within the last six months, your second Pfizer shot within the last five months, or if you have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine within the last two months, you don’t need to quarantine, but you should wear a mask around other people for 10 days.If you are unvaccinated or you are not within the recommended time windows for vaccines and boosters, the CDC recommends staying home for five days, then wearing a mask around other people for five more days. If you can’t quarantine, wear a mask for 10 days everywhere you go. Anyone who is a close contact of someone who tests positive should test on day five if possible. And if symptoms appear, get tested and stay home.The answer depends on which type of test you get, among other factors.PCR tests detect genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In some people, genetic remnants can linger in the nose for weeks or even months after the virus is no longer able to cause infections, Weatherhead says. Poland has a colleague who tested positive 16 weeks after their infection began.Rapid antigen tests, on the other hand, detect viral proteins that are produced by live, active viruses. Those types of tests are unlikely to stay positive after levels of the virus are too low to cause infection.A positive test of either kind doesn’t reveal how contagious you are, Weatherhead points out. Even though it may be tempting to interpret a faint line on a rapid test as a decline in infectiousness, faintness could simply be a result of how much virus you managed to pick up with the swab. “You're getting a ‘yes or no’ answer, not a ‘how much’ answer,” she says.Available evidence suggests that yes, they do, Weatherhead says. Sensitivity might be slightly lower with the new variant, the FDA said in a statement in late December. Compared to PCR tests, rapid tests are less likely to detect infections in their earliest stages. But a U.K. Health Security Agency briefing analyzed the performance of rapid antigen tests at detecting Omicron, and it found no change in their performance with Omicron.Theoretically yes, experts say. In a December 2021 study of people infected with several variants, including Delta and Alpha but not Omicron, researchers reported that vaccinated people with breakthrough cases cleared their infections in an average of 5.5 days. By contrast, unvaccinated people took 7.5 days to clear even though peak viral load was the same in both groups. Studies also show that fully vaccinated people are less likely to develop severe cases of COVID-19, including those who catch Omicron.Vaccination “certainly reduces your risk of developing severe disease and requiring hospitalization, because the immune system [is] primed to reduce the viral burden,” Weatherhead says. “Whether that translates into how quickly you convert from a positive antigen test to a negative antigen test, I don't think we have that data yet.”Although many public health experts think it would be a good idea, the CDC is holding firm on its decision not to recommend a negative test before leaving isolation.The best answer might depend on whether you are trying to make policy decisions or individual ones, Poland says. On a population level, it might make sense to require negative tests to prevent potentially infectious children from going to school, for example.But in your personal life, Weatherhead says, what you choose to do depends on your own level of risk tolerance and the vulnerability of people around you. “If you're around people who are unvaccinated or who have underlying health conditions who are at high risk of disease, maybe it's better to take that test or wait the full 10 days beforehand,” she says.If you're vaccinated, boosted, and healthy, you have dramatically lowered the chance that you will have severe disease, be hospitalized, or die, Poland says. But you have only moderately decreased the risk that you'll get infected with the Omicron variant. Given how transmissible the variant is, Poland recommends wearing a mask if you're gathering in an indoor setting with people not in your household.Plenty of people can become infected without ever knowing it and pass the virus onward, Karan adds. Masking can slow transmission between people who may be infectious but are without symptoms.Ultimately, people will need to consider their health conditions, risk tolerance, vaccination status, and COVID-19 levels in the community when making masking decisions, Weatherhead says. “In general, if everyone is fully vaccinated, asymptomatic and has a negative PCR test, the risk will be low and people do not universally need to wear a mask, particularly if gathering outdoors,” she says. People “who have underlying health conditions or are at high risk of progressing to severe disease if they become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may choose to continue to wear masks even around fully vaccinated groups.”Around the U.S., Omicron now accounts for more than 95 percent of new cases, according to data released this week by the CDC which uses a national surveillance system to get a sampling of circulating variants. But Delta is still around, and at-home tests won’t tell you which variant you have.For all the variants, “the best thing we can do is really identify what our risk tolerances [are] and to make sure that we're protecting others, especially during that highly contagious period of time,” Weatherhead says. “Outside of that, making sure you're vaccinated, wearing your mask, will provide that layered approach to reduce those risks of transmission.”",
"At the height of the COVID-19 tsunami that engulfed New York City in early 2020, a highly respected emergency room doctor, Lorna Breen, died by suicide. She had been serving as medical director at Manhattan’s NewYork Presbyterian Allen Hospital, and she was regarded as brilliant, energetic, and organized. She had no history of mental illness. But that changed after Breen contracted the virus.The 49-year-old doctor first showed symptoms on March 18. After a 10-day illness, she returned to work. Her family was alarmed: She was confused, hesitant, nearly catatonic, exhausted. Something was wrong. They brought her home to Charlottesville, and Breen checked into a psychiatric ward at University of Virginia Medical Center. Soon after she was released on April 26, she took her own life.“She had COVID, and I believe that it altered her brain,” her sister Jennifer Feist said on NBC’s Today show.At the time, doctors were just learning that this new coronavirus doesn’t target only the lungs and heart. It also impacts other organs, including the brain. “People arrived at the hospital with severe depression, hallucinations, or paranoia—and then we diagnosed them with COVID,” says Maura Boldrini, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Manhattan’s Columbia University Irving Medical Center.Now, almost two years into the pandemic, it’s become clear that neurological problems from COVID-19 can linger or intensify. After recovering from the virus, an alarming number of patients remain shrouded in brain fog, suffering from anxiety or depression, unable to think straight or hold on to memories, and fumbling for words. Not all had been hospitalized; some had only mild infections.Today these neurological problems are an established element of a larger syndrome known as long COVID that includes at least 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems.Boldrini notes that some long COVID symptoms mirror those caused by various chronic brain- and personality-altering conditions, including other viral infections, traumatic brain injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s. These conditions can radically change how people experience, interpret, and understand the world; destabilize emotions; and influence how people think about themselves or interact with others.While little is known about the mechanisms behind many of these symptoms, researchers increasingly believe that inflammation may play a key role. With COVID-19, a storm of inflammatory cytokine proteins can trigger an out-of-control immune response that might permanently damage or destroy brain cells.And with damage to the brain, Boldrini says, “we may not be the same person anymore.”Human personality is the set of deeply ingrained characteristics and habits that influence how people think, feel, and behave. It’s created by a complex interaction of nature and nurture: Inherited traits encoded in our DNA are influenced by our social environment and modified during early developmental experiences.“The brain is obviously so important in defining who we are. It's our ego; it’s everything about our identity,” says Ann McKee, who studies repetitive head trauma as a neurologist, neuropathologist, and head of Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center. “It’s a highly specialized organ, with each part doing fantastically specific things.”While basic personality tends to remain constant throughout adult life, conditions that disrupt brain function can induce extreme shifts in personality—and evidence is mounting that this happens for some people who contract COVID-19.Some patients have developed impulsive or irrational behavior, like Ivan Agerton. The 50-year-old former Marine and documentary photographer experienced psychosis in early 2021 after he recovered from a COVID-19 infection. He grew paranoid, terrified that people were following him and convinced that a SWAT officer was encamped outside his Seattle home. He was ultimately hospitalized in a psychiatric ward, twice.For some patients, this so-called COVID psychosis resolves with time. By June, Agerton said he’d fully recovered. But no one knows how long such COVID-induced symptoms might persist. A study of 395 people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 found that 91 percent had cognitive issues, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, or struggled with routine activities six months after they returned home.Healthcare workers and researchers are on the hunt for ways to treat these long-lasting symptoms, and that starts with figuring out why they happen in the first place.In 1906 psychiatrist and neuroanatomist Alois Alzheimer detailed the results of a brain autopsy on a 55-year-old woman named Auguste D. In the years before her death, she’d progressively lost her connection to reality, becoming an aggressive insomniac beset by increasing paranoia and suspicions about her family. She’d also suffered profound loss of memory.Upon examination, Alzheimer observed that her brain had shrunk dramatically. It was riddled with sticky clumps of plaque, abnormal deposits that nearly 80 years later would become the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. These jumbles of beta-amyloid protein had accumulated between neurons in the brain. We now know that they block electrical signals from reaching other parts of the brain, muscles, and organs. Alzheimer also found tangles of another protein, tau, that also disrupted communication between neurons.As neurons stop functioning and die, the brain shrinks and a person’s behavior becomes more erratic. With fewer neurons in the brain’s learning and memory regions, these functions begin to suffer, Boldrini says. People with Alzheimer’s disease forget where they put things and become disoriented. They become easily upset, confused, angered, belligerent, or lash out at loved ones or caregivers, whom they may not recognize.Damage to the cerebral cortex then impacts language, reasoning, and social behavior; it ultimately spreads and destroys much of the brain. The dementia becomes debilitating, and the disease eventually proves fatal, says Antonio Terracciano, a professor in the department of geriatrics at Florida State University.Alois Alzheimer’s discovery was a milestone in neurological research, linking changes in behavior to changes in the brain. Since Alzheimer’s seminal observations, researchers have recognized that many diseases can spark shifts in personality or mood disorders.Huntington’s, an inherited disease that breaks down neurons in a brain region called the basal ganglia, can cause people to lose their inhibitions or become more impulsive. It’s part of the reason why suicide rates among people with Huntington’s are up to 10 times the national average.In Parkinson's disease, which is likely caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine break down or die. Without enough dopamine, the disease’s hallmark tremors appear, and movements become slow.Parkinson’s also lowers levels of a neurotransmitter called serotonin, which regulates mood, appetite, and sleep. These changes in brain chemistry can cause neurological symptoms that frequently manifest years before the tremors begin, says Jeff Bronstein, who directs the Movement Disorders Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles.Patients may grow anxious, struggle to concentrate or shift between tasks. About half of patients grow depressed, Bronstein says. He has also seen patients slump into apathy, pulling into themselves. As their speech suffers or they grow forgetful, they avoid conversations with family and friends, becoming more withdrawn as depression deepens.Uncharacteristic irritability or mood swings can also signal Lyme disease. This bacterial infection from a tick bite causes inflammation that can set off swelling of the brain or its lining, inducing short-term memory loss, difficulty focusing, and symptoms such as anxiety and depression.Many viruses are already known to wreak havoc in the brain. Boldrini recounted what happened in the early days of the HIV epidemic, before antiviral medications were available that blocked replication of the pathogen and reduced viral load.“We used to see people who had HIV-AIDS with paranoia, hallucinations, but also cognitive symptoms, memory problems, concentration problems,” Boldrini says. As the viral infection spread through the brain, the membranes of the brain and spinal column swelled, and this AIDS dementia complex worsened.Many of the changes in behavior seen in COVID long-haulers also mirror those from traumatic brain injuries incurred in a car crash, a concussion from a contact sport like football or rugby, or from wartime military service. Damage to the frontal lobes, which sit behind the forehead, can impair executive functioning: organizing, planning, and multitasking. Memory and self-awareness may slip, and patients may not be aware of what they’ve lost.Some head injury survivors lose emotional control, says Boston University’s McKee, including young, previously easy-going people. She’s seen cognitive changes in athletes as young as 17 who play contact sports, and playing football before the age of 12 increases the odds.One common theme among these conditions is a sustained inflammatory process. It’s been implicated in head injuries and in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, where it causes additional loss of brain cells and exacerbates the formation of plaques.When the immune system launches an attack against a virus or another invader, waves of inflammatory cells circulate through the bloodstream like foot soldiers. With COVID-19 and other conditions, those immune cells may permeate the normally protective blood-brain barrier. If inflammation gets out of hand, the process may kill neurons, Bronstein says.Kriegstein notes that “most of the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to be the result of indirect effects likely mediated through inflammation or immune responses.”Inflammation also seems to interfere with brain metabolism. Researchers suspect that the process interrupts the flow of serotonin and prompts the body to instead produce a cascade of substances that are toxic to neurons.Boldrini was among the first to examine the brains of humans and research animals who’d died of COVID-19 to see what was happening on a cellular level. Under a microscope, Boldrini and her team examined brain samples stained with brightly colored dyes to characterize different types of cells. They observed changes to the hippocampus, a brain region that is embedded deep in the temporal lobe and plays a major role in learning and memory. She and her team counted about a tenth as many new neurons as are normally present in the hippocampus.“The brain fog made a lot of sense to me when I saw that there is loss of these neurons from COVID,” Boldrini says. The team also found damage to the medulla, which controls respiration and movement. Boldrini notes that they will continue to examine other brain regions for possible damage.Other researchers using brain imaging data from the U.K. recently discovered evidence of tissue damage, a thinner cortex, and loss of gray matter in people who had tested positive for the virus. The authors noted that there was “significantly greater cognitive decline” in patients who had been hospitalized.In addition to causing inflammation, the virus may be able to directly infect brain cells. “We discovered evidence that certain cells within the brain are capable of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, where the virus can replicate and infect other cell types,” says Joseph G. Gleeson, a neurologist at the University of California, San Diego.Other researchers have found that key support cells in the brain called astrocytes were the main cell types vulnerable to infection, says Madeline Andrews, a postdoctoral neuroscience scholar at the University of California, San Francisco. These star-shaped cells, abundant in the brain and spinal cord, regulate how neurons communicate, ensure that the barrier between the brain and the rest of the body is intact, and more.“Infected astrocytes may function differently and might not be able to maintain their typical roles in healthy brain homeostasis,” says Andrews.The virus that causes COVID-19 may also reduce blood flow to neurons by constricting capillaries—tiny blood vessels—or by interfering with their function. This may explain why the virus induces strokes: by starving the brain of oxygen. “The brain is very delicate, and alterations to blood flow or cellular health can lead to permanent changes to brain function,” Gleeson says.Many questions remain, though, including how to prevent the virus from causing significant cognitive damage. The key, Boldrini says, is to not let the immune system fight too long or too aggressively.Various treatments are being used to prevent the immune system from overreacting. Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral treatment is approved for hospitalized patients; two new oral antivirals, Merck’s molnupiravir andPfizer's Paxlovid, have been shown to reduce hospitalizations and death in patients at risk of serious illness. These drugs prevent the virus from reproducing, which may prevent an overactive immune response.Other drugs are used specifically to modulate the response: corticosteroids, Interleukin-6 inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors.Understanding how COVID-19 affects the brain may have far broader implications. Boldrini has preserved a few dozen brains from patients who died of the virus. By comparing tissues from patients who had experienced neurological symptoms with those who hadn’t, she hopes to shed light on the role of inflammation in a wide swath of neurodegenerative diseases.“As devastating as this disease is,” she says, “maybe it will help us better understand how the brain works.”",
"Angelique Coetzee was puzzled. The South African doctor had been seeing COVID-19 patients who mostly had sore throats and fevers. But on November 18 Coetzee examined a 29-year-old man complaining of extreme fatigue and severe headaches—symptoms more in line with heat stroke than COVID-19. By the end of the day, Coetzee had treated seven or eight similar cases.“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association.Within a week, researchers determined that the patients were infected with a new SARS-CoV-2 variant, now known as Omicron, that has a large number of mutations and can spread more rapidly than previous variants. Omicron is now dominant in South Africa and many other countries, including the United States.Omicron’s rise has reignited discussion about how to ensure the entire world can get a jab. The World Health Organization has set a target of vaccinating 70 percent of the global population by mid-2022. But while wealthy countries like the U.S. have already immunized more than 60 percent of their populations, vaccination in low-income countries is lagging. In South Africa only 27 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, while in Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Sudan that number is less than 3 percent.The problem goes beyond supply constraints. Experts say low-income countries face massive infrastructure challenges to distribute doses quickly and widely. They argue that wealthy countries have more than just a moral obligation to help address vaccine equity, because when the virus is circulating anywhere, it has more opportunities to mutate and spread.Mutations are normal for a virus, whose only purpose is to infect cells and replicate inside of them. In a single person’s body, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might copy its own genome at least thousands of times. Coronaviruses have so-called proofreading enzymes to keep them from introducing mistakes into their genetic code, but errors are bound to slip through, and that’s when mutations occur.Most of these mutations are useless or even destructive to the virus, points out Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London. She says the chance that a mutation will give an advantage to the virus, such as making it more transmissible or able to evade immunity from vaccination, is as low as 1-in-100,000. But those odds increase the more a virus is allowed to replicate.The best way to keep new variants from arising is thus to deny the virus the opportunity to spread and replicate. That can be done by social distancing, wearing masks, and testing—but the best weapon is widespread vaccination.“As long as Africa is not vaccinated, you will never be able to sleep soundly,” Coetzee says.Vaccines have two main advantages: They save lives by preventing people from getting severely sick, and they help control viral replication. Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people tend to be mild, which means a sick person won’t exhale as much virus for as long as they would if they were unvaccinated. That gives the virus less time to replicate inside the body and fewer opportunities to multiply in the rest of the population.That’s where vaccine equity comes in. Allowing a virus as transmissible as SARS-CoV-2 to run through parts of the world where large swaths of people are unvaccinated creates a real problem, says Ingrid Katz, associate faculty director at the Harvard Global Health Institute. “The only way to get in front of it is to use everything in your arsenal, and that includes vaccinating the world,” she says.Although it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint the exact origins of a viral variant, we do know that in India, low levels of vaccination played a role in the catastrophic emergence and surge of the Delta variant earlier this year.In early 2021 the country had begun rolling out vaccines only to those at high risk of severe disease due to their age, comorbidities, or frequent exposure to the virus. The rest of the adult population wasn’t scheduled for shots until September 2021.“All this was based on premise that India was out of the danger zone,” says K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. Cases and deaths were low in mid-January, and experts were predicting that India had built up enough herd immunity to avoid another wave. Then, Reddy says, India saw a surge of travel, election rallies, and religious festivals.“It was as though India had turned its back on the virus, though the virus had not turned its back on us,” he says.The Delta variant was first identified in March, when less than one percent of the population of nearly 1.4 billion people was fully vaccinated. Sure enough, cases and hospitalizations surged—soon followed by a staggering loss of life. (How India’s second wave became the worst COVID-19 surge in the world.)Unfortunately, vaccine inequities began to build long before any COVID-19 vaccines were even approved. Wealthy countries pre-ordered hundreds of billions of doses in early deals with pharmaceutical companies—leaving low-income countries without access to the vaccines from the start.“You set up a system of inequity right from the get-go,” Katz says.The WHO partnered with international nonprofits to address those inequities through COVAX, an initiative to secure doses for low-income countries. But vaccines are still disproportionately going to wealthy countries as they administer booster doses.Some countries have stepped up their donations in the name of vaccine equity, but Reddy points out that these donations have not always been well thought out. In the last year, there have been several high-profile instances in which wealthy countries waited to share their vaccine stockpiles until they were close to expiring—causing hundreds of thousands of donated doses to go to waste. For instance, South Sudan had to destroy nearly 60,000 doses in April, and up to a million doses went to waste in Nigeria in November.“That’s not charity—that’s just dumping,” Reddy says.Still, Amavi argues that COVAX has made an extraordinary difference in addressing vaccine equity for COVID-19 compared to past vaccination campaigns. The human papillomavirus vaccine, for example, first became available in 2006—but many African countries have only had access to it in the last couple of years.“With COVAX we have seen that in less than one year, all COVID-19 vaccines have been made available everywhere,” Amavi says. “I think it is a great achievement to have bridged the gap between producing countries and African countries that were not receiving the vaccine in the beginning.”Once countries have secured enough doses, though, they must figure out how to distribute them. And although low-income countries might get discounts on the jabs, it costs them more than high-income countries to roll out the shots.“It’s a challenge in Africa,” Coetzee says. “It doesn’t matter how many donations you give us.”According to the Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity, low-income countries would have to increase their healthcare spending by an average of nearly 57 percent to vaccinate 70 percent of their populations. That’s because many low-income countries lack the infrastructure—from electrical grid capacity to a trained healthcare workforce—to rapidly administer doses to billions of people. Distributing the mRNA vaccines is particularly daunting since they require access to cooler trucks and ultra-cold storage at healthcare facilities that are under-resourced even in the best of times.By contrast, high-income countries only need to increase spending by less than an additional one percent to vaccinate their entire populations.In India, the arrival of the Delta variant prompted the country to step up immunizations. Reddy says that the country has used drones to help get doses into remote areas and has launched a door-to-door vaccination campaign. India’s health minister reports that 85 percent of its eligible population has now had a first doseand more than half is fully vaccinated. However, many low-income countries simply lack the capacity to mobilize thousands of healthcare workers to go door-to-door—if they have that many trained professionals at all.Yet another challenge is convincing people to take the vaccine. Amavi says much of the vaccine hesitancy across the world can be blamed on a COVID-19 infodemic—or the spread of misinformation and disinformation that has been sowed by the anti-vax movement.But Katz says people in low-income countries are also understandably skeptical. She points to early reports that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were safer and more efficacious than those available to low-income countries, such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.Although this imbalance was because of cold-chain issues, Katz says it created some understandable vaccine hesitancy in countries where people feel they have gotten stuck with the worse vaccines. To remedy this, she says, public health experts must do better to reassure the population that the vaccines they’re receiving are safe and effective.Solutions to vaccine inequities start at the country level. Katz says that wealthy countries can share more of their stockpiled vaccine doses or even forgo their place in line for upcoming shipments. The international community can also provide financial assistance for low-income countries to build up healthcare infrastructure—which would also help during the inevitable next pandemic.Public health experts have also called on Moderna and Pfizer to help low-income countries produce their own mRNA vaccines—which would dramatically reduce the burdens of acquiring, transporting, and distributing them. Katz says this would require the companies not just to release their intellectual property rights but also to share their technology and raw materials.She adds that although the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines stood out early on—proving to be more than 90 percent effective at preventing severe disease—there is promising new evidence for other vaccines.The one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, for example, was only 66.3 percent effective in its original clinical trials, but the company reported in the fall that a second dose raised the vaccine’s efficacy against moderate to severe disease caused by the original virus to 94 percent. Although the J&J shot may be less effective against newer variants, Katz argues that this data shows two doses of the jab are about as effective as the mRNA vaccines.Barclay, too, points to new data out of the United Kingdom showing that mixing vaccines can boost immunity. A study published in The Lancet found that people who initially received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had higher levels of immunity after receiving a booster of one of the six other vaccines that are available.“So all is not lost,” she says. If countries can make progress getting the first shots in arms, they can always come back and boost with the mRNA vaccines.Coetzee, meanwhile, advocates for developing vaccine tablets that can be administered more easily in low-income countries. Even if the mRNA vaccines could be made widely available in low-income countries, they would still need cooler trucks to transport it and enough trained medical personnel to mix the vaccine, dilute it, portion it out into a syringe, and administer doses.“Everything can potentially lead to an error,” she says. “To give a tablet, there’s not a lot that can go wrong. You just need to make sure that the patient swallows the tablet.”Ultimately, most experts agree that policymakers and voters everywhere need to understand that their safety is ephemeral until more of the world is vaccinated. Katz urges people to make donations, advocate within their communities, and petition their governments to do more to address vaccine equity.“When will we learn that we have to be in collaboration globally?” she says. “We cannot go on like this.”Coetzee agrees. She suggests that richer countries launch programs to allow their citizens to sponsor vaccines for people in low-income countries. Beyond that, she says, everyone who has access to shots can help simply by getting vaccinated, getting boosted if you’re eligible, masking up, and practicing social distancing and hand washing.“What are you doing as a responsible citizen?” she asks. “You also need to play a role.”",
"Experts warned that regions with low vaccination rates could allow the virus that causes COVID-19 to evolve more rapidly, possibly yielding a more transmissible or antibody-resistant variant that would escalate the pandemic. Now this prediction may have come true.Last week the World Health Organization named a new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron and classified it as a variant of concern, along with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The variant was discovered in South Africa, where just 23 percent of the population is vaccinated, due in part to most supplies going to North America and Europe. However, at this early stage there is still a lot scientists can’t say for sure about Omicron and its potential to worsen the COVID-19 pandemic. So far most breakthrough cases involving this variant seem to be mild, and it’s unclear how much the mutations will erode vaccine efficacy. It is also unknown whether Omicron will cause more severe illness than Delta.Preliminary evidence from South Africa suggests that Omicron might be more transmissible than previous variants: Positive cases in the Tshwane region of Gauteng Province—where Omicron was first detected on November 9—increased from less than one percent to more than 30 percent of collected samples in the past three weeks. Omicron now makes up 76 percent of all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in South Africa, making it the most prevalent variant in the country. It is replacing other variants faster than Delta replaced Beta.“[It is] a reminder we have this new variant as a result of failure to control infections,” says Ravi Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge who is one of the world’s leading researchers on COVID-19.Omicron shares many key mutations with previous variants of concern, but it has also accumulated a dozen novel mutations on its spike protein, the part of the virus that is essential for infecting human cells. The new variant has 32 mutations in this region overall, and scientists fear the large number might diminish the ability of existing antibodies to neutralize the variant, making current vaccines less effective.“It has mutations at virtually every site that current antibodies would bind to,” says Michael Worobey, who studies the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona. There are also mutations that could make Omicron infect cells faster and transmit from person to person more easily. “This one is worrying, and I’ve not said that since Delta,” says Gupta.“While we know there are many mutations, in the case of this [Omicron] variant, we don’t yet know what their overall effect is,” cautions Kei Sato, a virologist at the University of Tokyo. Only about 1,000 people have been diagnosed with Omicron, and scientists currently have very few samples and genetic sequences from South Africa, which makes it difficult for experts to draw firm conclusions about Omicron’s contagiousness and whether it causes more severe disease.On the bright side, antibodies taken from people who were first naturally infected and then vaccinated were still able to neutralize a synthetic Omicron-type virus in the laboratory. That suggests a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine may still provide robust protection against Omicron.Omicron “is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a press briefing on Monday morning. “The best protection against this new variant or any of the various out there, the ones we’ve been dealing with already, is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot.”For now, “we have every indication that the vaccines are still effective in preventing severe disease and or complications,” says Ian Sanne, an infectious diseases specialist at University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. “The data, however, is small and early.”When an individual encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the body’s immune cells produce antibodies that target the spike protein, the part the virus uses to attach to the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells and infect them. When antibodies bind to the spike, the virus is blocked from entering the cell. Because the spike is essential for infection, all currently authorized vaccines use it to train the body’s immune response.The 32 mutations that occur in Omicron’s spike gene can be organized into three groups, depending on how they alter the function of the spike protein, says Olivier Schwartz, a virologist and immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in France.Some mutations enhance the spike protein’s ability to bind to the human ACE2 receptor; some help the surface of the virus fuse with the cell and allow the virus to enter; others alter the appearance of the spike protein, making it harder to recognize and allowing the virus to evade antibodies.Of the many mutations on Omicron’s spike, the loss of amino acids at positions 69 and 70 makes the virus twice as infectious as the original virus. But in a stroke of luck, these two mutations are not present in Delta, making Omicron easy to distinguish in a widely used PCR assay.The University of Cambridge’s Gupta has previously shown that these deleted amino acids, along with a third mutation at position 796 on the spike protein, are associated with Alpha’s ability to evade the body’s immune response. This suggests these same three mutations could help Omicron escape existing immunity either from vaccines or previous infections—and some preliminary evidence suggests that is happening.“To date there have been a number of breakthrough infections, but they have been mild,” says Barry Schoub, a virologist and adviser on COVID-19 vaccines to South Africa's government. However, experts say it is too early to know whether Omicron causes more severe disease as there is a lag between infection and hospitalization.Another cluster of mutations in Omicron at positions 655, 679 and 681 of the spike protein are thought to help the virus infect human cells more easily; they also exist in the Mu variant and are known to enhance its transmissibility.Additionally, in a study not yet peer reviewed, researchers suggest that a mutation that Omicron shares with Alpha and Mu might help it replicate faster and resist immunity. And a mutation at the 501 position also found in Alpha, Beta, and Gamma makes the spike protein attach more tightly to the ACE2 receptor, making the virus more efficient at infecting cells.“We see this virus spreading pretty rapidly in a population with, we think, very high levels of immunity,“ says Richard Lessells, infectious diseases specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. “That's what gives us concern,” he adds. “[Omicron] could have kind of more immune evasion than previous variants.”In the Gauteng region of South Africa, blood samples suggest 80 percent of the population already had some immunity because of encounters with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. That’s why experts are worried about the rapid rise of Omicron, which accounted for 76 percent of cases in just a couple of weeks. By comparison, it took Delta several months to reach that level of prevalence.The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in South Africa has also risen sharply within the last month, but whether that is due to overall numbers of people becoming infected or due to specific infection with Omicron is not yet clear.“There's not enough information available yet to make a conclusion about the severity of Omicron in comparison to other variants,” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. That’s because most early cases are among university students and younger people, who generally develop more mild disease.With current data, it’s also not clear whether the growth advantage of Omicron over Delta is because of its ability to escape immunity by reinfecting previously immune people, or by infecting individuals who haven’t been exposed to the virus, notes Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist and biostatistician at the KU Leuven University in Belgium.While the number of people testing positive in areas of South Africa affected by Omicron has risen sharply, there is not enough data to conclude whether that is entirely due to Omicron or to superspreader events among students and young people.Despite the worrying rise in cases, preliminary data, including studies from Theodora Hatziioannou’s lab in New York, suggest that vaccines and boosters are still powerful tools against the virus.Researchers led by Hatziioannou, of the Rockefeller University in New York, created a synthetic version of the virus that contained many of the spike protein mutations that Omicron carries. They found that neutralizing antibodies from people who had recovered from COVID-19 and then got an mRNA vaccine dose were able to fend off the mutated synthetic virus.However, it takes between two and three weeks after infection for COVID-19 to develop and the severity of the disease to be gauged, explains Sanne, which means it will take time to determine whether the existing vaccines hold up against Omicron in the real world.In the meantime, the best way to avoid any type of infection from Omicron or any other variant is to get more people vaccinated and for governments to continue promoting public health measures such as social distancing and mask wearing. “Please get vaccinated and boosted and mask up in public, as the mutations in this virus likely result in high-level escape from neutralizing antibodies,” says Gupta.“The primary way to minimize the emergence of new variants is to limit ongoing transmissions,” adds Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa. “Viruses can't mutate if they can't replicate.”",
"New DelhiDuring the past few weeks, Indian social media has been inundated with SOS messages: hospitals tweeting about dwindling oxygen supplies and physicians watching helplessly as patients perish from preventable deaths. A journalist pleading for but denied a hospital bed took to Twitter to log his deteriorating condition till he died. Overwhelmed crematoria are working round-the-clock to keep up with the pace of bodies; furnaces have melted down from overuse and additional funeral platforms are being built outside. Such are the heartbreaking messages and haunting images that highlight the formidable second wave of the coronavirus pandemic raging through the country.India broke the world record for the most new coronavirus cases this week, surpassing 330,000 new cases on Friday, as deaths in the past 24 hours jumped to a record 2,263, the health ministry said. The United States held the previous one-day record with 300,669 new cases recorded on January 8, 2021."We completely let down our guard and assumed in January that the pandemic was over—and COVID surveillance and control took a back seat,” says K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. But “there were still a fairly large proportion of people in the big cities, but also in smaller cities and villages, who were not exposed to the virus last year, who were susceptible.”As cases declined from September 2020 to mid-February 2021, the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ignored warnings of a second wave, despite the fact that new variants were identified as far back as in January, according to media reports.“We kept warning that the pandemic was not over but no one was listening,” says Rakesh Mishra, senior principal scientist and director of the Hyderabad-based Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, who is currently investigating whether a new homegrown variant—B.1.617—is behind India’s second surge.After the first wave, Mishra says, the healthcare system moved on to tackle other medical emergencies that were neglected during the first wave, and dedicated COVID-19 facilities were converted back to their previous functions.In March, a few weeks before the new surge, Indian health minister and physician Harsh Vardhan asserted that India was in the “endgame” of the COVID-19 pandemic, justifying his government’s decision to export medical resources to other countries. India had increased its oxygen exports to other countries by a whopping 734 percent in January 2021. It also exported around 193 million doses of vaccines. But the picture changed drastically when India began recording a dramatic increase in new cases from April 15 onward, with more than 200,000 cases daily; now hospitals are running out of oxygen. On April 23, the Indian media reported that 25 critically ill COVID patients died due to oxygen shortages in a government hospital in Delhi.“The surge took us by surprise and the system is now totally overwhelmed,” says Mishra. Indians are being turned away from vaccination centers because supplies have run out.Early on the morning of April 22 at Kailash Hospital in Noida’s sector 71, a quiet, tree-lined residential area, at least ten people affected by the SARS-COV 2 virus were waiting for high-resolution compounded tomography—a sophisticated lung scan that is used to determine inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Their ages varied from mid-thirties to late sixties, and all were waiting to discover possible damage from the coronavirus. By 1 p.m., the numbers had swelled to over 50 people.This leafy suburb of the Indian capital that lies in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh has a population of around 637,000—most of whom live in skyscrapers that dot the city skyline—and over 3,700 active cases. On April 18, it recorded 700 new cases, the highest one-day case spike in the state since the pandemic began last year.In what is a stark contrast to last year, apartment authorities are delivering daily case updates within the building complexes. Chat groups are filled with pleas for food delivery, home sanitation, and requests for medicines and other COVID-related supplies, as hospitals continue to turn away seriously ill patients and pharmacies struggle to supply basic medicines such as paracetamols or Fabipiravir, an anti-viral tablet approved for treating mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.“We are turning away 10-15 patients every day,” says Monu (who goes by just his first name), one of the Kailash Hospital’s attendants. “There are no beds.”On April 22, the Delhi High Court had convened for a special hearing at 8 pm —responding to an urgent plea filed by one of Delhi’s top hospitals, Max Patparganj. The hospital had informed the court that it had only three hours of oxygen left—placing the lives of 400 of its patients, including 262 who were COVID positive, under duress.This second wave in India has been widely attributed to the B.1.1.7 variant—first identified in the U.K.—which had ramped up cases in the state of Punjab. Another possible culprit is a homegrown variant, called B.1.617, with two worrying mutations, that originated in Maharashtra, the worst affected state.This variant, B.1.617, is also believed to be triggering new surges in Bangladesh and Pakistan and led many countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., to advise citizens against traveling to the region.The University of Washington’s IHME says seroprevalence surveys, which measure the percentage of people in a population who have antibodies against the SARS-CoV 2 virus, and their own modeling strongly suggests that the new surge is linked to “escape variants”— which can override immunity afforded by previous infection. Vaccines, too, are less effective against these variants. However, experiments completed at Mishra’s institute on April 22 found that the B.1.617 was not resistant to the protection offered by Covishield (also known as the AstraZeneca vaccine), one of the vaccines in India's inoculation program.“A bigger second wave is a global, historical trend of this infection,” says epidemiologist Rajib Dasgupta, chairperson of the Centre of Social Medicine & Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Once a new variant is identified, he adds, its epidemiology must be investigated and key resources moved to affected areas to strengthen capabilities.In India the surge is specific to particular districts within a state. This is “unlike in the U.K., for example, where the U.K. variant was found to be responsible for 70-80 percent of the cases,” Dasgupta says. “India is so large and heterogenous that multiple variants can be anticipated to emerge, and will need to be identified and tracked.”Wherever a new variant emerges, he says, it will most likely lead to a faster spread, particularly if it is an escape variant. Identifying those variants and customizing the response can help contain surges more effectively, he adds. “One epidemic is actually multiple epidemics in a country like India, and you need to have multiple strategies to address them,” says Dasgupta.Mishra’s institute also found that the double mutant is only responsible for around 10 percent of the cases countrywide. In Maharashtra, where this variant was dominant, it accounted for only 30 percent of the cases. “I would blame this surge on human behavior,” says Mishra.Second surges have typically been blamed on human behavior worldwide. During the second wave in the U.S. that lasted 45 days, Lisa Maragakis, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, wrote in an article that noted “after many months of canceled activities, economic challenges and stress, people are frustrated and tired of taking coronavirus precautions” and these factors were “driving surges and spikes in COVID-19 cases.”In India, too, a year of COVID-fatigue gave way to an ill-advised euphoria over herd immunity as cases began to dip in January. But as Reddy says “in this very mobile age, unless the whole world acquires substantial immunity, [herd immunity] cannot [happen].”But warnings such as these, Reddy says, were shouted down by the people as “negative sentiments.” Mishra was accused by many of his acquaintances of creating false alarm over a second wave. On April 1, the Kumbh Mela, an annual religious event, was also allowed to begin with full fanfare. As 3.5 million Indian devotees gathered in the state of Uttarakhand to take an annual holy dip in the Ganges, it was unsurprising that it turned into a superspreader event—although its full effect won’t be known for a few weeks. In the short term it pushed up the number of daily cases in Uttarakhand from 30 to 60 cases in February to 2,000-2,500 this month.Cinemas, schools, malls, bars, and restaurants were allowed to open in October last year, guest restrictions in wedding ceremonies were relaxed, and politicians freely crisscrossed the country for election rallies as four Indian states went to the polls for regional elections.In West Bengal, a state currently electing a new government, voting extends from March 27 till April 29 with the state continuing to host extensive rallies and crowded electioneering even as daily cases surge. On April 1, the state had recorded 6,519 cases. In the last 24 hours it recorded 12,000 new cases—and the count is expected to go up to 20,000 by the end of the week.A separate, more infectious variant, named the Bengal strain—a triple mutant—has also been identified as the cause of many of the infections in the state. Prime Minister Modi called off election rallies in West Bengal on April 23 in light of the surge.Could the second wave have been prevented? Experts say no. But it could have been substantially contained. “Typically in all countries the second wave is always much bigger than the first wave, and the reason is that in the second wave a lot of younger adults are affected,” says Dasgupta.A briefing by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), an independent global health research center at the University of Washington, says India’s daily COVID-19 cases are now double the number in the previous peak in September 2020. The institute predicts the COVID-19 death toll in India will likely double to 665,000 by August 1, 2021.“Without drastic measures to decrease social mixing and increase effective face mask use, the situation currently looks quite grim in India,” the briefing said.The IHME predicts daily deaths will peak at 5,600, on May 10. The institute says that if India is able to achieve universal mask coverage in the next week, it could prevent 70,000 deaths.Come May 1, every Indian above the age of 18 will be eligible for vaccination. If that happens on schedule, the IHME predicts another 85,600 lives could be saved by August 1.The coming three to four weeks, Reddy says, will be crucial to contain the surge: “It’s a race against time.”",
"With the holidays here and the threat from the Omicron variant growing larger, Americans now face a familiar dilemma: Should you go forward with your family gatherings or skip them, possibly for the second year in a row?Even fully vaccinated Americans who believed the shots were the ticket to getting back to normal have been watching anxiously as the more transmissible Omicron has jumped from causing 12.6 percent to 73.2 percent of COVID-19 cases in just a week. Public health officials caution that breakthrough infections will account for some of those new cases—even though the vaccines still largely protect against severe disease and death.But there’s a useful tool to help decide whether to gather over the holidays: testing. Rachael Piltch-Loeb, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says that tests offer sorely needed insight even when there’s still much unknown about Omicron—including how likely it is for fully vaccinated people to get infected.Barun Mathema, assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, agrees. “Testing is the only way to really know what risk you pose to yourself and to your community,” he says. “Without it, essentially, you’re blind.”Tests are in short supply right now, but the Biden administration has announced a plan to deliver a half billion free rapid tests to Americans who want them. Unfortunately, those tests won’t be available until January. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about testing in the age of the Omicron variant—and what experts say you should do if you test positive.Every viral disease has an incubation period—the time from when you were exposed to a pathogen to when it can be detected. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends waiting five to seven days after exposure to COVID-19 before taking a test. Although that’s still the rule of thumb, Piltch-Loeb says it may change with the Omicron variant.Some early data suggests that it takes only around two to three days for people to start showing symptoms after exposure to the Omicron variant. Likewise, Piltch-Loeb says that tests seem to be picking up the virus within about two days of exposure as well. Although that’s a bad sign for the transmissibility of the virus, the silver lining is that it may not take five days to get a positive result—allowing you to cancel future plans even sooner if necessary.Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests are considered the gold standard for detecting COVID-19. These tests—which look for the presence of genetic material from the virus—are highly sensitive and are unlikely to lead to false negatives.Rapid antigen tests, meanwhile, are less reliable. They detect pieces of proteins from the virus and work best when you have a higher viral load, which is why they’re often used when people are symptomatic. Some brands of tests are more reliable than others, too: Piltch-Loeb suggests checking the CDC website, which lists the SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests that have been authorized for emergency use in the U.S.But given how quickly Omicron can spread, Piltch-Loeb says the more reliable PCR tests don’t always make sense. While it typically takes two to three days to get the lab results back, the recent surge in testing has overwhelmed laboratories, meaning that it is taking even longer for results to be returned. So if you don’t get your result back in time for a planned gathering, Piltch-Loeb says, the PCR may not help make a time-sensitive decision.It’s also unclear how people who are fully vaccinated and boosted should interpret a PCR test. The CDC acknowledges that fully vaccinated people are infectious for less time than unvaccinated people.That’s where the rapid antigen tests come in. Within 15 to 30 minutes, rapid tests provide a snapshot of whether you have a high load of virus at that time. So if you’re fully vaccinated, a positive rapid test may ultimately be a better indicator than a positive PCR test for whether you are shedding virus and pose a threat to grandma tonight.Meanwhile, a negative rapid test likely means you are not infectious at that point in time—although the virus may still be incubating inside you. But experts caution that this isn’t a certainty given the potential for false negatives. Studies have shown that rapid tests are able to catch up to 85 percent of COVID-19 cases—meaning there’s plenty of room for error.Ultimately, however, choosing a test comes down to your risk tolerance, Mathema says. He agrees that positive rapid tests are reliable, particularly when you are symptomatic, since false positives are far less likely than false negatives. However, he adds, “The part that I worry about is when you get a negative. What does the negative mean? What level of comfort does that give you?” If you want to be conscientious, he recommends getting the PCR test instead of, or in addition to, a rapid test.If you have symptoms but test negative for COVID-19, you should keep testing. The CDC recommends taking two or more follow-up rapid tests, waiting at least 24 hours between each one. If you continue to test negative, Piltch-Loeb says, it’s likely you have a different kind of respiratory infection. But that’s not a guarantee. And since spreading the cold or the flu is generally frowned upon, she suggests isolating and masking until you’re symptom-free.If you don’t have symptoms and test negative, however, Piltch-Loeb says to keep in mind that timing is critical for rapid tests. Since Omicron is so transmissible—and these tests provide only a snapshot in time—you could test negative in the morning and positive by the afternoon. To lower your chances of spreading the virus at Christmas dinner, you should take a rapid test an hour beforehand.For true peace of mind, however, Mathema suggests following up a negative rapid test with a PCR test before gathering with friends and family—no matter your vaccination status.The CDC advises anyone with a positive test to stay home or isolate for 10 days and wear a mask if you’re around others. You should also notify anyone that you’ve had close contact with in the last two days and alert your doctor. People who are unvaccinated should adhere to this rule since they are more likely to become infected and spread the virus.If you are vaccinated and don’t have any symptoms, however, Piltch-Loeb suggests following up with a second rapid test later that day or the next. If both are positive you likely pose an infectious risk. If the second test is negative, then your results are inconclusive, and you should get a PCR test to be certain.If your PCR results don’t come back in time, Piltch-Loeb says you should stay home and isolate if you don’t want any risk. Otherwise, she recommends having a conversation with your family and friends about their risk factors and decide together whether to keep your plans. If you’re asymptomatic and getting an inconsistent result, the likelihood you pose a serious threat is low—but the overall risk is higher if your loved ones are unvaccinated or vulnerable to severe disease.“This is not perfect science,” Piltch-Loeb says. “There’s not a great answer. You’re left with some uncertainty as to what your status is.”The bad news is that there’s only so much that getting your first shot—or even a booster dose—can do for you immediately. It takes time for the vaccine to train your immune system to protect against the virus. Studies show that two doses provide much greater protection than one—and it takes more than a month to complete a two-dose regimen of any of the vaccines.Meanwhile, it’s not clear how effective the two-dose regimen will be against Omicron for the newly vaccinated. But new evidence suggests that the immunity generated by two doses wanes over time. That makes a booster dose particularly critical for those who received the full dose of an mRNA vaccine more than six months ago, or the J&J shot more than two months ago, in protecting against Omicron. But the effects of the booster, too, still take about two weeks to fully kick in.Still, experts point out that some protection against the virus is still better than none. Even if you’re not protected in time for holiday gatherings, Mathema argues that you’re going to want that protection in the weeks ahead as Omicron continues to surge across the country.“If there’s any moment to get vaccinated, this is the moment,” he says. “Because one thing this pathogen will do is it will find the unvaccinated.”",
"As the new Omicron variant spreads, experts say the best defense against all viral variants that cause COVID-19 is a full dose of a vaccine followed by a booster shot several months later.Since the first mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 was authorized on December 11, 2020, studies have shown that unvaccinated people are at five times greater risk of getting infected and 10 times greater risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 than those who are fully vaccinated.But research from Israel and the U.S. also revealed that vaccine-induced immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus wanes in six to eight months. That’s especially worrying as more populations are exposed to the more contagious Omicron variant, which was first detected in November in South Africa.To date Omicron has been reported in 77 countries. In the United States, the variant is in more than 37 states and makes up 3 percent of total cases; the rest are still Delta. But in London it now makes up the majority of positively diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and in South Africa it is the dominant strain.Boosters, however, can restore antibody levels to their peak values—providing more robust protection against Omicron.“Vaccines help to protect you, or at least prevent you from dying from the disease,” says Leo Poon, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong who detected some of the first cases of Omicron outside of South Africa. “And no matter what it is, Omicron or Delta, having a booster will be beneficial.”COVID-19 vaccines train our immune systems to make antibodies using synthetic versions of the virus’s spike protein—the part of the virus that helps it bind to human cells. If a vaccinated person later encounters the virus, the antibodies recognize it and bind to the spike protein to prevent infection.The first dose of an mRNA vaccine prepares the cells to make antibodies, and the second dose matures and enhances those antibodies to bind even more strongly to the spike protein, so that it can’t anchor to receptors on human cells. In the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a single dose was enough to make sufficient antibodies against the original coronavirus.But for all COVID-19 vaccines authorized to date, antibody levels do gradually decline, says Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccinologist at Texas Children’s Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine. That’s where boosters come in.The booster dose is currently recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for everyone ages 18 and older. The CDC says people should get boosted six months after their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines, or two months after the J&J vaccine. The CDC has also recommended boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds who were fully vaccinated with two jabs of the Pfizer vaccine.Scientists are still gathering evidence for how long immunity from the booster lasts and whether more will be needed down the line.Since Omicron has accumulated over 30 mutations in the spike protein alone compared to the original virus, it seems to evade antibodies generated by two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or the single dose of the J&J vaccine, especially as antibody levels drop in the blood.In a U.K. study that’s not yet been peer reviewed, the effectiveness of two shots of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines in preventing COVID-19 symptoms from Omicron fell to less than 40 percent within 15 weeks after the second dose. There was a lesser decline in the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against Delta, but vaccine effectiveness still slipped to just 60 percent after 25 weeks.Other preliminary studies from South Africa, Israel, and France also show steep declines in the ability of antibodies to neutralize Omicron in people vaccinated with the two-dose Pfizer vaccine or two doses of Moderna’s vaccine.The good news is that a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine increases antibody levels by 25-fold, which should be sufficient to neutralize Omicron. A booster dose of Moderna’s vaccine also improved the neutralization of Omicron compared to the previous two shots alone.“The two doses with waning immunity mean there's no protection within a few months after the two doses,” says Peter Hotez, a pediatrician and vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine. “The booster at least gives you something in the 70 percent range.”Other studies show that when people received any mRNA booster dose, their antibody levels against Omicron rose to the protective level considered sufficient to prevent a COVID-19 infection.“Our booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron,” Anthony Fauci said during a White House COVID-19 update on 15 December. “At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster,” Fauci added.However, the data so far is largely from laboratory studies, and immunity involves more than just antibodies. More real-world data will be important to assess how effective current vaccines will be against Omicron in the long run.",
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded eligibility for booster doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents ages 12 to 15. The agency also announced that all people can now get a booster dose five months after they were fully vaccinated rather than the six month interval that was originally authorized.Additionally, the FDA authorized a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 with certain conditions that compromise their immune systems, including those who have undergone solid organ transplants.The FDA has determined that these steps are necessary to help combat the spread of the Omicron variant, which has driven a surge in cases that has already surpassed last year’s winter peak. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement that the data show that an additional dose may provide better protection against the Omicron and Delta variants.The FDA also said that real-world data from Israel’s vaccination campaign shows no new safety concerns for a booster dose in the younger teenage population, with no new cases of myocarditis or pericarditis reported to date.In a press conference following the announcement, Marks also urged everyone who has not been vaccinated yet to do so, emphasizing that even a single dose can help prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19. “It’s not too late to start to get vaccinated,” he said.Stay up to date and read more on the latest COVID-19 developments here.● Can COVID-19 alter your personality?● Variants will keep coming until everyone can access vaccines● 5 things to know about COVID-19 tests in the age of Omicron● Will Omicron ruin your holiday travels?● How booster shots can help protect you from Omicron",
"Is it safe to travel now? It depends. The Omicron variant of COVID-19, which has contributed to a “tidal wave” of infections in the United Kingdom, is rattling Europe and fueling dread about the holidays. Countries have responded by returning to 2020-like restrictions with the Netherlands in lockdown until January 14 and France banning tourists from the U.K. for now.That tidal wave appears to be headed to the United States. In the U.S., COVID-19 cases are rising rapidly in places like New York State, which broke a record for new cases reported in one day (22,000) on Saturday.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky says she expects Omicron to become the dominant variant in the coming weeks, setting the stage for a new wave of infections.This has prompted White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients to warn that the unvaccinated are “looking at a winter of severe illness and death—for yourselves, your families and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.” President Joe Biden will address the country December 21 to talk about Omicron and its challenges. This comes when only 61.4 percent of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.Although many pandemic restrictions and precautions are still in place, the anticipated Omicron surge is a serious cause for concern, especially as holiday travel is underway. This leaves many travelers—who have planned holiday reunions for months—with the question: Now what?One fact has emerged: You can’t eliminate the risk of catching the coronavirus while traveling, but you can minimize it. Here’s everything you need to know about traveling during the latest surge.Omicron was first detected in South Africa’s Gauteng Province, in late November. Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified Omicron as a variant of concern, along with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.Viruses are constantly changing, including the one that causes COVID-19. These changes occur over time and can lead to the emergence of variants that may have new characteristics.Ongoing analysis shows Omicron is the most contagious variant to date. It shares many key mutations with previous variants of concern, but it has accumulated a dozen novel mutations on its spike protein, the part of the virus that is essential for infecting human cells. Overall, Omicron has 32 mutations, some of which could infect cells faster and transmit more easily from person to person.(Here’s why you shouldn’t panic over the Omicron variant.)Positive cases in the region where Omicron was first detected increased from less than one percent to more than 30 percent in three weeks. Despite mounting concerns, White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci says that he doesn't “foresee” a lockdown in the U.S.The CDC says that vaccines continue to reduce a person’s risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 and are highly effective against severe illness. Although research is still being done, some early studies suggest booster shots are at least 80 percent effective at preventing severe illness caused by Omicron. Moderna announced Monday that preliminary data shows their half-dose booster shot increases antibodies against Omicron. Still, only one in six eligible Americans have received a booster, worrying health officials.As the CDC outlines, COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, nose, or mouth. In some circumstances, droplets may contaminate surfaces. People who are closer than six feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.While there is no current need for Omicron-specific boosters, early data indicates that a booster dose of either Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can restore antibody levels to their peak values, providing enhanced protection against Omicron.Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required in indoor areas of public transportation (including airplanes) and indoors in U.S. transportation hubs (including airports).The CDC recommends that you check your destination’s COVID-19 situation before traveling. The CDC actively updates warnings against international travel and cautions about travel within the U.S. Best advice is to delay travel until you are fully vaccinated.(Discover how booster shots can help protect you from Omicron.)If you are not fully vaccinated and must travel, get tested both before and after your trip. If you’re concerned about your own potential exposure but can’t test and quarantine before a holiday trip, hold joint festivities outdoors, keep six feet apart, and stay masked at all times.Related health and safety measures, outlined by the World Health Organization include: washing your hands well, avoiding touching your face, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, disinfecting frequently touched items like your phone, and staying home if you’re sick.The CDC recommends that you should not travel if you have been exposed to COVID-19 (unless you are fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days); you are sick; you tested positive for COVID-19 and haven’t ended isolation (even if you are fully vaccinated); you are waiting for results of a COVID-19 test.If your test comes back positive while you are at your destination, you will need to isolate and postpone your return until it’s safe, generally until you have taken several consecutive negative PCR tests. Your travel companions may need to self-quarantine. Consider whether the benefits of travel outweigh the risk that you might spread the virus.Travel insurance and even credit cards can protect you if you must cancel or change your trip. By far the most flexible option is a Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) policy. It can help recoup as much as 75 percent of your trip’s cost, but it can be pricey. Standard coverage can cost about 5 percent of your trip cost, but CFAR can push that up to 50 percent.Experts recommend doing your homework and contacting an agent with specific questions long before you pack your bags. Sites like Travelinsurance.com, Squaremouth.com, and Insuremytrip.com are handy tools for comparing policies from multiple providers.Whichever policy you consider, Long Island travel agent Helen Prochilo notes that “fear is not covered.”(Here’s how travel insurance can—and can’t help—when plans change.)Wearing masks when traveling on planes, trains, and other forms of transit continues to be one of the cheapest, easiest, and most effective ways to zap your risk of catching COVID-19. The CDC recommends wearing them inside in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases and anytime you will be in close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.The U.S. government extended the mask mandate on airplanes and trains until March 18, 2022. For details on wearing masks, check out the CDC’s extensive guide. Although cloth masks were widely used early in the pandemic due to a PPE shortage, there is now an ample supply of surgical, N95, and KN95 masks. These block at least 95 percent of 0.1-micron particles and are more effective at preventing disease than cloth masks.Masking customs and local laws differ from state to state and country to country. The best way to assure protection in an indoor, congregate setting is to cover your face. If people around you on an airplane or crowded place aren’t masking, you could politely ask anyone who gets too close “would you mind giving us a bit more space, please?” but it might be easier just to move away. It’s likely not worth the risk, or the stress, to confront a stranger. If you can’t escape the situation, ask a store manager or flight attendant for help.If you’re symptom-free and following stringent health rules at home, you generally don’t need to test before leaving for domestic travel. But travel to some international destinations requires a recent negative test in addition to proof of vaccination; several European countries including France and Switzerland require a recent negative COVID-19 test for entrance, usually within 24 hours.There are several types of COVID-19 tests, with molecular ones like RT-PCR tests seen as most reliable. At-home, rapid tests—which U.S. President Joe Biden says insurance will pay for soon—can provide some assurance that you aren’t actively infectious. “If you can afford it and you can find them, get rapid at-home tests. My wife refers to them as day passes,” said COVID-19 expert and former White House advisor Andy Slavitt on a recent In The Bubble podcast. ”Take it, and that day, you’re pretty clear you’re not infectious. If you’re coming over, spring for a box.”Still, you could have a negative result and still be infected with—and pass along—COVID-19. After exposure, the average person takes about five days to develop measurable levels of the virus, known as the “incubation window.” This window doesn’t always match the symptoms, which can take up to 14 days to appear. In the meantime, people could pass the virus to anyone they come into close contact with. Some 50 percent of COVID-19 transmission comes from those without symptoms.Road trips have soared in popularity during the pandemic, and driving to your holiday destination—while avoiding contact with others—does mean less indoor time with strangers than flying. But many experts say airplanes are safer than you think. High-tech filtration and low-tech masks make flying safer. The air you breathe in flight—though not necessarily entirely virus-free—is much cleaner than the air in restaurants, bars, stores, and most homes.Remember that COVID-19 most often spreads when people come in close contact, increasing their exposure to hefty respiratory droplets or smaller particles called aerosols that linger in the air over a few feet. Airplane ventilation systems filter out 99 percent of those particles.(Which plane seat is safest? How to choose the least germy spot.)The bigger danger is the airport, which presents the highest risk of catching the coronavirus during air travel. The labyrinth of human bodies means you’ll want to practice social distancing, mask wearing, and good hygiene (bring hand sanitizer!) in check-in and boarding lines. If you’re hungry, eat far away from other people. On the flight, open your overhead vent. The gust coming out is not only filtered, it also creates an invisible buffer between you and others. Snacking or drinking en route should be OK as long as you don’t take your mask off for longer than 15 minutes.With reporting by Nsikan Akpan, Vicky Hallett, Sanjay Mishra, Johanna Read, and Allie Yang.",
"Experts warned that regions with low vaccination rates could allow the virus that causes COVID-19 to evolve more rapidly, possibly yielding a more transmissible or antibody-resistant variant that would escalate the pandemic. Now this prediction may have come true.Last week the World Health Organization named a new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron and classified it as a variant of concern, along with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. The variant was discovered in South Africa, where just 23 percent of the population is vaccinated, due in part to most supplies going to North America and Europe. However, at this early stage there is still a lot scientists can’t say for sure about Omicron and its potential to worsen the COVID-19 pandemic. So far most breakthrough cases involving this variant seem to be mild, and it’s unclear how much the mutations will erode vaccine efficacy. It is also unknown whether Omicron will cause more severe illness than Delta.Preliminary evidence from South Africa suggests that Omicron might be more transmissible than previous variants: Positive cases in the Tshwane region of Gauteng Province—where Omicron was first detected on November 9—increased from less than one percent to more than 30 percent of collected samples in the past three weeks. Omicron now makes up 76 percent of all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in South Africa, making it the most prevalent variant in the country. It is replacing other variants faster than Delta replaced Beta.“[It is] a reminder we have this new variant as a result of failure to control infections,” says Ravi Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge who is one of the world’s leading researchers on COVID-19.Omicron shares many key mutations with previous variants of concern, but it has also accumulated a dozen novel mutations on its spike protein, the part of the virus that is essential for infecting human cells. The new variant has 32 mutations in this region overall, and scientists fear the large number might diminish the ability of existing antibodies to neutralize the variant, making current vaccines less effective.“It has mutations at virtually every site that current antibodies would bind to,” says Michael Worobey, who studies the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona. There are also mutations that could make Omicron infect cells faster and transmit from person to person more easily. “This one is worrying, and I’ve not said that since Delta,” says Gupta.“While we know there are many mutations, in the case of this [Omicron] variant, we don’t yet know what their overall effect is,” cautions Kei Sato, a virologist at the University of Tokyo. Only about 1,000 people have been diagnosed with Omicron, and scientists currently have very few samples and genetic sequences from South Africa, which makes it difficult for experts to draw firm conclusions about Omicron’s contagiousness and whether it causes more severe disease.On the bright side, antibodies taken from people who were first naturally infected and then vaccinated were still able to neutralize a synthetic Omicron-type virus in the laboratory. That suggests a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine may still provide robust protection against Omicron.Omicron “is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a press briefing on Monday morning. “The best protection against this new variant or any of the various out there, the ones we’ve been dealing with already, is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot.”For now, “we have every indication that the vaccines are still effective in preventing severe disease and or complications,” says Ian Sanne, an infectious diseases specialist at University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. “The data, however, is small and early.”When an individual encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the body’s immune cells produce antibodies that target the spike protein, the part the virus uses to attach to the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells and infect them. When antibodies bind to the spike, the virus is blocked from entering the cell. Because the spike is essential for infection, all currently authorized vaccines use it to train the body’s immune response.The 32 mutations that occur in Omicron’s spike gene can be organized into three groups, depending on how they alter the function of the spike protein, says Olivier Schwartz, a virologist and immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in France.Some mutations enhance the spike protein’s ability to bind to the human ACE2 receptor; some help the surface of the virus fuse with the cell and allow the virus to enter; others alter the appearance of the spike protein, making it harder to recognize and allowing the virus to evade antibodies.Of the many mutations on Omicron’s spike, the loss of amino acids at positions 69 and 70 makes the virus twice as infectious as the original virus. But in a stroke of luck, these two mutations are not present in Delta, making Omicron easy to distinguish in a widely used PCR assay.The University of Cambridge’s Gupta has previously shown that these deleted amino acids, along with a third mutation at position 796 on the spike protein, are associated with Alpha’s ability to evade the body’s immune response. This suggests these same three mutations could help Omicron escape existing immunity either from vaccines or previous infections—and some preliminary evidence suggests that is happening.“To date there have been a number of breakthrough infections, but they have been mild,” says Barry Schoub, a virologist and adviser on COVID-19 vaccines to South Africa's government. However, experts say it is too early to know whether Omicron causes more severe disease as there is a lag between infection and hospitalization.Another cluster of mutations in Omicron at positions 655, 679 and 681 of the spike protein are thought to help the virus infect human cells more easily; they also exist in the Mu variant and are known to enhance its transmissibility.Additionally, in a study not yet peer reviewed, researchers suggest that a mutation that Omicron shares with Alpha and Mu might help it replicate faster and resist immunity. And a mutation at the 501 position also found in Alpha, Beta, and Gamma makes the spike protein attach more tightly to the ACE2 receptor, making the virus more efficient at infecting cells.“We see this virus spreading pretty rapidly in a population with, we think, very high levels of immunity,“ says Richard Lessells, infectious diseases specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. “That's what gives us concern,” he adds. “[Omicron] could have kind of more immune evasion than previous variants.”In the Gauteng region of South Africa, blood samples suggest 80 percent of the population already had some immunity because of encounters with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. That’s why experts are worried about the rapid rise of Omicron, which accounted for 76 percent of cases in just a couple of weeks. By comparison, it took Delta several months to reach that level of prevalence.The number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in South Africa has also risen sharply within the last month, but whether that is due to overall numbers of people becoming infected or due to specific infection with Omicron is not yet clear.“There's not enough information available yet to make a conclusion about the severity of Omicron in comparison to other variants,” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. That’s because most early cases are among university students and younger people, who generally develop more mild disease.With current data, it’s also not clear whether the growth advantage of Omicron over Delta is because of its ability to escape immunity by reinfecting previously immune people, or by infecting individuals who haven’t been exposed to the virus, notes Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist and biostatistician at the KU Leuven University in Belgium.While the number of people testing positive in areas of South Africa affected by Omicron has risen sharply, there is not enough data to conclude whether that is entirely due to Omicron or to superspreader events among students and young people.Despite the worrying rise in cases, preliminary data, including studies from Theodora Hatziioannou’s lab in New York, suggest that vaccines and boosters are still powerful tools against the virus.Researchers led by Hatziioannou, of the Rockefeller University in New York, created a synthetic version of the virus that contained many of the spike protein mutations that Omicron carries. They found that neutralizing antibodies from people who had recovered from COVID-19 and then got an mRNA vaccine dose were able to fend off the mutated synthetic virus.However, it takes between two and three weeks after infection for COVID-19 to develop and the severity of the disease to be gauged, explains Sanne, which means it will take time to determine whether the existing vaccines hold up against Omicron in the real world.In the meantime, the best way to avoid any type of infection from Omicron or any other variant is to get more people vaccinated and for governments to continue promoting public health measures such as social distancing and mask wearing. “Please get vaccinated and boosted and mask up in public, as the mutations in this virus likely result in high-level escape from neutralizing antibodies,” says Gupta.“The primary way to minimize the emergence of new variants is to limit ongoing transmissions,” adds Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa. “Viruses can't mutate if they can't replicate.”",
"Sometimes the best-laid trip plans get waylaid by illness, accidents, and world events. Travel insurance can help, but read the fine print.You’ve dreamed about this vacation for months, maybe years. You’ve researched it. You’ve saved for it. And now, due to reasons out of your control, you have to bag it.That scenario can hit anyone at any time. But over the past few weeks, it’s happened at an unprecedented rate as countries race to contain the spread of coronavirus. The virus has upped the risk factor for virtually all forms of travel. And in response to the constantly evolving crisis, airlines and hotels have become increasingly flexible about rebooking and credits, so it may be possible to rescue your plans—if you wait on hold long enough.It’s also made a lot of folks wonder: Would I not have to worry about this if I just bought travel insurance?According to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association, Americans spent nearly $3.8 billion on travel protection plans in 2018, up from $2.8 billion in 2016. Those numbers are likely to spike even higher this year due to anxiety over coronavirus. But as everyone in the travel industry has been repeating, insurance won’t necessarily help right now, even if you bought it long before Purell was selling out in stores.Find out why washing your hands was once controversial medical advice.“Fear is never covered,” explains Helen Prochilo, a Long Island travel agent. So if you want to bail on a trip because you think you could potentially get sick, you’d better have a Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR) policy. While the cost of a standard policy usually starts at about five percent of your total trip cost, a CFAR policy tends to push that up by about 50 percent. To insure your $6,000 summer trip to Norway would cost as little as $300 without CFAR, but would likely be upwards of $450 with it. In exchange, holders can recoup up to 75 percent of their losses as long as they back out of their trip at least two days before departure.Prochilo usually needs to break the bad news to her New York clients that they are barred from purchasing CFAR, but New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on March 6 — in light of complaints due to coronavirus — that residents will now have that option. (But, at least for now, these policies are only available from a handful of insurers and remain somewhat tricky to get.)These super-flexible policies make sense to Consumer Federation of America insurance expert Doug Heller. “A consumer can understand them,” he says, noting he’s purchased a CFAR policy when buying plane tickets to a meeting that seemed likely to get canceled. Want to find a regular policy that otherwise covers such a commonplace issue? Good luck. “My problem with travel insurance is that usually, it’s not worth it because of the narrowness of the coverage,” he explains.Some credit cards include travel insurance, but ask a lot of questions before relying on them.Calculating whether to shell out for any insurance depends on both how much the trip costs and the value you place on your peace of mind, notes Prochilo. She tells clients that if they can afford to lose everything they paid for their trip and foot the bill for hospital bills in another country, then they don’t need insurance. Although she doesn’t sell insurance, she often finds herself having to explain it to travelers, who generally are uneducated about their options. She recommends that clients call insurance companies to ask specific questions before buying. “It’s confusing even to us,” she says.The biggest reason people rely on their policies is due to illness, Prochilo says. The problem might arise beforehand, say breaking an ankle the day before a big ski vacation. That’s when trip cancellation protection can be handy.But Prochilo’s most dramatic client stories come from incidents when folks need to rely on medical coverage. One man got in a moped accident in Bermuda and racked up thousands of dollars in bills. Another client ended up in a hospital in the Dominican Republic for parasites. In situations like these, she says, having no international health coverage is a major problem. And that’s pretty common for Americans. (For example, Medicare covers very little abroad.)An American couple on a cruise in Mexico last year made headlines when their trip to the emergency room left them trapped until they could pay a $14,000 bill. Filmmaker Tyler Perry came forward and covered their bill, and they came home. But in case you don’t want to depend on a celebrity intervention, a travel insurance policy could also do the trick.Find out how not to get sick on a cruise ship.The key? Read the fine print, says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of Travelinsurance.com, one of several websites allowing customers to compare policies from multiple providers. Others include Squaremouth.com and Insuremytrip.com. Type in your destination, travel dates, total cost, and age of travelers, and these sites offer policy options at various price points. (You’ll notice prices shoot up for those over age 70.)Policies greatly differ by how much protection they offer, Sandberg says, so it’s important to do your research—and do it early. To nab a CFAR policy, for example, you need to lock it in within a certain number of days after the initial trip deposit date. If you have health problems, you’ll likely want a policy with a pre-existing condition waiver. Traveling to a remote corner of the world? Make sure the emergency evacuation coverage is high.Trip cancellation tends to be the priciest element of travel insurance, Sandberg says. If you want a cheaper option that just covers medical care and evacuation, enter a trip cost of $0 when you calculate or purchase a policy.Annual subscription options are available for frequent travelers. Some companies specialize in emergencies, such as Medjet, which, in addition to catering to business and leisure travelers, offers membership for expats and students studying abroad.Doing such a deep-dive analysis isn’t likely when you’re clicking a yes/no box after buying a plane ticket, says Heller, who notes that online travel websites often steer customers to a particular insurance plan and policy. “It’s bought without shopping most of the time,” he says. “The reason those companies get on the website for Expedia is they’re paying—call it ‘commissions’ or ‘kickbacks.’”If you do your homework on insurance, you may find you’re already covered by your credit cards. Some of them pay out for trip cancellation and interruption, delayed and lost baggage, rental car collision damage, travel accidents, and more.Heller says he reviews his contracts before a trip so he knows exactly what each card can offer in a specific situation. That way he knows which card offers the best protection for care rentals, flight cancellations, or whatever. “It’s worth educating yourself on the phone. It’s hard to read these policies even for someone who knows the industry,” he says.But don’t just assume your card has enough coverage, warns Prochilo. She had a client planning a $14,000 cruise who insisted her credit card would protect the trip no matter what happened. Then Prochilo checked her policy. It had a cap of $3,500. The client purchased travel insurance, which turned out to be a smart choice when her husband developed pneumonia right before the trip.",
"Doctors at a German clinic prepare for an operation by washing their hands. Scrubbing didn't become standard until the late 19th century.To avoid spreading illnesses like influenza and coronavirus, perhaps the least controversial—and most effective—tactic is to wash your hands. The Center for Disease Control advocates a 20-second scrub with soap and water, but this advice wasn’t always considered common sense. In the 19th century, it was scandalous.In Europe in the 1840s, many new mothers were dying from an ailment known as puerperal fever, or childbed fever. Even under the finest medical care available, women would fall ill and die shortly after giving birth. Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis was intrigued by the problem and sought its origins. (How trillions of microbes affect our everyday life.)Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures but was ridiculed for his work linking handwashing to better medical care.Semmelweis worked in the Vienna General Hospital in Austria, which had two separate maternity wards: one staffed by male doctors and the other by female midwives. He noticed that the mortality rate from the fever was much lower when midwives delivered babies. Women under the care of doctors and medical students were dying at more than twice the rate of the midwives’ patients.The doctor tested a number of hypotheses for the phenomenon. Semmelweiss investigated whether a woman’s body position during birth had an impact. He studied if the literal embarrassment of being examined by a male doctors was causing the fever. Perhaps, he thought, it was the priests attending to patients dying of the fever that scared the new mothers to death. Semmelweis assessed each factor and then ruled them out.After removing these other variables, Semmelweis found the culprit: cadavers. In the mornings at the hospital, doctors observed and assisted their students with autopsies as part of their medical training. Then, in the afternoons, the physicians and students worked in the maternity ward examining patients and delivering babies. The midwives had no such contact: They only worked in their ward.Semmelweis hypothesized that “cadaverous particles” were being transferred from dead bodies to new mothers by the doctors and their students. Physicians did not have to scrub their hands in between patient visits, unlike today. Whatever pathogens they came in contact with during an autopsy would be taken into the maternity ward.Painter Robert Thom depicts Semmelweis (center) in the Vienna General Hospital in Austria overseeing doctors washing their hands before examining obstetric patients.Germ theory was in still in its infancy (scientists Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister were a few decades away from their influential work), so rather than “germs” Semmelweiss called the agents “decomposing animal organic matter.” Women became infected with the particles and died of the fever after coming into contact with the doctors. (Before vaccines, smallpox killed 3 out of 10 infected people.)In 1847, Semmelweis implemented mandatory handwashing among the students and doctors who worked for him at the Vienna General Hospital. Rather than relying on plain soap, Semmelweiss used a chlorinated lime solution because it totally removed the smell of decay that lingered on the doctors’ hands. The staff began sanitizing themselves and their instruments. The mortality rate in the physician-run maternity ward plummeted.In the spring of 1850, Semmelweis took the stage at the prestigious Vienna Medical Society and extolled the virtues of hand washing to a crowd of doctors. His theory flew in the face of accepted medical wisdom of the time and was rejected by the medical community, who faulted both his science and his logic. Historians believe they also rejected his theory because it blamed them for their patients’ deaths. Despite reversing the mortality rates in the maternity wards, the Vienna Hospital abandoned mandatory handwashing.When the H1N1 flu strain loomed in 2009, school children in Milan, Italy, regularly washed their hands to prevent contagion.The Center for Disease Control recommends the public follow these guidelines to stop the spread of germs.1. Wet your hands in running water and apply soap. Neither the temperature of the water nor the type of soap you use (antibacterial or otherwise) impacts how many microbes are removed.2. Lather the soap by rubbing your hands together. The friction will increase the number of microbes removed.3. Scrub for at least 20 seconds, or the approximate amount of time it takes to hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice.4. Rinse your hands completely in clean, running water. Studies have not shown that using a paper towel to turn off the faucet improves health, according the the CDC.5. Dry your hands either on a clean towel or by air drying them.The ensuing years were difficult for Semmelweis. He left Vienna and went to Pest in Hungary where he also worked in a maternity ward. He instituted his handwashing practice there and, as in Vienna, drastically reduced the rate of maternal mortality. Yet his success at saving lives earned no acceptance of his ideas.Semmelweis published articles on handwashing in 1858 and 1860 followed by a book a year later, but his theories were still not embraced by the establishment. His book was widely condemned by doctors with other theories for the continuing spread of childbed fever.A few years later, Semmelweis’s health began to deteriorate. Some believe he was suffering from syphilis or Alzheimer’s disease. He was committed to a mental institution and died not long after, possibly due to sepsis caused by an infected wound on his hand.In 1867, two years after Semmelweis’ death, Scottish surgeon Joseph Lister also propelled the idea of sanitizing hands and surgical instruments to halt infectious diseases. His ideas had their critics, too, but in the 1870s physicians began regularly scrubbing up before surgery.Not long after, others began to recognize the earlier work of Semmelweis. His work later led to Louis Pasteur’s development of germ theory, which changed how doctors care for their patients and investigate the cause and spread of diseases. (Teaching people to be healthy has come a long way.)In a sketch, Semmelweis washes his hands in chlorinated lime solution. Although his work led to safer medical practices, it was not recognized until after his death in 1865.Surgeons began regularly scrubbing up in the 1870s, but the importance of everyday handwashing did not become universal until more than a century later. It wasn’t until the 1980s that hand hygiene was officially incorporated into American health care with the first national hand hygiene guidelines. More than a century after Semmelweis’s theories were mocked, the Medical University of Budapest changed its name to Semmelweis University, in honor of his unsung persistence to improve healthcare through cleanliness.",
"“You know how Roman cities were buried over time with debris? Same thing happens to bedding.”Philip Tierno is describing your mattress. And your pillow. And other soft, squishy surfaces. The New York University pathologist and self-described microbe hunter wrote a book called the The Secret Life of Germs. He knows where they are lurking.While the average bed might sound like a parthenon of microbial life and pathogens, it's surprisingly not even the most germ-ridden part of a home, says Tierno.“Germs are ubiquitous,” he adds. “All living beings, rocks, soil... are riddled with germs. We came from primordial single cells. Germs were here before us.”They're on you even now, and on the screen from which you're reading. Pervasive as they are, the unseen life forms are (usually) nothing to fear. Arming yourself against any potential disease-causing agents requires simply understanding your germy adversary.So what are germs, really? Tiny organisms are everywhere, but the ones considered “germs" includes a number of species of bacteria and viruses. You might also find disease-causing fungi and protozoa in a home, especially in areas that are exposed to humidity.In the bathroom, for instance, water that comes into contact with a hard surface can create what's called a biofilm, a slimy film of microorganisms.In a study published in the journal Biofilms and Microbiomes late last month, researchers dissected rubber ducks—the plastic toys that linger in bathtubs. Inside, they found pathogenic bacteria in 80 percent of the toys they tested.Surprising as it may be, Tierno says if you're swabbing for germs in the bathroom, you still haven't found the germiest place in the home.“It is cleaner to eat from a toilet, compared to the drain,” he says, referring to the kitchen drain. “The sink drain is the dirtiest area of the house.”It's closely followed by the kitchen sponge, he adds.A 2011 study by NSF International, a consumer safety organization, categorized the household objects with the highest germ count. Only differing slightly from Tierno, they found sponges and dish rags were the dirtiest household items, followed by kitchen sinks, toothbrush holders, pet bowls, coffee reservoirs, bathroom faucet handles, pet toys, countertops, stove knobs, and cutting boards.There are three ways that human beings generate germs, says Tierno. The first is the skin. Your biggest organ is a home to hundreds of different kinds of germs, and everyday they slough off.The second source of germs comes from your respiratory tree—your mouth and nose. Talking, coughing, and sneezing are common ways to impart germs into the air.The third way humans generate germs is found at the opposite end of the body.“There are more germs in a single teaspoon of feces than there were men who walked the face of the Earth,” says Tierno.It's the germs born here that make the kitchen one of the dirtiest rooms in any given house. Remnants from livestock enter the kitchen on meat, or from the fertilizer used to grow vegetables.“On every pillow in my home, we have a barrier protector. The same with every mattress,” says Tierno. This allergen cover, he says, prevents germs from accumulating over time.Germs may accumulate easy, he adds, but ridding them from a home simply requires some regular upkeep. Hand washing is also an essential step to keep germs from entering your body.To really break up the biofilms in a home, Tierno recommends scrubbing surfaces with a metal brush, soap, and water, and a 10 percent bleach solution when it's really needed. Most people, he adds, have strong enough immune systems to fend off household germs on their own, but as modern medicine allows people with suppressed immune systems to live longer, a greater number of people are more susceptible to the germs around us.",
"When the plague swept through England in the 1660s, it killed some 100,000 Londoners. To warn of disease, “plague crosses” marked victims’ doors, along with the words “Lord have mercy upon us.”Public health warnings have evolved since then. In the book and exhibit “Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?” designers Lucienne Roberts and Rebecca Wright examine how public health messages are communicated. By the 19th century, Roberts says, mass media, medical science, and graphic design were adept at teaching people about health and disease. Tuberculosis inspired the United States’ first big health-education campaign, with one poster discouraging “careless spitting, coughing, sneezing.” The number of deaths fell steadily between 1900 and 1940.Both world wars sparked campaigns against sexually transmitted diseases. World War I–era posters warned soldiers against promiscuity while pointedly avoiding words such as “syphilis” and “gonorrhea.” By World War II, language was more explicit: “You can’t beat the Axis if you get VD,” scolded one American poster. Starting in the 1980s, posters corrected misinformation about HIV/AIDS and urged condom use.Roberts says that the link between design and public health extends beyond publicity campaigns. Some U.K. hospitals revamped emergency room signs to better inform people about wait times and triage. This helped drive a 50 percent decline in violent waiting room outbursts, she says: “The root thing that needed to change [was] information.”Graphic design’s influence on public health can be lasting. A red cross once warned of plague’s presence. Now a different take on the symbol is one of the world’s most recognizable icons—and a reassuring beacon of health and safe haven.",
"The Diamond Princess cruise ship (shown docked in Yokohama, Japan, on February 10) was quarantined in the city after passengers tested positive for coronavirus.When passengers booked their vacations on the ill-fated Diamond Princess, they were likely looking forward to hanging out in a hot tub, not a hot zone. Now most of them are quarantined off the coast of Japan, hoping to avoid testing positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus, which has already infected more than 200 people on the cruise ship.The fact that the largest outbreak of COVID-19 outside of mainland China is happening on a cruise can’t be reassuring to travelers who are already skittish about health issues on boat-based trips, which are well known incubators of gastrointestinal illnesses. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a helpful database of cases, broken down by year.The vast majority of cruises don’t experience any problems. But confined spaces mean that even one sick person can create a serious situation, explains Tullia Marcolongo, executive director of the nonprofit International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers. “It’s the domino effect, and you have nowhere to go,” she says.Health officials in protective gear removed suitcases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan. It’s believed they belonged to passengers evacuated and taken to hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus.Cruise companies work to minimize the risk of illness by maintaining cleanliness and monitoring health on board their ships. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Carnival—the parent company of Princess Cruises—has introduced expanded protocols, including “enhanced onboard sanitation measures with non-toxic materials” and “pre-boarding medical evaluations, as needed.” On its website, Royal Caribbean Cruises touts its health and safety program, such as internal and external inspections, frequent water systems testing, and strict food handling rules.Passengers can do their part, too. “The first thing I would say is that the power is in your hands,” Marcolongo says. She means that literally. Frequent hand washing can be a critical preventative measure for norovirus, colds, and other yucky things circulating on a ship. To make sure you scrub long enough, sing “Happy Birthday” twice, she suggests, and don’t miss the spots between your fingers. If there’s no soap and water nearby, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Many ships make sanitizer stands readily available to passengers, Marcolongo adds.David Parenti, director of the George Washington University Traveler’s Clinic and professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, advises being aware of when you’ve held handrails and touched other surfaces. Until you can wash your hands, don’t stick them in your eyes or mouth.Unfortunately, Parenti says, there are lots of other ways to get sick, both on ship and on land. “It all has to do with luck. If you’re on a ship with norovirus, that’s bad luck. If you are on a cruise ship, you will need to eat. Those risks are something you don’t have a lot of control over,” he says.This is where you should sit on the plane to avoid getting sick.To be proactive, travelers can set up a pre-vacation doctor’s appointment to make sure their immunizations are up to date. Depending on your destination, that flu shot might be important even if you’re taking off in the middle of the summer. “Keep in mind that the U.S. influenza season is the opposite of the Southern Hemisphere,” Parenti notes. He recommends getting the vaccine for Hepatitis A and checking on your immunity to measles; you could possibly use another shot. (A measles case was responsible for a different cruise quarantine in May 2019.)Because of the limited number of medications on board, it’s smart to pack whatever you think you might need, Marcolongo adds. That includes first-aid basics as well as some standard over-the-counter supplies, which for gastrointestinal issues include Loperamide (Immodium) and oral rehydration salts.Miami-based attorney Jack Hickey once represented cruise companies—and now sues them over personal injury claims. His advice? “What I tell people is get trip insurance and make sure it covers an air ambulance.” Travelers who experience emergencies and need to pay for transportation will be in for some serious sticker shock otherwise.Be realistic about what kind of care you can actually expect on board a ship. “If you get sick or injured, get back to the U.S. as quickly as possible,” Hickey advises. Although cruises undoubtably excel at hospitality, he says, they tend to be lacking when it comes to medical care. “It’s not a hospital, but a ship carrying 3,000 to 6,000 people and going to isolated areas of the world,” says Hickey, who thinks there typically aren’t enough doctors and staff to handle a heavy workload, and that the facilities aren’t adequately equipped. “Almost uniformly, they have X-ray machines. But [ships] do not have good machines or people who know how to read films well,” he says.The coronavirus quarantine—which is keeping people cooped up in tight cabins for weeks—is a reminder that mental health problems could also arise, especially for anyone with issues around anxiety or claustrophobia. “Travel insurance doesn’t necessarily cover that,” Marcolongo notes.Learn how the coronavirus compares to Ebola, flu, and other outbreaks.As scientists learn more about the virus and how it’s transmitted, there may be more scrutiny of ventilation systems on cruise ships, Parenti adds. In a hospital, it’s possible to put a patient in a “respiratory isolation” room with frequent air exchanges.That’s not an option for most cruise accommodations. The next best choice, according to Parenti? “I would take a window, personally.” At least you could open it and get a breeze that way.",
"In Beijing, China, people wear protective masks as they wait to board a train on January 21.In just three weeks, an outbreak of a new virus with pneumonia-like symptoms has spread from a wildlife market in central China to become a global threat, with hundreds of cases reported worldwide and at least two in the U.S. To date, this coronavirus has caused at least two dozen deaths and spurred the Chinese government to effectively shut down movement in 12 cities, including Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the virus started.With January 25 marking the start of the Lunar New Year, the outbreak comes at a time when around three billion travelers were expected to crisscross China over the 15-day period that’s known as the world’s largest annual human migration. It’s enough to worry international experts, though the World Health Organization has so far stopped short of declaring a global public-health emergency. Unsurprisingly, many Chinese have already canceled their holiday travel plans, while airports across the world have implemented screening measures.Should travelers stay home? Here’s what to know.There are many types of coronaviruses, which cause everything from the common cold to more serious zootonic maladies (like the Wuhan one) that spread from animals to humans. What’s particularly concerning about the Wuhan coronavirus is that it originated in a wildlife market, much like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. As National Geographic’s Nsikan Akpan reports, zoonotic diseases “rank among the world’s most infamous” and include potentially deadly infections HIV and Ebola.Public health officials don’t yet know how contagious this virus is. So far, evidence suggests that older adults and people with existing health conditions are at greatest risk. But there’s still much left to learn, says Brian Garibaldi, medical director of the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit. “One of the challenges now is that we just don’t understand what the degree of risk is in terms of human-to-human spread,” he says. “We’re still understanding how serious this virus will be for the average person.”On January 22, citizens in Guangzhou, China, wear masks as they are screened for the new coronavirus, which started in the city of Wuhan.Wuhan—home to more people than New York City—is a major air and rail transit hub. If you’re heading through or to the centrally located city, you’ll need to change plans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends avoiding all non-essential travel to Wuhan. Chinese authorities are also shutting off transportation out of the city (and out of neighboring cities Huanggang and Ezhou) in a quarantine that the New York Times describes as “unprecedented.’’Public transportation within the city has also been curtailed. And the local government has canceled public activities for Lunar New Year, including an annual event at the Guiyuan Temple that attracted 700,000 tourists last year. Officials are also imposing travel restrictions on residents of smaller neighboring cities Chibi and Zhijiang.In an effort to contain the virus, Chinese authorities have been imposing restrictions on mass gatherings—including planned Lunar New Year celebrations. In Beijing, the Washington Post reports that the normally bustling Forbidden City, one of the country’s top tourist attractions, has closed until further notice. Authorities have also shut down a section of the Great Wall of China that’s closest to Beijing as well as sites including the National Museum of China. The capital city has canceled all large-scale holiday events such as temple fairs. Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown announced a temporary closure, promising to assist guests with refunds.You may begin to see cities in other parts of China or the region close attractions and call off events as new information emerges. Macau, for example, has canceled its Lunar New Year parade; the Hong Kong Football Association has scrapped its Lunar New Year Cup.Should you avoid all large gatherings in Asia? Garibaldi says that the best thing to do is stay informed on the latest developments before making decisions.Related: How did the Wuhan coronavirus spread?If you have booked travel routed through Wuhan, check with your airline or travel agency to see if you’re eligible for a refund. Cathay Pacific Airways is waiving rebooking, rerouting, and refund charges for all tickets arriving to or departing from Wuhan issued on or before January 21 for travel between now and March 31, 2020. Several other airlines, travel agencies, and hotel groups are offering refunds as well. Wuhan tourism authorities are also requiring travel agencies to grant refunds for group tours, which were suspended even before the quarantine.Cases of the coronavirus have also been reported in cities across China and the region. As of January 24, the CDC recommends travelers take the usual precautions when traveling to China: avoiding contact with sick people, washing hands often with soap and water, and avoiding animals and their products (i.e. uncooked meat). Flights are still operating normally outside of Wuhan, but check with your airline or tour operator for up-to-the-minute information. If you’ve purchased travel insurance, check your policy to find out if it covers cancellation or emergency medical coverage.Garibaldi suggests travelers keep checking the CDC’s latest travel advisories for updates, including new regions at risk. “The best thing is to stay informed, because things are going to be changing pretty rapidly over the next few days,” he says.Air travelers departing China—particularly those who have passed through Wuhan—can expect to have their temperatures checked. In the U.S., the CDC has been screening passengers from Wuhan at major airports in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta. The Associated Press has an extensive list of airports worldwide conducting screening.Cruise lines are also being affected. The International Business Times reports that Astro Ocean Cruises and Costa Cruises are both planning to offer refunds to any passenger who has a fever or has been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line is screening passengers departing from Chinese ports and denying entry to anyone who has been to Wuhan in the last 30 days or has a body temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or more.Garibaldi says that health screenings serve two purposes: They allow officials to identify, quickly isolate, and treat infected individuals, and they also remind healthy passengers to seek care immediately if they start to show symptoms.China has ordered all travel agencies to suspend sales of domestic and international tours. But if you’re booking on your own, Garibaldi says, the key is to be flexible in your travel plans if new information comes to light. “Now is not the time to take a long vacation and not look at your phone or check the news if you’re traveling in one of these areas,” he says.",
"Celebrated around the world, it usually prompts the planet’s largest annual migration of people. And though it is known to some in the West as Chinese New Year, it isn’t just celebrated in China. Lunar New Year falls this year on Sunday, January 22, 2023, kicking off the Year of the Rabbit. It is traditionally a time for family reunions, plenty of food, and some very loud celebrations.Modern China actually uses a Gregorian calendar like most of the rest of the world. Its holidays, however, are governed by its traditional lunisolar calendar, which may have been in use from as early as the 21st century B.C. When the newly founded Republic of China officially adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1912, its leaders rebranded the observation of the Lunar New Year as Spring Festival, as it is known in China today.(Learn why some people celebrate Christmas in January.)As its name suggests, the date of the lunar new year depends on the phase of the moon and varies from year to year. Each year in the lunar calendar is named one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, which are derived from ancient Chinese folklore. Repeating in a rotating basis, these animals are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.Today, Spring Festival is celebrated in China and Hong Kong; Lunar New Year is also celebrated in South Korea, Tibet, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and places with large Chinese populations. Though the festival varies by country, it is dominated by themes of reunion and hope.For Chinese people, Spring Festival lasts for 40 days and has multiple sub-festivals and rituals. The New Year itself is a seven-day-long state holiday, and on the eve of the new year, Chinese families traditionally celebrate with a massive reunion dinner. Considered the year’s most important meal, it is traditionally held in the house of the most senior family member.(Learn about Lunar New Year with your kids.)The holiday may be getting more modern, but millennia-old traditions are still held dear in China and other countries. In China, people customarily light firecrackers, which are thought to chase away the fearful monster Nian. (However, the tradition has been on the decline in recent years due to air pollution restrictions that have hit the fireworks industry hard.) The color red is used in clothing and decorations to ensure prosperity, and people exchange hongbao, red envelopes filled with lucky cash.Meanwhile in Korea, people make rice cake soup and honor their ancestors during Seollal. And during Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, flowers play an important role in the celebrations.Lunar New Year has even spawned its own form of travel: During chunyun, or spring migration, hundreds of million people travel to their hometowns in China for family reunions and New Year’s celebrations. In past years, billions of travelers have taken to the road during the 40-day period. Known as the world’s largest human migration, chunyun regularly clogs already busy roads, trains and airports—proof of the holiday’s enduring significance for those who associate it with luck and love.This story was originally published on January 2, 2020.

"Lanterns glow at Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during Chinese New Year.Chinese New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more like 40 days of celebrations. The travel involved has been called the largest annual human migration in the entire world. China holds 1.4 billion people (18.4 percent of the world’s total population, but who’s counting?) and every year, nearly three billion people fan across the country, returning to their hometowns. Here are 10 essential things to know about this massive, annual event.And the holiday is not celebrated just in mainland China and Hong Kong. For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival, and it’s celebrated widely in Taiwan and across Southeast Asia in countries with large Chinese populations, like Singapore and Malaysia. In Korea, Lunar New Year is called Seollal; in Vietnam, Tet; and in Tibet, Losar. (See Hong Kong like a Nat Geo Explorer.)A reveler burns joss sticks for incense at Thean Hou Temple in Kuala Lumpur on the eve of the Lunar New Year.In Mandarin, they’ll say gong xi fa cai (恭喜发财), wishing you a prosperous New Year. In Cantonese, it’s gong hey fat choi. Still, if you wish someone xin nian kuai le (新年快乐), literally "happy new year," that’s perfectly welcome, too.Leading up to and during Spring Festival, the streets of Chinese cities used to sounded like war zones, with firecrackers exploding all night. Following a big clampdown on people setting off their own fireworks in urban areas, you’ll most likely only hear these sounds in smaller towns and the countryside. The firecrackers serve two purposes: One, they’re fun and celebratory; two, they were traditionally set off to scare away dragon-lion monster Nian—who, as legend has it, would attack villagers and sometimes eat children but could be frightened off by loud noises. (Learn about other top New Year's celebrations around the world.)This year is the Year of the Pig. There are twelve Chinese Zodiac signs, and these are taken far more seriously than a back-of-tabloid horoscope. Some signs, like the dragon, are coveted, because dragons are considered to be authoritative, strong, and successful. Couples will aim to have babies in dragon years. Certain signs are said to match well with others: Dog (sincere, loyal, independent) and Rabbit (sensitive, modest, warm) are believed to be a good pairing. Your sign is determined by birth year—using the lunar calendar—so if you were born between, say, February 17, 1988 and February 5, 1989, you’re a dragon. You would think that your Zodiac year (benming nian, 本命年) would be lucky, but it’s the opposite. You’ll need to watch out for and ward off bad luck. How to do so? Well ...Festive pig-themed decorations cover Yuyuan Garden ahead of the Lunar New Year in Shanghai, China. The Lunar New Year begins on February 5, 2019, marking the beginning of the Year of the Pig.In traditional and contemporary Chinese culture, red represents prosperity and happiness. It’s considered a lucky color, and people will wear it in celebration, and to usher in an auspicious new year and to keep away bad vibes. Jumpsuits, sweaters, trousers, scarves, socks, hats, anything is game. If it’s your Zodiac year you should wear more red than others, to buffer yourself from misfortune. Plus, in addition to being scared of loud noise, monster Nian is fearful of red. So, maybe red’s not your favorite color, or maybe you want to be protected closely, every single day. That’s where red underwear becomes useful. Go into any department store from December through February, or stop at one of the many street stalls selling socks and underwear, and you’ll see pair after pair of red.Walk around older neighborhoods in any Chinese city (or in the countryside) and see peoples’ windows, walls, and doors adorned. Squares of red paper with white characters like 福 (fú, good fortune) are pasted up diagonally. Red paper cuttings get taped onto windows, so passersby can admire them, and red banners (two vertical, with an optional third hanging horizontally) showcase Spring Festival couplets in gold. Likewise, in older neighborhoods, it’s not uncommon to see huge salt-cured fish hanging from power lines, drying next to the laundry. Symbolizing prosperity, fish is a must for Chinese New Year. Fish (鱼, yu) is a homonym of 余 (yu), meaning surplus or extra. In public buildings like offices, hotels, and malls, visitors will notice tasseled, red-paper lanterns strung up, and kumquat trees positioned for good luck and wealth. In Mandarin, a kumquat is called jinju (金橘), and jin (金) is the word for gold.Children help to change lanterns for the upcoming year in an old building of Yangjia village in Lin'an, China.Hongbao (红包), literally "red packet," is a key element of Chinese New Year. The cash inside is considered lucky money for the upcoming year. Hongbao are generally given by elders to the younger generations, especially children, but if you earn well, it’s polite to share with your parents and grandparents this time of year. If you’re married, you have to give hongbao; if you’re single, you usually receive it. If invited to someone’s house for Chinese New Year and you know they have kids, it’s nice to put a little bit of cash into a hongbao. If you’re traveling in the north, go for a round number; in the south, use lucky numbers (anything with six or eight). Don’t give a multiple of four, as the number is a homonym for death.It’s nice to go into a new year without split ends, but for many people celebrating Spring Festival, it’s more than that. Before midnight on New Year’s Day, hair salons are abuzz with revelers, wishing to cut away last year’s bad luck and walk out with a clean, shiny slate. Then it’s no washing for 24 hours, to avoid scrubbing away the good luck.Lion dancers perform during the opening ceremony of the Ditan Park temple fair on the eve of the Lunar New Year in Beijing.China’s generation of only children are now in their early 30s and many are being nagged by two parents and four grandparents to settle down and have kids.

Prices vary, but expect to pay around $10 per hour, and more per day if your faux-beau has to travel a long distance to your hometown. (Read about the young and lonely hearts of China’s shrinking cities.)Spring Festival is mostly celebrated at home, with family. Restaurants are closed, but leading up to the New Year, tuck into heaping plates of dumplings (饺子, jiao zi)—which sounds like 交子 (jiāo zi); the second symbol, 交 (jiao) means "exchange”, 子(zi) is an abbreviation for 11 p.m – 1 a.m.. So put together, you’re exchanging the old year for the new with pillowy pockets of dough. With the ban on fireworks in cities, you won’t be shooting off pop rockets (your ears will thank you). Short of inviting yourself over to someone’s house for dinner, the best bet for participating is at fairs inside temples in Beijing. The largest takes place at Ditan Park, where a canopy of red lanterns is strung overhead and performances are held daily: Tibetan folk dancing, a reenactment of the imperial family’s traditional harvest prayers, and magic shows entertain all ages. Handicrafts are for sale, such as snacks like niangao (the holiday glutinous rice square) and jiaoquan (a savory cruller best dipped in doujiang, or fresh soy milk).Each summer, thousands of people on horseback and foot flock to southern Spain, a celebration of Pentecost called the Pilgrimage of Rocío.",

Masters carry gunpowder-filled bamboo cylinders in their arms as sparks fly and flames shoot out.Independence Day in the United States is approaching and, like every Fourth of July since 1777, this year’s celebrations will undoubtedly involve fireworks of many different styles, colors, and sizes; from elaborately orchestrated displays over the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to fizzing handheld sparklers waved around suburban yards. (See pictures of red, white, and blue animals for the Fourth of July.)Celebratory fireworks have been exploding in the skies for centuries and, of course, their appeal is not limited to the U.S. The earliest documented use of fireworks dates back to ninth-century China and to this day they remain an integral part of cultural celebrations such as Chinese New Year throughout the country, from the major cities to rural villages. China may have invented fireworks (which Marco Polo brought to Europe in 1295), but the colorful displays you see today are courtesy of Italian pyrotechnicians who, in the 1830s, roughly a thousand years later, figured out that metallic powders could be used to create specific colors.Fireworks, then, are a truly global phenomenon, as the pictures in this gallery, taken by members of our Your Shot photography community, prove.

"The winning photo was taken during peak cherry blossom season, with Mount Fuji framed by a five-story pagoda in Arakurayama Sengen Park.For the second time in its history National Geographic Traveler went to Your Shot, National Geographic’s photo community, to find the cover image for its June/July Issue: The Trip That Changed My Life. The community submitted nearly 19,000 photos for consideration, and 15 images made it to the final story.One image rose to the top, an image nearly a decade in the making, by longtime Your Shot member Takashi Nakazawa.Nakazawa is from Tokyo, Japan, and fell in love with Mount Fuji when he first visited it seven years ago. Since then, he's traveled to the mountain almost every single weekend, amassing an estimated 70,000 photos. He often makes the drive from Tokyo in the dark of the night, and stops at a nearby mountain, lake, or road, and sleeps in his car until dawn, his favorite time to photograph the mountain.One glance at his profile makes his love for the mountain clear: In every season, time of day, and at great distances, Nakazawa has developed a series that resembles a portrait series rather than a landscapes series.Nakazawa's hundreds of trips to photograph Fuji might lead to the assumption he has summited the mountain—a popular tourist activity in the area. “I never thought about climbing up it,” he admits. “I cannot hike Mount Fuji because then I cannot take a photo of Mount Fuji.” When he puts it that way, it makes perfect sense.Nakazawa says he hopes that he can portray the beauty of Mount Fuji to make people around the world happy, and inspire them to visit themselves. He believes that by visiting, they will find the spirit of Mount Fuji and in turn understand the country itself. "Mount Fuji is very simply a symbol of Japan," he says.Know Before You Go: Nakazawa will tell you that any time of year is a great time to visit, and while this is true, peak times to visit are July and August for climbing, or in the spring for hanami, the tradition of viewing of flowers during cherry blossom season. Though nature is always hard to predict, early morning will usually be your best shot for getting a clear sky to view the mountain, as well as cooler months.If you are visiting Tokyo, a two-hour drive will get you to Mount Fuji if you are looking to climb. You can make it to Hakone in about an hour, a popular spot for viewing Mount Fuji, and you can make a day of it by visiting the town's art museums and onsen, or hot springs. Lake Yamanaka is another popular spot for viewing the mountain, about a 90-minute drive from Tokyo.

"Photographing fireworks can be challenging but it's not impossible. Here we share tips and tricks for taking the guesswork out of shooting this nighttime event, and getting inspired to capture your own unique perspective.This allows you to control the exposure and aperture yourself. A good starting place for your settings is ISO 100, f/11, at 1/2 second. If the photos are looking too dim, vary the shutter speed while keeping the aperture the same.Before the show begins, think about the foreground and background elements of the scene and how you might want to incorporate them. Manually set the focus for your scene before it gets dark. Focus on an area of sky where the fireworks will be, or on an object the same distance away. Once the fireworks start, you’ll be ready to start shooting.Keep your camera motionless by using a sturdy tripod and a shutter release cord. When shooting a scene that includes not just the sky but also other elements like a cityscape, keeping the horizon line straight is particularly important. Make sure your camera is level on the tripod.The focal length you need depends on your distance from the burst and what you’re trying to capture. If you want a tight shot that shows detail, you will want to use a zoom lens that goes to at least 200mm. Keep in mind that changing focal length will require refocusing in most zoom lenses. Check for this attribute before the show begins, while it is still light.This allows you to create timed exposures based on changing conditions. You will want to use a type of remote shutter release to avoid touching the camera. Hit the shutter as the firework is launching and hold it down until the burst has faded, typically a few seconds.This makes for more comfortable shooting conditions, and from the right vantage point, the reflective quality of the smoke can add an element of interest to the shot.When people are the main subject of your shot, expose for the faces, rather than the light source, to avoid fooling the light meter.",
"While ramen, with its bold broth, shines as the star of Japanese noodles in America, gentle, subtle soba is starting to make inroads. The buckwheat flour noodles, usually about the size of spaghetti, don’t take as easily to mechanized manufacturing or storage as ramen or udon, so the fragile, fresh version requires extra effort to find.Some grocery stores do sell dried versions of soba, but they have just a token amount of buckwheat flour. It’s the buckwheat’s nuttiness that gives the noodle its signature flavor—as well as its health benefits. Copious soba consumption began in Japan during the Edo period, around 1600, as a way to fend off beriberi, a disease caused by a thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency. Beriberi was common in Japan because of the country’s dependence on polished white rice, which has little thiamine, explains Seattle soba-making chef Mutsuko Soma.Soma’s inspiration for opening a soba restaurant came from her grandmother, who made the noodles for most family gatherings, including New Year’s Eve, when the noodles are traditionally eaten to promote longevity. It’s considered lucky because the slurping and lip-smacking noises made when eating soba (“tsuru tsuru, kame kame,”) sound the same as the names for the long-lived crane and turtle.Soba really gained popularity in Japan through restaurants specializing in the dish and small stands peddling the noodles as an everyday food of the masses. The rest of the world caught on. Restaurants like Soma's Kamonegi in Seattle, Ichimi Ann in Los Angeles, and Sobaya in New York City serve the noodles in traditional styles—zaru soba, chilled with a light dipping sauce, or bukkake soba, prepared in a warm broth—and with a variety of toppings or garnishes, often tempura or duck. (In fact, Kamonegi’s name is taken from the Japanese words for duck and leek.) When diners finish their soba, they commonly request soba-yu, or the cooking water from the noodles, full of nutrients, to mix with leftover dipping sauce and drink as a soup. [See how Japanese mochi is made.]No matter how it’s served, the principles of soba stay the same: simplicity and the familiar notes of buckwheat.",
"During the 20th century, Americans developed a love affair with pasta. On the big screen, spaghetti played memorable roles in classic films such as the Marx Brothers’ Night at the Opera (1935), Disney’s Lady and the Tramp (1955), and Goodfellas (1990).Pasta became an increasingly common sight on restaurant menus in the United States, but the Italians’ love affair with pasta has a long, complex, and passionate history. The route by which spaghetti, ravioli, and tortellini became international household names has taken some surprising turns over the centuries.Made from the flour of durum wheat, pasta takes its name from the pasty texture of the dough when it is first mixed. Different pastas have different names, many based on the different shapes the dough is molded into. Fresh pasta is often mixed, cooked, and eaten right away, whereas pasta secca is dried in order to be stored; it is often prepared later by cooking it in boiling water.The production process is simple, but the uses the finished product are put to are dizzyingly varied. The different shapes of pasta—cut into squares, rolled into tubes, pulled into long strings, and twisted into spirals—stretch to at least 200 types, any one of which might be used in a huge array of sauces and accompaniments, all with their regional variations.Pasta’s ethnic roots have been long debated. Many theories have been put forward, some notably far-fetched. An enduring myth, based on the writings of the 13th-century explorer Marco Polo, that pasta was brought to Italy from China, rose from a misinterpretation of a famous passage in Polo’s Travels. In it, Polo mentions a tree from which something like pasta was made. It was probably the sago palm, which produces a starchy food that resembles, but is not pasta. This food almost certainly reminded the Venetian traveler of the pasta of his home country. Even while Polo was away on his travels in the 1270s, there is a reference to a soldier in the northern Italian city of Genoa, who owned a basket of “macaronis.” A century before, the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi wrote of seeing pasta produced on Sicily.Many Italian writers have argued that a tomb from the fourth century B.C. bears a relief of pasta-making equipment, suggesting the dish was being enjoyed in pre-Roman Italy. Many food historians, however, dispute this interpretation of the relief. They point out that Roman-era references to anything resembling pasta are scarce, and that the dish probably took hold in Italy as a result of extensive Mediterranean trading in the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, references to pasta dishes—macaroni, ravioli, gnocchi, vermicelli—crop up with increasing frequency across the Italian Peninsula.“It can be bought everywhere and in all the shops for very little money. As a rule it is simply cooked in water and seasoned with grated cheese.” One day he was visiting Agrigento in Sicily with some friends. They stayed in the home of a family who gave them a dish of macaroni, whose shape, texture, and color fascinated the German writer. As they sat at the table, their hosts explained that this type of pasta was made only from the highest quality hard wheat, and then formed by hand into a spiral shape like a snail’s shell. “This macaroni they served us was exquisite ... The pasta seemed unparalleled to me in its whiteness and fineness.”Pasta’s popularity is mentioned by the 14th-century writer Boccaccio. In his collection of earthy tales, The Decameron, he recounts a mouthwatering fantasy concerning a mountain of Parmesan cheese down which pasta chefs roll macaroni and ravioli to gluttons waiting below.In the 1390s Franco Sacchetti, another poet and writer of tales, also tells how two friends meet up to eat macaroni. They both eat from the same dish, as was the custom of the time, but one of them has more of an appetite than the other: “Noddo started to pile the macaroni together, roll it up and swallow it down. He had sent six mouthfuls down the hatch while Giovanni’s first one was still on the fork. He did not dare put it in his mouth as the food was steaming.”What did the pasta that Noddo bolts down with such relish taste like? Throughout the Middle Ages, until the start of the 16th century, pasta dishes were markedly different from those eaten today. Not only was pasta cooked for longer—there was none of the modern-day preference for pasta al dente—it was also mixed with ingredients that would seem surprising now, often combining sweet, savory, and spicy flavors.Pasta was considered a dish for the wealthy, taking pride of place in aristocratic banquets during the Renaissance. For example, Bartolomeo Scappi, a papal chef in the middle of the 16th century, created a third course for a banquet consisting of boiled chicken accompanied with ravioli filled with a paste made of boiled pork belly, cow udders, roast pork, Parmesan cheese, fresh cheese, sugar, herbs, spices, and raisins.Scappi’s recipe for maccheroni alla romanesca was similarly elaborate. Flour and breadcrumb dough was mixed with goat’s milk and egg yolk and flattened into a sheet, which was then cut into thin strips with a roller cutter (bussolo), to make the noodles. After being left to dry, the macaroni was boiled for half an hour, strained and covered with grated cheese, slices of butter, sugar, cinnamon and pieces of provatura, a Roman variant of mozzarella cheese. Finally, the dish baked in the oven for half an hour with a little rose water so the cheese would melt, while the macaroni was imbued with the flavor of the spices. It is no surprise that another 16th-century author, Giulio Cesare Croce, put macaroni on his list of “fattening dishes.”Pasta, by the late 17th century in Naples, was becoming the main staple of the common diet. Neapolitans had been nicknamed leaf-eaters (mangiafoglia) in the 1500s. From the 1700s they started to be called macaroni-eaters (mangiamaccheroni) instead. Several explanations have been put forward for this. One is a deterioration in the common people’s standard of living, which significantly limited their access to meat, while the large landowners in the Kingdom of Naples or Sicily sold wheat relatively cheaply. Religious restrictions also had an influence on the changing diet: Pasta was an ideal food for days when eating meat was forbidden. But perhaps the main reason for pasta’s dramatic spread was that, from the 17th century, industrial pasta production was developed with the use of machines such as the torchio, a mechanical press to make noodles or vermicelli.In Naples pasta became identified with beggars, or lazzaroni. “When a lazzarone has gotten four or five coins together to eat some macaroni that day, he ceases to care about tomorrow and stops working,” a traveler said. That did not prevent pasta from conquering the palates of the upper classes. King Ferdinand IV of Naples devoured macaroni with gusto: “He picked them up with his fingers, twisting and pulling them, and voraciously stuffed them in his mouth, spurning the use of a knife, fork or spoon.”Several things that have changed drastically over time are the flavorings added to pasta. Sweetness has been replaced by savory, sugar swapped out for vegetables, which helped make pasta a nutritionally complete dish. Then, at the beginning of the 19th century, tomatoes were added. For a long time Italians considered them to be too exotic. In fact, it is not until 1844 that the first recipe appears for the most common pasta dish today: spaghetti in tomato sauce.The Kneading Machine An operator sitting on a bar (A) moves up and down to knead the pasta (B). The process took two hours to complete.The Press The kneaded pasta is placed in a cylinder that is compressed by a screw (C).

"Shoichi Sugiyama first started making mochi when he was four years old. Growing up in Japan, his father would ring in the new year by walking him through the steps of crafting the traditional sweet treat. Now in his late 60s, Sugiyama continues the tradition, albeit thousands of miles away and with a new crowd of people.Today, Sugiyama lives in Bellevue, Washington, a city on the outskirts of Seattle. He celebrates each new year surrounded by locals and tourists on Bainbridge Island during the annual mochi tsuki—or "mochi making"—event.Mochi, a sweet, chewy rice cake, got its start in Japan hundreds of years ago as a valuable delicacy made and eaten in the first days of the new year. Mochi is associated with strength, long life, and good luck and health, so much so that it has been placed as an offering on Buddhist altars.Mochi is made with mochigome, a short-grain, glutinous type of Japonica rice. After the rice has been soaked overnight, it’s placed over a fire in a rice steaming box, called a “seiro.” These boxes are stacked on top of each other and then placed over boiling water.After about 30 to 40 minutes of steaming, the rice is put into a large mortar, called an “usu.” There, it’s pounded with a wooden mallet, called a “kine,” into a smooth, thick dough. The hot dough needs to be turned periodically and splashed with water during the process to prevent it from sticking to the kine.When ready, the dough is shaped into buns. And there you have it: mochi.Mochi can be prepared a variety of ways, but it’s commonly made into a small round ball and filled with sweet red bean paste. Sometimes, it’s also made into mochi ice cream.Today, the process of making mochi has been streamlined with machines. But in Washington, Sugiyama keeps the tradition alive, mallets and all.You can try Sugiyama’s traditional mochi at an annual festival celebrating Seattle’s Japanese-American community.This coastal paradise means you can stay in a bustling, caffeinated city, with easy access to nature's wonder. Whale watching and skiing is accessible seasonally, while the slow drip is available year round.",

"Children participate in a Christmas procession in Tbilisi, Georgia. Orthodox believers observe Christmas according to the Julian—rather than Gregorian—calendar.Christmas is over, so why are 12 percent of the world’s Christians waiting until January 7 to celebrate? Orthodox Christmas is celebrated by approximately 260 million people worldwide, both in majority-Orthodox countries in Eastern Europe, like Russia and Greece, and in communities in Ethiopia, Egypt, and elsewhere.(How Christmas has evolved over the centuries.)Marked by devout vigils and traditional feasts, the holiday traces its origins back to the centuries-old decision of Orthodox churches to split from the Catholic church and adhere to a calendar that differs from the one used by most of the world today. Here’s what you need to know.Disagreements as to when to officially recognize the birth of Jesus Christ stretch back all the way to A.D. 325, when a group of Christian bishops convened the religion’s first ecumenical conference—a gathering to rule on issues of religious doctrine.One of the First Council of Nicaea’s most important agenda items was to standardize the date of the church’s most important holiday, Easter. To do so, they decided to base it on the Julian calendar, a solar calendar which Roman ruler Julius Caesar had adopted in 46 B.C. on the advice of Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes in an attempt to clean up Rome’s own messy lunar calendar.(The new year once started in March—and January didn't exist.)But Sosigenes’ calculations had an issue of their own: They overestimated the length of the solar year by about 11 minutes. As a result, the calendar and the solar year became increasingly out of sync as the centuries progressed.By 1582, the dates of important Christian holidays had drifted so much that Pope Gregory XIII was concerned. He convened another group of astronomers and proposed a new calendar, known as the Gregorian calendar.The new calendar solved a number of tricky issues that had accumulated over the years, and the majority of the Christian world adopted it.But the Orthodox Church disagreed. During the Great Schism of 1054, it had split into its own arm of Christianity after centuries of mounting political and doctrinal difference. Orthodox Christians do not recognize the Pope as the leader of the church, reject the concept of purgatory, and disagree over the origin of the Holy Spirit, among other differences.Following Pope Gregory’s course correction would have meant accepting an occasional overlap between Passover and Easter—a move that went against holy texts of Orthodox Christianity. So the Orthodox Church rejected the Gregorian calendar and continued to rely on the Julian calendar.It stayed that way for centuries, and the calendar drift continued. By 1923, there was a 13-day difference between the two calendars, putting Orthodox Christmas 13 days after December 25.That explains the existence of two Christmases—but how did Orthodox churches address their ongoing calendar crisis? In May 1923, a group of Orthodox leaders met to hash out the issue. Held in Constantinople, the Pan-Orthodox Congress brought together delegations from the churches of Constantinople, Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Russia, and Serbia.Discussion was heated: Historian Aram Sarkisian writes that the Church of Russia had been pressured to adopt the Gregorian calendar by the Bolsheviks, who abandoned the Julian calendar shortly after the Russian Revolution began. Revising the calendar wasn’t just a matter of religion: To churches whose existence was threatened under the rule of Communism, a calendar adjustment was a matter of survival.(From tsar to U.S.S.R.: Learn more about Russia's chaotic year of revolution.)At the conference, Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković proposed a solution: a new version of the Julian calendar that shares its dates with the Gregorian calendar, though it doesn’t share every leap year. Known as the revised Julian calendar, it was adopted by several Orthodox churches, including the churches of Greece, Cyprus, and Romania. Those churches now celebrate Christmas on December 25.But other Orthodox churches, like those of Russia and Egypt, refused. And still others, like Poland, adopted Milanković’s calendar, then dropped it later. They celebrate Christmas on January 7—until 2100, that is, when it will move to January 8 as the calendar continues to drift.Today, Orthodox traditions differ depending on location, church branch, and local custom. But for many, Christmas is focused on devout religious celebrations. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians fast for up to 40 days leading up to Christmas, preparing for the birth of Christ by abstaining from meat, dairy, fish, wine, and olive oil. After a vigil on Christmas Eve, Christmas itself is celebrated as one of the Church’s 12 Great Feasts, with churchgoing and celebration at home.(How Christmas is celebrated around the world.)Other traditions are as vibrant and varied as the places they originated. In Georgia, clergy and people in religious costumes parade through the streets, singing carols and walking toward the church. Called Alilo, the procession’s name is derived from that of a song traditionally sung by children on Christmas Eve as they go from door to door, collecting money and small gifts. That custom exists in other places, too, like Romania and Greece.Food is paramount for Orthodox Christmas celebrations, and those traditions also vary by region. In Russia, for example, a wheat and rice porridge dish called kutya is eaten on Christmas Eve, often from a communal bowl symbolizing unity. The food is sometimes thrown up to the ceiling; if it sticks, tradition goes, you’ll have good luck. Egyptian Copts break their fast with a bread-rice-and-meat dish called fattah, and Ethiopian Orthodox Church members eat wat, a stew that often features chicken from a rooster that’s divided into 12 parts, symbolizing the 12 apostles, along with 12 eggs.Will calendar confusion eventually lead more Orthodox Christians to choose another date for the celebrations? Perhaps. But until then, Christmas cheer—and all that delicious food—will have to wait in January for many members of the Orthodox Church.",
"Christmas is both merry and bright—but how did it become so popular? Laden with tradition and brimming with festivity, the Christian holiday, observed in most of the world on December 25, celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem.In modern times, it has become an increasingly secularized holiday marked by a season of good cheer and festive family fun, punctuated by traditions culled from a variety of cultures. Here’s how Christmas came to be, and what’s behind some of its most cherished customs.The Christian gospels do not mention the date of Jesus’ birth, known as the Nativity. They do tell the story of his humble birth.According to the gospels, Jesus’ mother, Mary, was a virgin selected by God to bear his only son. After learning Mary was pregnant, her fiancé, a carpenter named Joseph, wanted to cancel their engagement. But an angel appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be afraid. The newlyweds then made an arduous journey to Bethlehem to participate in a mandatory census. (How the Advent season evolved as a countdown to Christmas.)The influx of visitors to Bethlehem meant that there was no lodging for the expecting couple to rent. After an innkeeper took pity on them and let them sleep in his stable, Mary gave birth to the son of God. She lay him in a manger as angels sang and a bright star began shining in the sky.Historians disagree on how December 25 became associated with Christmas. However, by A.D. 336, Christmas was celebrated by the Christian church in Rome on that day, which coincided with the Roman winter equinox festival of Saturnalia. (Here’s why some people celebrate Christmas in January.)Winter festivals had existed worldwide since ancient times, and eventually many of those festivals’ traditions became linked with Christmas. For example, the Germanic solstice festival of Yule featured banquets and celebration, and Celtic Druids held a two-day solstice festival during which they lit candles and decorated their homes with holly and mistletoe.Over time, Christmas gained popularity—and new traditions. In medieval England, Christmas was a 12-day festival involving all kinds of revelry, from plays to wild feasts to pageants celebrating Jesus’ birth. Music, gift giving, and decorations all became the norm.The most extravagant feasts were celebrated by monarchs such as Henry III, whose guests gorged themselves on 600 oxen at one 13th-century Christmas feast. Universities would crown a “Christmas King” or “King of the Beans” who “ruled” his peers during the holiday season, and even the most modest celebrations included hymns and carols.But not everyone relished the celebrations. In 1644, English Puritans banned the festival, prompting rioting and helping stoke England’s second civil war.England did not have a monopoly on Christmas. Celebrants all over the world incorporated customs from their wintertime festivals into the holiday—perhaps none more so than the Germans.Germany is credited for giving birth to one universal symbol, the Christmas tree, which evolved from the pagan tradition of decorating with tree branches. Germans called their version, an indoor pine tree adorned with candles and presents, a Tannenbaum. The tradition took flight in the 19th century, when the British royal family, who had German roots, put up a Christmas tree and started a global trend. (The surprising history of Christmas trees.)In Germany—the originator of many other traditions, such as Advent wreaths, nutcrackers, and Christmas markets—Christmas was shaped by political forces too. In the 1930s, the Nazis attempted to redefine the holiday as a non-Christian celebration of the Third Reich.Like in England, American Puritans banned Christmas, in Massachusetts in 1659, only lifting the ban in 1681. In the United States, Christmas was not celebrated with much gusto until the Civil War, which reinforced for many the importance of home and family. In 1870, after the war’s end, Congress made Christmas the nation’s first federal holiday.Meanwhile, as immigrants flooded into the U.S. in the latter half of the 19th century, they brought their own traditions with them. As Christmas historian William D. Crump writes in The Christmas Encyclopedia, this created “a kind of Christmas melting pot, with assimilation of various cultures into a more uniform and widely celebrated holiday at home with the family.”One of those cultural icons that immigrants brought with them would become a distinctly American celebrity—Santa Claus.One of the most popular figures of a modern Christmas is Santa Claus, the round-bellied, white-bearded patriarch who takes a reindeer-driven sleigh to deliver presents to good children the world over. The character is based on St. Nicholas, a third-century Greek bishop who became associated with December gift-giving. (How St. Nicholas became known as Santa Claus.)Santa came to the U.S. with German and Dutch immigrants in the 18th and 19th centuries. He was popularized in stories by American authors such as Washington Irving and Clement Clarke Moore—whose poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” is perhaps better known by its opening words, “Twas the night before Christmas.”Santa’s iconic look was propagated by illustrator Thomas Nast, who drew on European folk tales to create a Santa whose popularity soon spread around the globe. In 1890, merchant James Edgar started an indelible custom when he dressed as Santa and greeted children in the aisles of his Brockton, Massachusetts, department store. The idea took off, and Santas have frequented department stores (and more recently, malls) ever since.Light has always been a part of winter festivals, with their signature long, dark nights. Electric Christmas lights are a modern spin-off of the old-fashioned candles that Germans placed on their trees. Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb, is credited as the inventor of the first strand of lights. In 1882 his business partner, Edward H. Johnson, created the first Christmas tree illuminated with colored lights.American innovation also shaped the always popular tradition of exchanging gifts on Christmas. In the 20th century, commercial gift wrap replaced brown-paper wrapping when Rollie B. Hall, whose brother had founded Hallmark Cards, used stylized French envelope liners after running out of tissue paper at his store. Hallmark had a hand in the modern Christmas card, too, riffing on the late 19th-century’s small printed cardboard cards to create a larger one with a book-like format perfect for personalized sentiments.Gifts, cards, and decorations are all well and good, but for many, Christmas isn’t complete without their favorite foods. Gingerbread houses gained Christmas popularity in the early 19th century after the Brothers Grimm published Hansel and Gretel, in which two children are kidnapped by a witch who lives in a house with walls made of gingerbread and other sweets. From fruitcake to wassail punch, each culture has its own spin on what’s considered Christmas food. (15 Christmas dishes from around the world.)Though Christmas has religious origins, it’s become a secular—and increasingly commercialized—holiday. That’s sparked concern for centuries, says historian Lisa Jacobson. “People have complained about the excessive commercialization of Christmas ever since its [modern] incarnation in the mid-19th century,” she tells the University of California Santa Barbara’s The Current. “I don’t think that ambivalence has ever entirely disappeared.” (See how Christmas is celebrated around the world.)Those who fear the holiday has strayed from its religious roots have a point. In 2019, more than nine in ten Americans polled by Gallup said they celebrate Christmas—but just 35 percent said they saw the holiday as “strongly religious.” But with its mishmash of pagan and religious traditions, the holiday offers something—whether holy or not—for everyone who celebrates it.Editor's note: The original version of this story incorrectly used the term "immaculate conception."

"During the darkest days of winter, Christians prepare for one of their religion’s most important holidays during the season of Advent. Lasting roughly four weeks, it’s a season of candlelight, reflection, and expectation—a chance to get ready for Christmas, the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.The season’s dates vary from year to year. In 2022, Advent begins on Sunday, November 27, and ends on Saturday, December 24.Advent gets its name from adventus, the Latin word for “arrival.” As the Christian church solidified in the fifth century A.D., so did traditions around December 25. Historians have tracked the first formal Advent celebrations to northern Italy, where churchgoers observed a weeks-long preparation for Christmas that involved fasting, prayer, and reflection on Christian values.Eventually, that preparation became known as Advent. By the sixth century, Christians in France celebrated a five-week “St. Martin’s Lent” that included fasts and abstaining from sexual intercourse leading up to Christmas.Advent is now considered the first season of the liturgical year, the church’s annual cycle of feast days and Scripture readings. Much like their ancestors, modern Christians see it as a season of preparation in honor of Christ. Advent is celebrated on four consecutive Sundays, beginning on the Sunday closest to November 30 and ending on December 24, Christmas Eve.Each Sunday has a traditional meaning and prayers and readings assigned to it; they represent, in order, the Christian virtues of love, joy, hope, and peace. For believers, Advent represents a multi-faceted period during which to prepare for the birth of Christ, celebrate faith in and conversion to Christianity, and anticipate the eventual resurrection of the son of God.Considered a season of light in the dark apex of winter, Advent is symbolized in the church by a candlelit evergreen wreath. In 1838 Johann Wichern, a German Lutheran pastor, began using this wreath to help his congregation count down the days until Christmas. (The surprising history of Christmas trees—a tradition that likely also took root in Germany.)The modern Advent wreath has four candles. The first two and the fourth are purple, Advent’s traditional color. The third candle is pink, representing the halfway point of Advent and the joy of the coming holiday.Christians traditionally pray, sing, and light an additional candle on each Advent Sunday until all of the candles are lit on the fourth Sunday. A fifth, white candle known as the Christ candle sometimes sits unlit in the center of the wreath; it is only lit on Christmas Eve.Another German Advent tradition is the Advent calendar. During the 19th century, adults began helping children count down the days until Christmas. Beginning on December 1, some German Lutherans made chalk marks on doors in anticipation of the entry of the Christ child, and other parents created homemade ways to count down involving snacks and Bible verses.In 1908 German printer Gerhard Lang produced the first printed Advent calendar. In his childhood, his mother had handcrafted a calendar with cardboard doors and candy inside. Lang adapted the idea for the printing press, and his wares became extremely popular in Germany. But World War II-related shortages and Nazi Germany’s secular rebranding of Christmas almost killed off the printed Advent calendar.After the war, another German printer, Richard Sellmer, obtained permission from American occupying forces to print a 1946 Advent calendar. He used his contacts with Americans to introduce the Advent calendar in the United States, and with the help of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was photographed opening one with his grandchildren in 1953, they became increasingly popular in the U.S.Even though Advent technically begins in late November, modern Advent calendars typically start on December 1 and have small doors or boxes containing pictures, trinkets, or food like chocolate to be opened and consumed in the leadup to Christmas. Retailers have invested big in the Advent calendar game, and consumers can choose Advent calendars centered around beauty, popular characters, or even consumption.Like other Christmas traditions, Advent calendars became increasingly secularized in the 20th and 21st centuries. But its traditions remain a fun way for both kids and adults to ramp up Christmas delight during a dark, wintry month.",
"In December 1848, an illustration showed Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and their children admiring a Christmas tree. Many variations of the image began to circulate, popularizing the festive trend.Christmas trees are a strange tradition, if you think about it: Every December, people in regions around the world head to the nearest forest, chop down a tree, drag it into their homes, adorn it with lights, baubles, and tinsel—then unceremoniously drag it to the curb in January.But evergreen boughs have been essential seasonal decor since ancient times as part of pagan winter solstice celebrations. “Evergreens at midwinter festivals were traditional since the ancient world, signifying the victory of life and light over death and darkness,” writes Carole Cusack, professor of religious studies at the University of Sydney, in an email.It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when and where these pagan traditions morphed into the tradition as we know it: Several countries claim to be the birthplace of the Christmas tree, and there are competing mythologies that seek to explain what it all means. But while Christmas trees appear around the world, their origins are traced to regions with abundant evergreen forests—especially those in northern Europe. Here’s a look at how the Christmas tree evolved into a modern icon—and inspired new customs along the way.Latvia and Estonia both claim to have been home to the first Christmas tree. Latvia traces its Christmas tree traditions back to 1510, when a merchant guild called the House of the Black Heads carried a tree through the city, decorated it, and later burned it down. Meanwhile, Estonia has countered those claims, saying it has evidence of a similar festival hosted by the very same guild in its capital city Tallinn in 1441.(Related: Ancient matriarchal customs thrive on this Estonian island.)A Christmas tree towers outside St. Peter’s church in Riga, Latvia.Historians have cast doubt on both claims. Gustavs Strenga of the National Library of Latvia in Riga told the New York Times in 2016 that the guild’s festivities were likely unrelated to Christmas. But that hasn’t stopped these two countries from fighting for bragging rights—and in Riga’s Town Hall Square, a plaque commemorates the spot of the first Christmas tree.Instead, Cusack says it’s more likely that the Christmas tree as we know it was born in the Alsace region during the 16th century. (Now part of France, the region was considered German territory at the time.) Historical records indicate that a Christmas tree was raised in the Strasbourg Cathedral in 1539—and that the tradition had grown so popular throughout the region that the city of Freiburg banned felling trees for Christmas in 1554.(Related: Read the surprisingly tangled history of the origins of Santa Claus.)Folklore offers a number of different explanations for the meaning of the tree. Some suggest that it was inspired by the paradise tree, a symbol of the Garden of Eden that featured in a medieval play about Adam and Eve. Others believe the Christmas tree evolved from Christmas pyramids, wooden structures decorated with evergreen boughs and religious figures. Cusack doesn’t believe there’s any substance to those theories; instead, she says, “The Christmas tree was intended to be religiously neutral in the context of Christianity.”Still, the tradition caught on among German families and slowly evolved through the years to what we know today. Cusack says that Protestant reformer Martin Luther is often credited with being the first to put lights on the Christmas tree—with candles rather than today’s electric lights, which were invented in 1882—after a nighttime stroll through the forest with twinkling stars above. German emigrants took these traditions with them as they resettled in other countries. By the 18th century, Cusack says, Christmas trees were all over Europe.Queen Charlotte—the princess of a German duchy who married King George III in the mid-18th century—is thought to have introduced the first Christmas tree to the royal household. But it was another British queen who made Christmas trees the seasonal icon they are today.In 1848, Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert (another German transplant) captured the imaginations of royal watchers around the world when the Illustrated London News published an illustration of their family gathered around a decorated Christmas tree. Queen Victoria was a trendsetter of her time, and so the tradition took off around the world.Now, the most famous Christmas tree in London is the one that lights up Trafalgar Square each winter. This tree has a rich global history of its own: In 1947, Norway started the tradition of giving the U.K. a Christmas tree every year as a token of gratitude for its allyship during World War II, when the Norwegian government took refuge in the U.K. after the Nazi invasion.Germany’s Christmas tree tradition also likely arrived in the United States in the late 18th century, when Hessian troops joined the British to fight in the Revolutionary War. In the years that followed, German immigrants also brought the tradition to the U.S. and, over time, historian Penne Restad writes that they “became a point of fascination for other Americans.”(Related: Rockefeller, the viral stowaway Christmas tree owl, flies free.)American families adopted the Christmas tree more widely after 1850, when the Philadelphia-based magazine Godey’s Lady’s Book republished the royal family’s Christmas scene from Illustrated London News. But the magazine made a few tweaks, editing out Victoria’s crown and Albert’s royal sash to transform them into one version of an American family.Today, the lighting of two beloved U.S. Christmas trees are part of the country’s ritual for ushering in the holiday season. In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge oversaw the lighting of the first National Christmas Tree; a decade later, in 1933, New York City lit the first Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, which has since become a must-visit for tourists and New Yorkers alike each holiday season. Both trees have been illuminated every year since, save for a few years in the 1940s when they went dark due to blackout restrictions during World War II.The aroma of toasted almonds and glogg heralds the arrival of Saint Lucia to this charming river town illuminated all season long. Five million lights glitter on the buildings and on the 700 Christmas trees at Liseberg Amusement Park’s Christmas Market (Scandinavia’s largest). Choirs sing and sweethearts smooch along a two-mile Lane of Light leading to the harbor beginning in December.Christmas trees have long been a tradition in Russia. Yet the brightly decorated trees that light up the Kremlin’s Cathedral Square every December these days are not for Christmas. These are New Year’s trees, or yolka, a tradition that emerged out of a ban on Christmas trees in the wake of the Russian Revolution.In the 1920s, the newly installed Soviet government embarked on a campaign against religion—beginning with what it considered “bourgeois” traditions like Christmas. With Christmas trees and other customs forbidden, the secular regime began to encourage citizens to celebrate New Year’s instead.But by 1935, Soviet leadership had a change of heart when it came to the tree. Pavel Postyshev, a senior Soviet official, published a newspaper article suggesting that families celebrate New Year’s Day with “fir trees sparkling with multi-colored lights.” But while Christmas eventually returned to Russia in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the New Year’s tree has remained a tradition ever since.Even Antarctica has had its share of Christmas tree traditions—although there are no trees to be found in the South Pole. In 1946, crew members aboard a U.S. Navy expedition to Antarctica celebrated Christmas at sea by tying a spruce tree from Canada to their mast. More than half a century later, researchers based at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station created a Christmas tree out of scrap metal, complete with custom ornaments. Although the tradition briefly carried on—with iron workers adding new adornments each year—the National Science Foundation says the scrap-metal tree is no longer part of the Christmas celebrations at the Antarctic research station.In Greece, people once decorated Christmas boats rather than trees in honor of St. Nicholas, the country’s patron saint and protector of sailors. Not only would families place small wooden boats inside their homes to symbolize a welcome return from life at sea, but lighted boats took the place of honor in public squares of cities such as Thessaloniki.In modern days, however, the Christmas boat has been eclipsed by the Christmas tree. But such boats can still be spotted in some island communities.Since the 17th century, Scandinavian families have dedicated a feast day to plundering their Christmas trees for sweets before throwing them out. Observed on January 13, Saint Knut’s Day is named for King Canute, who ruled in the 11th century. Primarily celebrated in Sweden, the holiday is considered the 20th and last day of Christmas—unlike other countries where the Christmas period is 12 days long.To celebrate St. Knut’s Day, families hang cookies and other treats on their Christmas trees for children to raid. Once a family has finished stripping the tree of its decorations, people sing while tossing it ceremoniously out the door. (In Norway, the tree is chopped up and thrown in the fireplace instead.)St. Knut’s Day traditions have faded as Swedes have started taking down their Christmas decorations earlier, but Swedish folklorist Bengt af Klintberg told the TT news agency in 2015 that the tradition will live on in the country’s traditional poems and rhymes.Tió de Nadal, a Christmas tradition in Catalonia, waits on sale at a Christmas market in Barcelona, Spain.One tree-adjacent tradition is Catalonia’s Tió de Nadal, a hollow log with a painted face that families bring into their homes in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Children are expected to care for the Tió de Nadal by wrapping it in a blanket and leaving food and water out at night. Then on Christmas Day, they beat the log with sticks to make it defecate presents and treats from a hole in its rear end.(Related: Another Catalan tradition? Building death-defying human towers.)According to NPR, this unusual tradition may have evolved from a pagan ritual in which people set tree trunks on fire to keep warm through the winter. But why does the log have to poop out its treasures? Cusack says that may be related to the Caganer, the figure of a defecating peasant in Catalan Nativity scenes who represents “the world turned upside-down, when at certain times the poor or disenfranchised are celebrated and the lofty brought low,” Cusack explains. “The idea is that the feces fertilizes the earth; the caganer embodies civil virtues.”But the true origins of this Catalan ritual remain shrouded in mystery—and, much like other Christmas tree lore, may be lost to time.",
"A group of women give a folklore presentation to Thai tourists. Kihnu's ancient, unique culture—largely preserved by women—attracts tourists from Estonia and abroad.A four-hour ferry ride off the coast of Estonia, the sunlit conifers and coastal meadows of Kihnu Island rise gently from the Baltic Sea. You can bike from one end to the other in half an hour. Its four villages house around 700 people—only two thirds of whom live there year-round—and there is no hotel. Yet the island receives 12 times more tourists per resident than some of the most visited places in the world.A Kihnu girl celebrates the 2015 opening of a new Harbor Market. Villagers from across Kihnu come to the market to sell bread, beer, and handicrafts (the latter mostly to international visitors, as they're too expensive for most Estonians).These tens of thousands of visitors don’t come for landmarks or amusement parks. Instead, they’re here to experience the unique culture of a place often touted as Europe’s last matriarchal society.“Kihnu women have a very important role: to keep the cultural traditions,” says Mare Mätas, president of the Kihnu Cultural Space Foundation and a driving force in many community projects. “They are taking care of the human life [cycle].”Historically, Kihnu’s men left the island for weeks or months at a time, to hunt seals and fish and, later, to crew ships on international voyages. In their absence, women became the ones who tended farms, governed, and maintained traditions—traditions which have survived both time and turmoil.Over the centuries, Estonia has been invaded by Vikings, Germans, Swedes, Poles, and Russians. Its cultural survival was in question for much of the 20th century, when Soviet occupation, Nazi invasion, and Soviet reoccupation depleted the population, then pressed foreign cultural practices on those Estonians who remained. And while elements of its many invaders’ cultures became part of the country’s regional folklife, remote Kihnu has retained the vibrancy of its singular dialect, songs, dance, and weaving techniques.Tourists relax during the Mere Pidu festival, which takes place the second weekend in July. Festival games range from the universal (think tug-of-war) to the distinctly local—like contests of strength involving throwing rocks or rubber boots or carrying women.Elvi Vesik waits for a dentist appointment. Though the island now has a doctor or nurse at all times, residents must go to the mainland or wait for a visit from specialists like dentists, hairdressers, police officers, and priests.Ninety-year-old Virve Elfriede Köster is a traditional musician whose folk songs—including over 250 of her own composition—are heard worldwide.After the fall of the U.S.S.R., the island’s fishing and agriculture declined, and tourism became the main economic force—though not a positive one at first. Tourists gained a reputation as rude drunks come to take advantage of the freedom on an island without a permanent police force.“People were like wild animals [that] got loose,” says Ingvar Saare, mayor of Kihnu since his 2009 election at the age of 23. (Kihnu’s nine-member town council is usually half or majority female; Saare’s predecessor, Annely Akkerman, was later a member of parliament.)In the early 2000s, islanders’ attitude began to shift. A plan to attract cultural tourists saw quick results, providing a willing audience for folk performances as well as an income for islanders who sell handicrafts or food, or rent lodging or bicycles. By 2002, about 40 percent of Kihnu residents depended to some extent on tourism. And in 2008, Kihnu’s full recognition as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage began to entice more international visitors, especially from Japan and Germany.A girl prepares for a children's music performance during the Mere Pidu festival. Some Kihnu folk songs, particularly wedding songs, are around 2,000 years old.“When you’re on the island, you take it for granted that life is like that; you don’t see the value in the way we are living,” says Saare. “But [then] you have 30,000 tourists coming to the island every year and saying, wow, it’s great, what you’re doing here!”Some see a danger in commoditizing deeply held traditions, so closely linked to individual and collective identity, but Saare sees a way to keep the island alive.“Quite often the debate is going on that we’re just going to change into a museum, and just wear the traditional skirts for money, and so on,” he says. “But people don’t do it for money.”Though islanders own cars, and visitors can bring cars across by ferry, Kihnu's wheeled traffic is more often bikes—or Soviet-era motorcyles and sidecars popular with tourists, especially Germans interested in the machines' vintage German engineering.Life on Kihnu isn’t cheap: Most supplies have to be shipped in, and the island receives more state subsidies than most other rural villages in Estonia. Islanders tend to try to earn as much as possible from visitors during the summer, when the ferry is able to run, in order to help support their families during the deserted winters as well.But Saare and Mätas describe locals whose passion for keeping their culture alive isn’t motivated by cash for cash’s own sake. Rather, tourism money improves infrastructure and quality of life on Kihnu—hopefully convincing families to remain there. The population hasn’t recovered from the loss of families who fled in the 1940s and never returned; young men still go to Sweden, Finland, or Norway to find work in shipping or construction. Many residents only live on the island part-time: youth attend schools on the mainland, and adults often have jobs in Tallinn, the capital, or Pärnu, the closest mainland town.Kihnu only has two small apartment buildings. All other homes—including the bed-and-breakfasts where visitors stay, as there are no hotels—are traditional, Scandinavian-style wooden houses.Õie Vesik wields a traditional sickle to cut the grass in her backyard. Though agriculture has declined, small farms are still active, and there are efforts to preserve their traditional cultivation both for residents' sustenance and for tourists' interest.“We have lots of problems because if the young families leave for economic reasons … we won’t have children anymore in our school in the future,” says Mätas, describing the issue as her “biggest problem.”Efforts have even been made to build more modern houses for mainland families to move into and see if they want to join the community. “It’s one option, and we must try everything,” Mätas says, though there are also fears that the island would become an empty collection of summer houses for wealthy Estonians if local families continue to move away.Tourism may seem like a magic bullet: its job opportunities give islanders financial reason to stay, and its focus on culture as the main attraction supports the community’s ability to keep those traditions alive and thriving. But unchecked growth may have negative downstream consequences. Kihnu has less than 300 places for tourists to stay, B&B-style; more development would compromise both villages and the environment, swinging the island out of its current precarious equilibrium.For now, though, tourists are more than welcome.“Thank God people like to visit islands,” Saare says. “Thank God we are an island.”Two ferries connect Kihnu to the mainland; this one, which links to Pärnu, the closest mainland town, runs twice a day throughout the year and four times a day during the summer tourist season. Before a new ferry launched in 2015, it wasn't uncommon for poor weather to trap visitors on the island for days or weeks.From June to August, weather permitting, Kihnu’s highly anticipated new ferry makes the one-hour trip four times a day between the mainland and Kihnu (though a 15-minute flight can land on Kihnu, if you’re prone to seasickness), making it a four-hour trip all told from Tallinn. Mätas recommends checking the calendar of cultural events to plan a trip around a festival or performance—and plan it well in advance, as limited lodging capacity goes quickly when mainland Estonians take their own vacations.Winter trips are theoretically possible, for the brave: Only about five lodgings are available past September, when it gets dark at 4 p.m. and the sea ice shuts down the ferry.The nature of island life includes temperamental transportation and occasional shortages, but with a bit of pre-planning, a trip to Kihnu is plenty rewarding for those looking for a charming, quiet atmosphere, beautiful nature, and fascinating culture.“If people just want to be in the modern hotel and go to the lobby bar, this kind of thing we don’t have here,” says Mätas. “Come if you’re interested in folk culture ... [people] just want to be in the middle of nature and have that small island feeling, the light and the quiet.”A view from Kihnu's 153-year-old lighthouse, a main tourist attraction, overlooks the island's southern shores. "We can’t understand how it’s possible to live in a town," says Mätas. "It’s very different, comparing the culture on the mainland, how other people behave and think, so you’re always homesick."",
"The “E” in Estonia might as well stand for electronic. Smallest of the three Baltic states, this country, centered on its capital, Tallinn, is a global leader in digital innovation that unites people. It’s the first nation to declare Internet access a basic human right, first to accept digital signatures for most transactions, first to institute online voting, and, this year, one of the first nations with crazy-fast 5G network capability.

"Santa Claus wasn't always "chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf."Any kid can tell you where Santa Claus is from—the North Pole. But his historical journey is even longer and more fantastic than his annual, one-night circumnavigation of the globe.The progenitor of the modern American Santa was born in the Mediterranean during the Roman Empire, his legend evolved across northern Europe, and he finally assumed his now-familiar form on the shores of the New World. Who is this ancestor of Santa, and how did he change over time? (See "Christmas in July—Inside a Santa Summer Camp.")In this photo from a January 1957 National Geographic article, Alaskan reindeer pull Santa Claus's sleigh during the Pageant of Peace in Washington, D.C. The annual event, which includes the lighting of the National Christmas Tree, began in 1923 under President Calvin Coolidge.The Santa we know today bears little resemblance to the original Saint Nicholas. Yet the character has proved an enduring icon of Christmas. For many people around the world, the jolly, red-suited, white-bearded figure is a central part of the holiday's celebration—and commercialization.As you wait for Santa to come down your chimney tonight, browse through these images of Old Saint Nick from the National Geographic photo archive.—By Anna Lukacs, photo gallery by Kathy MoranEvery December 6, the faithful celebrate St. Nicholas Day in cities all over the world, with the largest ones taking place in Europe. Images of St. Nicholas vary considerably, but none of them look much like the red-cheeked, white-bearded old man seen everywhere today. One of the most compelling views of the real St. Nick, who lived in the third and fourth centuries, was created not by ancient artists but by using modern forensic facial reconstruction.Scholarly debate over where the remains of the Greek bishop rest continues to this day, but traditionally, it was believed that the bones of St. Nicholas were stolen by Italian sailors during the 11th century and taken to the crypt of the Basilica di San Nicola on the southeast coast of Italy. When the crypt was repaired in the 1950s, the saint's skull and bones were documented with x-ray photos and thousands of detailed measurements. (For theories on other possible resting places of St. Nicholas, read: "Could the Remains of Santa Claus Be in This Turkish Church?")Caroline Wilkinson, a facial anthropologist at the University of Manchester (England), used these data and modern software simulations to create a modern reconstruction of the long-dead man. Wilkinson put a human face on Santa's original namesake—one with a badly broken nose, possibly suffered during the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian.The Basilica of Saint Nicholas in Bari, Italy, was built in the 11th century. Many believe that it houses the mortal remains and holy relics of St. Nicholas.Much of her work is necessarily subject to interpretation. The size and shape of the facial muscles that once covered Nicholas's skull had to be inferred, and the shape of that skull itself was recreated from two-dimensional data. Digital artists added details that were based on best guesses, including the olive-toned skin most common among Greek Mediterraneans like Nicholas, brown eyes, and the gray hair of a 60-year-old man."We are bound to have lost some of the level of detail you would get by working from photographs, but we believe this is the closest we are ever going to get to him," Wilkinson said in the BBC Two feature film of the project entitled The Real Face of Santa.How did this St. Nicholas turn into the North Pole-dwelling bringer of Christmas gifts? The original saint was a Greek born in the late third century, around 280 A.D. He became bishop of Myra, a small Roman town in modern Turkey. Nicholas was neither fat nor jolly but developed a reputation as a fiery, wiry, and defiant defender of church doctrine during the Great Persecution in 303, when Bibles were burned and priests made to renounce Christianity or face execution.Nicholas defied these edicts and spent years in prison before the Roman emperor Constantine ended Christian persecution in 313 with the Edict of Milan. Nicholas's fame lived long after his death (on December 6 in the mid-fourth century, around 343) because he was associated with many miracles, and reverence for him continues to this day independent of his Christmas connection. He is the protector of many types of people, from orphans to sailors to prisoners.A religious icon representing St. Nicholas.Nicholas rose to prominence among the saints because he was the patron of so many groups. By about 1200, explained University of Manitoba historian Gerry Bowler, author of Santa Claus: A Biography, he became known as a patron of children and magical gift bringer because of two great stories from his life.In the better-known tale, three young girls are saved from a life of prostitution when young Bishop Nicholas secretly delivers three bags of gold to their indebted father, which can be used for their dowries."The other story is not so well known now but was enormously well known in the Middle Ages," Bowler said. Nicholas entered an inn whose keeper had just murdered three boys and pickled their dismembered bodies in basement barrels. The bishop not only sensed the crime, but resurrected the victims as well. "That's one of the things that made him the patron saint of children."For several hundred years, circa 1200 to 1500, St. Nicholas was the unchallenged bringer of gifts and the toast of celebrations centered around his feast day, December 6. The strict saint took on some aspects of earlier European deities, like the Roman Saturn or the Norse Odin, who appeared as white-bearded men and had magical powers like flight. He also ensured that kids toed the line by saying their prayers and practicing good behavior.But after the Protestant Reformation began in the 1500s, saints like Nicholas fell out of favor across much of northern Europe. "That was problematic," Bowler said. "You still love your kids, but now who is going to bring them the gifts?"Bowler said that, in many cases, that job fell to baby Jesus, and the date was moved to Christmas rather than December 6. "But the infant's carrying capacity is very limited, and he's not very scary either," Bowler said. "So the Christ child was often given a scary helper to do the lugging of presents and the threatening of kids that doesn't seem appropriate coming from the baby Jesus."Some of these scary Germanic figures again were based on Nicholas, no longer as a saint but as a threatening sidekick like Ru-klaus (Rough Nicholas), Aschenklas (Ashy Nicholas), and Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas). These figures expected good behavior or forced children to suffer consequences like whippings or kidnappings. Dissimilar as they seem to the jolly man in red, these colorful characters would later figure in the development of Santa himself. (Related: "Who Is Krampus? Explaining the Horrific Christmas Devil.")In the Netherlands, kids and families simply refused to give up St. Nicholas as a gift bringer. They brought Sinterklaas with them to New World colonies, where the legends of the shaggy and scary Germanic gift bringers also endured.But in early America Christmas wasn't much like the modern holiday. The holiday was shunned in New England, and elsewhere it had become a bit like the pagan Saturnalia that once occupied its place on the calendar. "'It was celebrated as a kind of outdoor, alcohol-fueled, rowdy community blowout," Bowler said. "That's what it had become in England as well. And there was no particular, magical gift bringer."Then, during the early decades of the 19th century, all that changed thanks to a series of poets and writers who strove to make Christmas a family celebration—by reviving and remaking St. Nicholas.Washington Irving's 1809 book Knickerbocker's History of New York first portrayed a pipe-smoking Nicholas soaring over the rooftops in a flying wagon, delivering presents to good girls and boys and switches to bad ones.In 1821 an anonymous illustrated poem entitled "The Children's Friend" went much further in shaping the modern Santa and associating him with Christmas. "Here we finally have the appearance of a Santa Claus," Bowler said. "They've taken the magical gift-bringing of St. Nicholas, stripped him of any religious characteristics, and dressed this Santa in the furs of those shaggy Germanic gift bringers."That figure brought gifts to good girls and boys, but he also sported a birch rod, the poem noted, that "directs a Parent's hand to use when virtue's path his sons refuse." Santa's thin wagon was pulled by a single reindeer—but both driver and team would get a major makeover the next year.In 1822 Clement Clarke Moore wrote "A Visit From St. Nicholas," better known today as "The Night Before Christmas," for his six children, with no intention of adding to the fledgling Santa Claus phenomenon. It was published anonymously the next year, and to this day the plump, jolly Santa described therein rides a sleigh driven by eight familiar reindeer."It went viral," Bowler said. But familiar as the poem is, it still leaves much to the imagination, and the 19th century saw Santa appear in different-colored clothing, in sizes from miniature to massive, and in a variety of different guises. "I have a wonderful picture of him that looks exactly like George Washington riding a broomstick," Bowler said.It wasn't until the late 19th century, he added, that the image of Santa became standardized as a full-size adult, dressed in red with white fur trim, venturing out from the North Pole in a reindeer-driven sleigh and keeping an eye on children's behavior.The jolly, chubby, grandfatherly face of this Santa was largely created by Thomas Nast, the great political cartoonist in an era that featured many. "However, Nast did leave him half-sized," Bowler added, "and in what I think are rather indecent long johns."Once firmly established, North America's Santa then underwent a kind of reverse migration to Europe, replacing the scary gift bringers and adopting local names like Père Noël (France) or Father Christmas (Great Britain). "What he's done is pretty much tame these Grimm's Fairy Tales-type characters from the late medieval days," Bowler said.Though he undoubtedly means well, Santa has certainly stirred up, and continues to create, more than his fair share of controversy.In Russia, Santa Claus fell afoul of Josef Stalin. Before the Russian Revolution, Grandfather Frost (Ded Moroz) was a favored figure of Christmas who had adopted characteristics of proto-Santas like the Dutch Sinterklaas. "When the Soviet Union was formed, the communists abolished the celebration of Christmas and gift bringers," Bowler said."Then in the 1930s, when Stalin needed to build support, he allowed the reemergence of Grandfather Frost not as a Christmas gift bringer but as a New Year's gift bringer," Bowler added. Attempts to displace Christmas in Russia were ultimately unsuccessful, as were Soviet attempts to spread a secular version of Grandfather Frost, complete with blue coat to avoid Santa confusion, across Europe."Everywhere they went after World War II, the Soviets tried to replace the native gift bringers in places like Poland or Bulgaria," Bowler explained. "But local people just sort of held their noses until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 and returned to their own traditions."Santa remains a politicized figure around the world. American troops spread their version of the jolly man around the world in the years immediately following World War II, and he was generally welcomed, Bowler said, as a symbol of American generosity in rebuilding war-ravaged lands.Nowadays, however, people in many nations have Santa on their own naughty list, either because he represents the secular side of Christmas at the expense of the religious. Sometimes Santa is rejected because he's not a local. "In places like the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, and Latin America, they all have very strong anti-Santa movements because they are trying to preserve their native Christmas gift bringers and customs, and protect them from the North American Santa," he said.Such efforts seem unlikely to stop a growing interest in Santa Claus, but their organizers may save him a few stops on his busy Christmas Eve schedule.",
"Some say that the beginnings of the Reformation can be traced back to a thunderstorm in 1505. After surviving the tempest, a promising law student at the University of Erfurt in Germany changed the course of his life. The young scholar’s name was Martin Luther, and the foul weather set him on a collision course with Rome and would trigger a crisis of faith in Western Christianity.“Portrait of Martin Luther as a Young Man” by Lucas Cranach the Elder depicts the Protestant founder as a simple, sincere monk.Luther came from a well-heeled family in the central region of Saxony. Luther was born in Eisleben in November 1483. Shortly after his birth, the family moved about 10 miles away to the town of Mansfeld. A successful businessman in copper mining and refining, his father, Hans, had young Martin educated at a local Latin school and later at schools in Magdeburg and Eisenach. In 1501, at age 19, he enrolled in the University of Erfurt to continue his studies.In 1505 he was returning to Erfurt after visiting his parents when a violent thunderstorm arose with raging winds and driving rain. “[I was] besieged by the terror and agony of sudden death,” the young Luther later recalled. In his panic he made a terror-stricken vow to St. Anne. He would join a religious order, he promised, if only she would save his life.Biographies of the founder of the Protestant Reformation point out that a deep sense of religious turmoil probably shaped Luther’s thoughts long before the storm. Even so, following his safe deliverance from the tempest, Luther kept his promise and, to the dismay of his father, abandoned his legal education to join the strictly observant Augustinian monastery in Erfurt. It was a decisive, stubborn act, mixed with a deep sense of religious vocation—an attitude he would display for the rest of his remarkable and turbulent life.The engraving above shows Martin Luther writing his protest on the door of Wittenberg’s All Saints’ Church. It is from a 1518 German broadside marking the first anniversary of the Ninety-Five Theses. By then, the image of Luther publicly attacking papal corruption had become a potent 16th-century meme.During his first years at the monastery, Luther did not seem to be especially subversive. He quickly made a name for himself not only with his brilliance as a theologian but also with his meticulous observance of the harsh rules governing life in the monastery; he fasted, prayed, and confessed. Content with just a table and chair in his unheated room, he would rise in the early morning hours to pray matins and lauds. By the fall of 1506 he had gained full admission to the order.Luther continued his theological education after becoming a monk. In 1507 he was ordained by the Bishop of Brandenburg. In 1508 he taught theology at the newly founded University of Wittenberg, where he also received two bachelor degrees.In 1510 Luther’s studies were interrupted by a political crisis that engulfed the Augustinians. The current pope, Julius II, had decided to merge two opposed branches (the observant and nonobservant) of the order, a plan that horrified Luther’s strictly observant monastery. Luther was chosen by his superiors to defend the views of their monastery before the general Augustinian council in Rome.In late 1510 Luther made his first—and last—visit to Rome. During his stay, the friar followed traditional pilgrimage customs. Among other observances, he climbed the steps of the St. John Lateran Basilica on his knees, reciting the Lord’s Prayer on each step. It is said that during his ascent he was perplexed to find the words of the Apostle Paul coming back to him: “the righteous shall live by faith,” a tenet that would form a central part of his later doctrine. During his stay, Luther found himself unsettled by the corruption and lack of spirituality he saw in Rome. He saw openly corrupt priests who sneered at the rituals of their faith. He later described his visit: “Rome is a harlot . . . The Italians mocked us for being pious monks, for they hold Christians fools. They say six or seven masses in the time it takes me to say one, for they take money for it and I do not.”After returning to Germany, Luther earned his doctorate in 1512. As a professor, he taught several classes at the University of Wittenberg. The spiritual hollowness he had seen in Rome did not break his faith with the church, but scholars believe it continued to disquiet him.That Martin Luther’s Ninety-Five Theses helped launch the Reformation is beyond question. Dated October 31, 1517, Luther’s letter to his superiors did include copies of the theses. But did he actually nail them to the door of Wittenberg’s All Saints’ Church? The historical consensus is . . . probably not. Luther himself never mentioned having done so. At the time, he had no idea his theses would create such a stir and would not have seen the need to carry out such a provocative act. Nevertheless, the legend arose and gained traction.The spark that ignited Luther’s confrontation with Rome was the sale of “indulgences,” which would lessen the impact of, or pardon, a person from their sins. In theory, indulgences were granted by the church on the condition that the recipient carried out some kind of good work or other specified acts of contrition. In practice, indulgences could be bought. The practice was abused by the church, which began relying upon their sale as a way of raising money, especially to pay for costly building projects.Cameo of Leo X, pope at the time of Luther’s 1517 revolt.Rome in the early 1500s was under the spell of the artistic projects of the Renaissance. Around 1515, Pope Leo X published a new indulgence in a bid to fund the reconstruction of the Basilica of St. Peter in Rome, entrusting Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, with promoting its sale in Germany.Enraged, Luther took a stand against the papal actions. On October 31, 1517, he composed his Disputation on the Power of Indulgences, better known as the Ninety-Five Theses. According to tradition, he nailed these to the door of All Saints’ Church, Wittenberg, although modern historians are somewhat skeptical that such a lengthy document could be posted in this way. Regardless of how the Ninety-Five Theses were distributed, many found Luther’s arguments explosive. He argued that the practice of relying on indulgences drew believers away from the one true source of salvation: faith in Christ. God alone had the power to pardon the repentant faithful. The pontifical council ordered him to retract his claims immediately, but Luther refused.Luther’s reformation was not born in a vacuum, and his fate rested as much on the turbulent politics of the day as it did on pure questions of theology. Wittenberg was part of Saxony, a state of the Holy Roman Empire, a patchwork of territories in central Europe with roots deep in the medieval past. The Holy Roman Emperor was appointed by the heads of its main states, influential rulers known as electors.At the time that Luther wrote his theses, the elector of Saxony was Frederick the Wise. A humanist and a scholar, Frederick had founded the new university at Wittenberg that Luther attended. Frederick’s response to Luther’s theological challenge was complex. He never stopped being a Catholic, but he decided from the outset to protect the rebel friar both from the fury of the church and the Holy Roman Emperor. When in 1518 Luther was summoned to Rome, Frederick intervened on his behalf, ensuring that he would be questioned in Germany, a much safer place for him than Rome. The church was forced to respect Elector Frederick’s wishes because he would be instrumental in choosing the replacement to the ailing Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I.Letters of indulgence, like this one granted in 1512, sparked Luther’s revolt in 1517.Safe under the wing of Frederick, Luther began to engage in regular public debate on religious reforms. He broadened his arguments, declaring that any church council or even a single believer had the right to challenge the pope, so long as they based their arguments on the Bible. He even dared to argue that the church did not rest on papal foundations but rather on faith in Christ.Luther must have realized early on that his reform movement had a political dimension. In 1520 he wrote a treatise, “Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation.” It argued that all Christians could be priests from the moment of their baptism, that anyone reading the Scripture with faith had the right to interpret it, and that every believer had the right to assemble a free council. This declaration was revolutionary for the ecclesiastic hierarchy of the time.This 15th-century print by Diebold Schilling the Elder depicts the burning of Czech reformist Jan Hus in 1415.Luther was not the first person to confront the Catholic Church. Writing in the 1370s and ‘80s, Oxford scholar John Wycliffe denounced the wealth of the church, called for a greater emphasis on scripture, and oversaw an English biblical translation. The church condemned Wycliffe, but Oxford University shielded him from arrest. In the 1400s Jan Hus, a scholar at the University of Prague, was exposed to Wycliffe’s works. Hus too believed that scripture was greater than tradition and preached in his native language, Czech. His writings led him to leave Prague for fear of reprisals, but Hus was later arrested in 1414, charged with heresy, and burned at the stake in 1415. Following his death, his followers continued the fight, forming the Hussite movement which spread through what is today the Czech Republic.In January 1521 a papal decree was published under which Luther was declared a heretic and excommunicated. Under normal circumstances, this sentence would have meant a trial and, most likely, execution. But these were no ordinary times. Both Frederick and widespread German public opinion demanded that Luther be given a proper hearing. The newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, finally acquiesced and called Luther to come before the Imperial Diet (assembly) to be held that spring in the ancient Rhineland city of Worms.On his journey to Worms Luther was acclaimed almost as a messiah by the citizens of the towns he passed through. On his arrival in Worms in April 1521, crowds gathered to see the man who embodied the struggle against the seemingly all-powerful Catholic Church. Once inside the episcopal palace, Luther was met by young Charles V, princes, imperial electors, and other dignitaries. When charged, Luther said that he stood by every one of his published claims.The Archbishop of Trier urged him to retract his theses, and Luther asked for time for consideration. After a night of reflection, he remained steadfast. His writings, he maintained, were based on Scripture; on his conscience, he declared he could not recant anything “for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe.” He is said to have concluded with the famous words in German: “Hier stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders—Here I stand, I can do no other.”Luther’s revolt inspired other religious leaders in cities outside Germany such as Strasbourg, Geneva, Basel, and Lucca. In Zürich Huldrych Zwingli, a Swiss leader of the Reformation, persuaded the city council and a large part of the population to accept a full program for the strict observance of the Gospel. Priestly celibacy was abolished. Baptism and the Eucharist were still celebrated as sacraments, but the belief that during the Mass the bread and wine actually turned into the body and blood of Christ was abandoned. In Zwingli’s view, the Eucharist became a symbolic rite in remembrance of Christ’s sacrifice. Sacred music was prohibited, and paintings in churches were destroyed. An army of preachers was chosen to go out into the city and foment this radical new teaching.Luther left Worms unbowed, but his life was in peril. Charles V signed an edict naming him and his followers political outlaws and demanded their writings be burned. Seized by his protector, Frederick, Luther was granted sanctuary in the castle of Wartburg until the situation evolved and the danger passed.Outlawed for having defended his ideas at the Diet of Worms in 1521, Luther took refuge here in Wartburg Castle, under the protection of Frederick the Wise of Saxony. In this medieval fortress, Luther made his translation of the New Testament into German.Despite his absence, Luther’s words and writings were spreading like wildfire throughout Germany, thanks in part to the printing revolution. Luther’s declarations at Worms sparked a revolutionary spirit that had been smoldering among the German people, many of who were tired of seeing their earnings gobbled up by the church. Supported by their rulers, also eyeing the opportunity of greater freedom from Rome, a host of reformers came forward in support of Lutheran principles.Some, to Luther’s dismay, went very much further. Just after Christmas, in 1521, the so-called Zwickau prophets foretold the imminent return of Christ. They wanted to tear down and destroy all religious images, statues, and altarpieces. They even proposed radical changes to the sacraments, the most dramatic of which was their rejection of the rite of baptism for children and a demand that adults be rebaptized. It was from this element that Anabaptism—from the Latin anabaptista, meaning “one who baptizes over again”—grew. Despite savage repression, Anabaptism periodically flared up during the following years.Another serious threat to the established order was the struggle unleashed by the peasants in 1524 and 1525. The ideas of equality and social justice inherent in Luther’s reform were seized upon by a rural society hungry for change. A revolt erupted across huge swaths of Germany.Luther may have been a theological radical, but he was not a social reformer. On hearing news of these movements, he voiced his opposition. Having left Wartburg Castle in 1522, he upbraided all Christians who were taking part in insurrections against authority. In an essay entitled “Against the Murderous and Robbing Hordes of the Peasants” (1525), he condemned the peasant violence as work of the devil. He called out for the nobility to track down the rebels like they would rabid dogs as, “nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful and devilish than a rebel.” Without Luther’s backing, the radical revolution was dealt a death blow. In May 1525 the peasants were defeated in Frankenhausen, and their leader was executed.Rebuilt in the early 1500s on the site of an earlier church, All Saints Church in Wittenberg, Germany, is where Martin Luther was laid to rest in 1546.When the Holy Roman Empire attempted to harden its line against Lutheranism and the wider reform movement at the Diet of Speyer in 1529, the pro-reform German princes dissented, or “protested.” Luther spent the rest of his life consolidating this new “Protestant” movement, whose tenets were spreading across Europe to Strasbourg, Zürich, Geneva, and Basel.Luther’s efforts created a great rift in Western Christianity and dominated European politics for several centuries as western Europe split into a largely Catholic south and a Protestant north. France straddled the fault line, and for much of the later 16th century was engulfed by religious conflict. The Lutheran doctrine, combined with Tudor power politics, led to England’s ultimate break from Rome in 1534. Years of Catholic-Protestant tensions in England prompted the Pilgrims to embark for the New World in the Mayflower, and laid the foundations for the English Civil War—events that stemmed from the actions of an obscure monk, on an October day exactly five hundred years ago.Historian and author Josep Palau Orta is a specialist in religion in 16th-century Europe.",
"Ellen Kalish, owner of Ravensbeard Wildlife Center, prepares to release Rockefeller the owl. Rockefeller was found dehydrated but uninjured, and was ready for release after six days of rehabilitation.A tiny owl became a supersize symbol of resilience this week after surviving a road trip inside a huge Christmas tree destined for New York City. Today, she flew free.The seven-inch-tall northern saw-whet, one of North America’s tiniest owl species, was found nestled inside the base of a 75-foot-tall spruce tree that had been chopped down in upstate New York and transported by truck to midtown Manhattan’s Rockefeller Plaza, to be erected as its annual iconic Christmas tree.The hardy bird was released into a wooded area in Upstate New York today at dusk—when owls are most active—following several days of treatment at Ravensbeard Wildlife Center.“I always get choked up when I release birds because it’s such a labor of love. It’s beautiful and it’s what we live for—all the rehabbers—seeing them go back to the wild,” says wildlife rehabilitator Ellen Kalish, who runs Ravensbeard from her home in Saugerties, New York.When Kalish got a call about the owl on Wednesday, she “almost dropped the phone.” The caller said that her husband, one of the Christmas tree crew members, had just discovered the little owl while the team was preparing to raise the tree in Rockefeller Plaza; the owl rescuer scooped her up, worried that she’d been stuck inside for days and was possibly injured. When Kalish retrieved the owl, she was standing upright in a cardboard box, looking straight at her. “I thought, this is a miracle! How did this bird survive this trip?”She named the owl Rockefeller, or “Rocky.”“She was dehydrated and super hungry,” she says, estimating that she probably had not been able to eat or drink for at least a few days. She immediately gave her water and food—a few frozen mice—which she devoured quickly. A veterinarian examined her, and x-rays showed that she had no broken bones or internal damage. By Thursday, Rocky started to bathe herself—a sign she was feeling good. (An owl bath, Kalish says, leads to “water everywhere.”)While most migratory birds are hardy, Kalish says that, in her 20 years of rehabilitating birds, she’s found that owls can be fragile.“They’re predators. They’re used to being on the offensive. And when they’re in danger or sick, they just really don’t do well.” For Rocky to bounce back so quickly—and be so animated—after such an ordeal was heartening, she says.Once Kalish knew Rocky was doing well, she decided to share her saga on her Facebook page. “It was such a special story, and everyone needs to smile these days. It was too good to keep to myself,” she says. The story went viral: overjoyed comments started flooding in, and she started fielding calls from media outlets all over the U.S. She responded to these with the help of her family while caring for Rocky and several other birds she’s rehabilitating at home, including a wood duck, four pigeons, and a Harris’s hawk.Rocky, a northern saw-whet owl, recovers at Ravensbeard Wildlife Center. She was discovered inside a 72-foot tall Christmas tree that had been transported from upstate New York to Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza.While Rocky is irresistibly cute, Kalish doesn’t want people to get the wrong idea. “We have to remember that these are apex predators. They are prickly. They aren’t soft and fuzzy. It’s actually the smallest birds that make me bleed the most.”The tree that Rocky was found in, donated by Daddy Al’s General Store in Oneonta, New York, was cut down on November 12, after days of being under police protection to ensure no one vandalized it. It was hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck and driven 200 miles to Manhattan.It’s unclear when Rocky entered the tree—whether she roosted in it after it had been chopped down or was already there. Kalish thinks it was likely the latter, and she just never made it out. “She could have been hiding in a tree cavity or had head trauma and held onto a branch and didn’t move. She may have been in shock.”Kalish says the tree crew felt distressed about the stowaway, because they had checked the tree carefully to make sure nothing was hiding inside. But saw-whet owls are tiny and well camouflaged, she says. “It’s easy to miss animals, especially when they’re nocturnal and not meant to be seen.”On Friday, Kalish moved Rocky to an outdoor practice cage so she could acclimate and Kalish could monitor her flight. By Tuesday at dusk, she seemed ready to go. Kalish brought Rocky to a clearing of nearby conifer forest, removed her from her carrier and raised her toward the sky. Rocky sat perched on Kalish’s hand for several moments, surveying her surroundings. Then, she flew off, settling in a nearby pine tree.Rocky the owl perches in a pine tree in a conifer forest in upstate New York shortly after being released back into the wild on November 24.Some people, including Oneonta residents, had previously left comments on Facebook asking why the owl wasn’t going to be released in Oneonta, where the tree was cut down. Kalish says that because saw-whet owls are nomadic, they aren’t tied to a particular habitat. “They don’t have a favorite tree. They exhaust the food source and move on.”Unlike other birds of prey, which Kalish tries to release where they were found, saw-whet owls don’t mate for life; they find a new mate every season. After consulting with several experts, she says “it didn’t seem worth the stress to take [her] for a car ride,” she says.Jason Ward, an avid birder and director of diversity at the American Bird Conservancy, agrees. Even at 2.9 ounces, he says, saw-whets “are some of most hardy and resourceful birds out there. I once read about a saw-whet being seen 70 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean. It landed on a fishing vessel.”Kalish hopes Rocky’s improbable story can shed light on the work that wildlife rehabilitators do all over the country every single day. She encourages those who are inspired by Rocky’s story to support the work of local wildlife rehabilitators in their own area.If you’re planning to chop down or buy your own Christmas tree and are concerned about a bird being trapped inside—don’t be.Chal Lundgren, a Christmas tree specialist in Oregon State University’s forestry department, says that while Christmas tree growers occasionally find abandoned birds’ nests in trees, in the 30 years he’s been operating his Christmas tree farm in Oregon he’s never found a live bird.There are rules in Oregon and Washington State requiring all trees being exported to hot places, like Hawaii, to be shaken for 15 seconds, at a precise speed, to cast off dead needles, yellowjacket nests, and slugs.“This is a very one-off experience,” as far as Christmas trees go. “Unless you’re taking down a 75-footer,” he says, your tree will likely be owl-free.As Rocky settles back into the wild where she belongs, her former home—the Rockefeller Square Christmas tree—will be lit up in a five-mile-long strand of twinkling lights on December 2.",
"Visitors take a stroll through VanDusen Botanical Garden’s Festival of Lights, where more than a million lights can be seen over 15 acres. Every winter thousands gather to see competing neighborhoods, small towns, and sprawling cities shine with festive lights and decorations.Around the holidays, millions of sparkling lights illuminate cities worldwide, with decorations growing more elaborate each year. In the U.S., an estimated 150 million sets are sold each year. Recently, string-light sales have spiked (they were up 201 percent in November 2020 from the year before).But the holidays weren’t always so bright. Before there were electric lights, candles lit the way for the holiday season. During the 17th century, German families would attach lit candles to their Christmas trees to illuminate their handcrafted decorations. Despite being a fire hazard, this practice quickly spread across Europe and later into the United States.The custom remained mostly the same until 1882, when Edward Johnson, a friend and colleague of Thomas Edison, saw a festive use for the light bulb Edison invented three years prior. He hand-wired 80 red, white, and blue lights together and wound them around a Christmas tree in his home in New York.(Learn more about the surprising history of Christmas trees.)Spectators flocked to see the flashy display, but the practice didn’t immediately catch on. Electricity was widely mistrusted, and seasonal lights were too expensive to mark them as a holiday tradition. The practice became popular among wealthy families, when President Grover Cleveland used electric lights to decorate the White House family Christmas tree in 1895. Dozens of department stores used Christmas lights to liven up their holiday displays to attract customers. Still, in 1900, a pre-made string of lights cost $12 (about $397 today), making them impractical to the average American.It wasn’t until the 1920s that these glittering decorations became a symbol of Christmas for the masses. Several manufacturing companies merged to form the National Outfit Manufacturers Association, creating affordable sets that would dominate the seasonal light market for decades. President Calvin Coolidge cemented the use of holiday lights at Christmas with the first lighting of the National Christmas tree—glowing with 3,000 electric lights—in 1923. By the 1930s, a string of lights cost $1.75 (about $29 today), swiftly turning them into a world phenomenon.(See the electric and eclectic ways Americans decorate for Christmas.)From twinkling bulbs set to festive music in Hong Kong to an explosion of illuminating color in Colombia, here are 10 places to deck the halls this holiday season.This story was originally published in November 2011 and updated December 2018 and 2021 to reflect new information.",
"Jesse Rieser describes himself as a “student of subtleties.” So it’s pretty ironic that the Phoenix-based photographer has spent nearly a decade mining the exultant spasm of American Christmas decorations, and the messages they telegraph about their surrounding communities.Before the early morning starter’s pistol, participants in the 2012 Las Vegas “Great Santa Run”—who all wear St. Nick costumes—are entertained by the Las Vegas dance troop The Jabbawockeez. The Great Santa Run is a 5K fundraiser for the Opportunity Village, an organization that supports men and women with developmental disabilities. The event regularly breaks the Guiness Book World Record for most Santas gathered in one place.Rieser has toured 18 states looking for intriguing and visually arresting holiday ornaments and displays, both routinely electric and humanly eclectic. They’re a part of his project entitled, “Christmas in America: Happy Birthday, Jesus,” which Rieser hopes to turn into a photo book.“I kind of look for images and moments that have a subtlety to them, but also a curiosity that’s not super apparent, something that always makes you ask more questions about what you’re seeing,” he says.La La’s Little Nugget Bar in Austin, Texas is well-known for its vivid, year-round Christmas decorations.After the 2012 Great Santa 5-K Run in Las Vegas, a lone Santa unwinds by playing pool at Stoney’s Rockin Country Bar as he waits for the race after party to begin.Two bar patrons dressed as Jesus Christ and Cindy Lou Who enjoy some brews while exchanging phone numbers during the 2016 “Santarchy” pub-crawl in Scottsdale, Arizona.Reiser’s search for the most compelling Christmas images stem from a single moment, after his parents left his childhood home in Springfield, Missouri and settled in Los Angeles in 2009. During his first Christmas outside of the Midwest, Rieser was driving past a tree lot when he saw a 4-story inflatable Santa Claus blowing in the wind. He couldn’t decide if it was waving goodbye or hello. The image gifted him with a “new set of optics” about the holiday season.“Growing up in the Midwest, we have this Charles Dickens-y kind of view of what Christmas looks like,” Rieser explains. “Being out West made me want to expand on what the holiday means for a broader range of people, and how they choose to express those sentiments to others.”Rieser’s lens captures an extraordinary range of decorative and human expression, from the Tempe, Arizona home festooned with dozens of inflatable Santas to the electrified Moses parting the Red Sea on an Austin front lawn. His project is the latest entry in the annals of winter revelry archives, marking a modern tradition of branches, baubles and bangles that dates back to 16th century Germany.However, the roots of the Christmas ritual actually extend back as far as the ancient Egyptian era, when worshippers of the Sun God Ra filled their homes with green palm rushes during the winter solstice, to symbolize the triumph of life over death.Homeowner, Jennifer Houghton poses below her family's portrait in the whimsical Winter Wonderland that is her Highland Park near Dallas, Texas home in 2016. Jennifer produces a home décor blog and Instagram account, both entitled “Turtle Creek Lane.”Jennifer Houghton’s 2016 Christmas tree in her Highland Park home was a massive holiday confection straight out of a fairy tale.Similarly, the early Roman celebration of Saturnalia, designed to appease agricultural gods who determined the fate of their crops, included the use of evergreen boughs to decorate homes. The Druids, Celts and Vikings also used them during their winter solstice ceremonies to signify hope during the seasonal dead zone.So how did the practice morph from humble branches to majestic trees? Some credit 16th Century Germany for that shift. That’s when small evergreen trees were decorated with candies, apples and berries and used in church plays. Suddenly, the pagan ritual got a Christian makeover, and the uses of larger and grander trees during the winter season spread across Europe.By comparison, Americans got in on the practice relatively late. It’s believed that the first Christmas trees appeared in German American communities in the early 1800s. But by and large, 19th century Americans still viewed the holidays as pagan until Britain’s Queen Victoria and her family were sketched standing near a brightly festooned Christmas arrangement in 1846. Soon after, members of the American elite competed to earn credit for the most lavish displays of holiday splendor.From there, it was game on for American Christmas. Nowadays, it’s hard to imagine getting through a December without encountering at least one form of iconic Christmas image, regardless of your geographic location.A Pacific Furs Tree Lot employee “flocks” a Christmas tree in Glendale, Arizona in 2011.

"Early one June morning in 1837, a few weeks after her 18th birthday, Princess Victoria was awoken by her mother to greet the Archbishop of Canterbury, who delivered the news that King William IV had just died. Victoria, still in her nightdress, had become queen. That night she wrote in her journal: “Very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.”Victoria’s accession marked a significant change. Gone were the old men who had ruled for half a century, replaced by a young queen soon to have her own family. As the future British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli told the House of Commons in a speech in 1861: “She who reigns over us has elected amid all the splendor of empire, to establish her life on the principle of domestic love.” The royal family represented youth, morality, and domesticity now.Changed, too, were the regalia worn by monarchies past. A teenage queen who stood at less than five feet tall needed better-proportioned displays of royal authority. A new coronation ring was made for Victoria, and the shafts of the scepters were altered to enable her to hold them comfortably.One of the traditional functions of the monarchy—to marry and establish a dynasty—remained, and Victoria’s mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-­Coburg-Saalfeld, and her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, introduced Victoria to her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Victoria and Albert married in February 1840. More than just a blessing of bloodlines, their union was a genuinely devoted and passionate one, lasting over 20 years until Albert’s death.Eagle turquoise brooch designed by Prince Albert in 1839-1840The British public, and Parliament, initially viewed German-born Albert as an interloper. But he nonetheless became Victoria’s primary adviser and closest ally, often helping her draft correspondence. He also presented his wife with jewelry of his own design, such as the sapphire and diamond brooch he gave her before their wedding, and a gold and porcelain set, which included a brooch, earrings, and necklace that recalled the wreath of orange blossoms she wore on their wedding day. He also designed 12 eagle-shaped brooches of turquoise, representing true love. Each has a ruby for its eye and pearls in its claws; they were worn by Victoria’s train bearers.As Britain’s imperial reach expanded under Victoria’s reign, so too did her jewelry collection. The famous Koh-i-Noor (“mountain of light”) diamond had already passed through many dynasties and dominions of Central Asia—including that of Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal—later ending up in the hands of the ruler of the Sikh empire, Ranjit Singh. When the British conquered the Sikh empire in 1849, they took the jewel from Singh’s son, and presented it to Victoria.Albert, like the crowds who flocked to see the diamond at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, was unhappy with its dull and irregular appearance and had the 186-carat stone recut into a smaller, more contemporary, brilliant oval shape. Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General of India, wrote to Victoria that he hoped she would wear it as “a trophy of the glory and strength of Your Majesty’s Empire in the East.” Victoria is said to have felt awkward about taking the Koh-i-Noor, and was embarrassed to show the recut gem to its previous owner, Maharaja­Duleep Singh, when he visited her in 1854.Instead of adorning the royal crown, it was worn by Victoria as a personal brooch (displayed prominently in the 1856 portrait of Victoria, left). Victoria’s successors, however, did not have such qualms as to featuring it on the crown, and visitors can view the diamond today at the Tower of London, set in the Queen Mother’s coronation crown.In 1854, protective of Britain’s position as an imperial power, Victoria focused her attention on the Crimean War, a conflict that arose over concerns about Russian expansion in the Ottoman Empire. From insisting that she be shown correspondence between military commanders to visiting hundreds of wounded soldiers in hospitals and writing condolence letters to war widows, Victoria assumed her role as commander in chief of the British military with great resolve. As Panmure wrote: “You never saw anybody so entirely taken up with military affairs as she is.” The war made Victoria’s reputation as a monarch who protected not only Britain’s imperial interests but also the people who pursued them. She would respond similarly in 1899 with the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War, supporting the dispatch of troops and playing the role of imperial mother.On December 14, 1861, Albert, Victoria’s “Angel,” died. “Without him, life is utter darkness,” the 42-year-old queen wrote. Devastated, she refused to attend official events, eschewing the ceremonial duties that her role required. But while publicly reclusive, she used her pen to continue to play a daily and active role in domestic and European political affairs, presiding over a period of intense social reform in the 1870s and 1880s. Public health was improved and the electorate almost doubled. She persuaded the government to strengthen Britain’s army, deterred Russia’s plans to conquer Constantinople, and oversaw the expansion of British influence in East Asia.She was also preoccupied with the lives and marriages of her nine children and growing brood of grandchildren. By the 1890s Victoria was related to the royal houses of nearly every European power either directly or by marriage. Through her offspring, she monitored the monumental changes taking place in Germany and the rise of Bismarck in Prussia.Victoria returned to public life in 1866 to open Parliament, but did so dressed in black-and-white widow’s clothing. Refusing to don the imperial state crown, because it was heavy, and impossible to wear with her white lace mourning veil, in 1870 she commissioned a new, petite crown that could be placed over it.Despite its size—it weighed only five ounces and measured four inches in every direction—the silver crown contains 1,187 diamonds that were taken from a large necklace. Its lightness and elegance distinguish it from its predecessors, but the tiny topper mimics the form of a traditional English crown, with arches, alternating crosses, and fleurs-de-lis.Victoria first donned it at the state opening of Parliament in 1871, and continued to wear it on all state occasions, with the imperial state crown borne alongside her on a cushion. She also wore it at less formal events and for paintings and photographs. By her death in 1901, it had become so closely associated with her that it was placed on her coffin during her funeral. In 1937 King George VI added it to the regalia at the Tower of London, where it remains on show today.",
"A diver embraces a zebra shark during the Sunshine Aquarium’s annual Santa Dive performance in Japan in 2013. Even though Japan is less than one percent Christian, Christmas is a popular holiday.It’s Christmas Eve and there’s an unexpected knock at the door.

If you’re in Newfoundland, it could be friends disguised in costumes who perform comedy sketches until you can guess who they are.Christmas, an annual holiday that commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, is celebrated in unique ways in different countries, even those with few Christians. Secular celebrations of Christmas are commonplace around the world: India is less than three percent Christian, but Christmas is a national holiday. Only one percent of Japan's population is Christian, but Santa impersonators and holiday music still fill department stores. In the U.S., each person will spend more than $1,000 on the holiday, according to the National Retail Federation.

"Catalonia is known for its sea-side markets (la boqueria), gothic architecture -- championed by Antoni Gaudí -- and sparkling white champagne (cava). The territory boasts its own language (Catalun), flag, and governing body (Generalitat). But perhaps the most dramatic display of Catalonian culture comes from the people themselves, who literally and figuratively band together to build human-towers (castells).“The human tower is a metaphor for the Catalonian identity,” says Montserrat Rossell Xicola, a journalist and producer of the film Castells, created by Autobahn, a London-based production company. Xicola grew up in the Vallès Oriental region of Catalonia and always admired castells Her brother temporarily competed though she never participated herself.Observers say the practice is symbolic of togetherness, the elimination of class differences, and Catalonia’s welcoming atmosphere, Xicola says. “You can step on your boss in a human tower, you cannot do it outside this.”“It's a very important cultural heritage in our country,” she says.Castells are constructed by Catalans of all ages, who stack themselves on top of each other by climbing up backs and shoulders. The practice was first documented in 1801 as a cultural activity and became a competition in the 1980s. Declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2010, castells are recognized as having a “rich cultural diversity” and significance within Catalonia.There are currently between 60 and 70 castell teams (colles) in Catalonia, some of which appear at large, bi-annual competitions in Tarragona, Spain. The teams are awarded points based on how high they can build their towers without falling. The most ambitious castells stretch ten levels high, each level the height of a person. In 2018, 42 teams competed at Tarragona.“So little people know about [Castells] outside of Catalonia,” says Pedro de la Fuente, co-filmmaker of Castells. “We felt so lucky to be not only witnessing it but filming it. It's equivalent to going to Egypt to see the pyramids or going to Peru to see Machu Picchu.”For some practitioners building castells is a demonstration of nationalism. Nationalistic interpretations surfaced after the 1975 death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Franco banned many inherently Catalonian and Spanish practices during his rule from 1939 to 1975, such as speaking the Catalun language, waving the Catalonian flag, and observing Catalonia’s national holiday, Diada. Likewise, Franco threatened castells, allowing only one of the teams to practice.“When you're coming out of a dictatorship, you have nothing,” says Pablo Giori, a historian based in Barcelona. “They were looking for new things and [found] new things in the festivities of the towns. They were really connected with this idea of experience, that everyone became part of it.”Giori, a native of Argentina, began studying castells 11 years ago, after moving to Barcelona. Originally captivated by the structures themselves, he says he realized that “the human towers were not the most important thing. The most important thing was this idea of community, this idea of a nation.”When he talks about nationalism, Giori is not referencing a specific political party, not all members of castells uphold the same political affiliations, but an intimate connection within Catalonia’s civil society. Historical hardships, like economic crises, motivate the people to support each other, he says.“When you have problems, the best way to find a solution is by having a strong community,” Giori adds.Large castells contain five main levels. The base is called the pinya, followed by the folre, the manilles, the tronk, and the pom de dalt. The tronk is the vertical structure in the center of the castell that holds the most weight. The strongest men make up the bottom of the tronk, followed by stronger but lighter women. A small child known as the enxaneta climbs to the pom de dalt.“We saw it as a poetic reflection of the society,” says James Worsley, co-filmmaker for Castells. “You have the elders holding the weight of the younger community on their shoulders.”The enxaneta is usually a girl between 7 and 10-years-old. One teenage participant told Worsley that she started castelling when she was only 4-years-old. She must be light, nimble, and at times, fearless.As the enxaneta begins her ascent, a hush falls over the crowd. The silence lends itself to different emotions: excitement, that she may succeed; fear, that she may fail; and “a sense of importance in the air,” de la Fuente says. “Something special.”“You don't know where the tower is going to end. You don't know how many people she's going to climb,” he adds. “There's an emotional thing.”Emotions peaked in 2006, with the death of enxaneta Mariona Galindo, who suffered fatal injuries after falling from a castell. Since the incident, colles implement safety precautions like requiring children to wear helmets and providing a net during rehearsals.Women and children were not included in colles until 1980s. Since their addition, castells have become lighter and grown taller.But there may be a physical limit to castell’s growth, Giori says. Already at ten levels, the people must brainstorm how to increase their influence horizontally across Catalonia while being unable to rise vertically.“At some point, you can’t make it bigger and bigger every year,” Giori says. “There is a physical limit.They have to find another motivation for doing human towers.”For now, their cultural bond is enough to keep building.“It's a very close-knit activity,” de la Fuente says. “You have people who are going to be breathing in your face, and you're going to be grabbing hold of other people's bodies. When they do this, it's almost like they become one.”",
"Every holiday season, Christmas markets transform the main squares of cities across Europe into winter wonderlands. Twinkling lights adorn wooden huts and boughs of holly hang from street lamps. Vendors sell hand-carved ornaments and Nativity scene figurines, alongside piping hot mugs of glühwein (mulled wine), as Christmas carols fill the air. In Germany alone—where the tradition began—there are usually 2,500 to 3,000 holiday markets a year. Now, the markets are returning after two years of COVID-19 related closures.Historians say preserving this cultural practice in old city centers is as important as shoring up medieval cathedrals or protecting ancient Roman ruins. They argue that Germany’s markets should be inscribed on UNESCO’s intangible cultural heritage list, alongside French baguette making and dragon boat festivals in China.“What makes [the markets] so important isn’t just buying an ornament,” says Dirk Spennemann, associate professor in cultural heritage management at Australia’s Charles Sturt University, who has co-written studies about the cultural heritage of Christmas markets. “It’s this whole experience of sound, smell, visuals, but also the physicality of people around you.” What’s more, Spennemann argues that “intangible cultural heritage” encompasses traditions that are meant to be mutable, reshaped with each new generation.Christmas markets certainly fit that definition. Over their centuries-long history, they have adapted to the changing politics and social customs of each new era—from the industrial revolution to the rise of the Nazi party.Europe’s Christmas markets date back to medieval times when German territories covered a wide swath of the continent. Some of Germany’s existing Christmas markets trace their origins as far back as the 15th and 16th centuries. Dresden’s market first opened for one day on Christmas Eve in 1434. Meanwhile, the oldest evidence of Nuremberg’s Christmas market dates it to 1628, though some suspect it stretches back at least to 1530.Spennemann says it’s unclear, however, whether these early bazaars were held for Christmas or simply took place at Christmastime. Back then, people lived in scattered communities within walking distance of a church that held markets for all religious feast days. The winter market was typically the biggest, with local artisans selling pottery, meat, baked goods, and maybe some sweets, if the sugar wasn’t too expensive.There’s little record of the atmosphere of those early markets or when they shifted to offer Christmas trees, Nativity scenes, and toys. Some illustrations depict wealthy Germans hobnobbing in the main market square, while the poor shopped at back-street stalls. But Spennemann says these images are likely embellishments created by artists of later eras, who yearned for what was—to them—an idyllic Christmas past with each social class in its place.The Industrial Revolution had a profound effect on Christmas markets in the early 19th century. The rising standard of living and the emergence of the working class fueled the growth of Christmas markets. In Berlin, for example, the Christmas market grew from 303 stalls in 1805 to about 600 in 1840.As the markets began to cater to the working class, urban elites turned up their noses at the cheap gifts for sale, while police in cities across Germany complained about the unruly masses of workers who frequented them.“It was seen as being seedy, even dangerous and threatening,” says Joe Perry, associate professor of modern European and German history at Georgia State University and author of Christmas in Germany: A Cultural History.Capitalist forces also turned against the markets by the end of the 19th century. The owners of new downtown department stores campaigned to have them moved to avoid competition. From Berlin to Nuremberg, cities relocated their Christmas markets to the outskirts, where they would languish for decades.In the 1930s, Christmas markets returned to city centers across Germany—with the aid of the Nazi Party.Christmas was a political football at the time, with politicians endeavoring to reshape its traditions to fit their anti-capitalist or atheist leanings. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933, his newly empowered political party wasted no time in transforming Christmas from a religious holiday devoted to peace on Earth to a nationalist one that extolled German heritage. As Erin Blakemore writes for History magazine, party officials inserted Nazi imagery into Nativity scenes, filled Advent calendars with party propaganda, and rewrote Christmas carols like “Silent Night” to deemphasize its Christian connotations.These efforts weren’t unprecedented. Perry points out that the idea of a culturally German Christmas has “deep, deep roots.” Many traditions, from Advent calendars to Christmas trees, are thought to have originated in Germany. Protestant reformer Martin Luther is often credited with being the first to put lights on the Christmas tree, after a nighttime stroll through a German forest under a starry sky.(Why do we have Christmas trees?)Christmas markets were a natural fit in the effort to realign Christmas with Nazi ideology because they were a popular tradition that already existed. In Nuremberg, for example, Nazi mayor Willy Liebel moved the market back to the city center in 1933, as “a way to erase what he called the ‘un-German and race-alien influences’ that had inspired the market’s relocation,” Perry writes in his book.The market also debuted an opening ceremony featuring the christkind, an angelic figure typically portrayed by a blond-haired, blue-eyed local girl. Berlin reopened its Christmas market the following year, with speeches from Nazi leaders, such as Joseph Goebbels.Soon after, Nazi politicians began to standardize stall decorations and the items that vendors could sell—such as German-made ornaments, toys, handicrafts, bratwurst, and sugary confections.Economics drove part of these efforts to rejuvenate the markets, says Perry. In the midst of the Great Depression, Nazi leaders believed the sales of German-made goods could help stimulate the economy and raise the spirits of German citizens.And it did. In Berlin, 1.5 million people visited the market in 1934, a record broken two years later when two million people visited. But that economic prosperity ended with the start of World War II. In 1941, many cities shuttered their markets.Germany’s Christmas markets came roaring back after the end of the war—and only grew in the following decades, as an economic boom in the 1960s and 1970s and the rise of consumerism fueled the growth of Christmas shopping. These economic shifts transformed the Christmas markets into mass cultural events—up to a thousand tour buses full of shoppers might descend on a city’s Christmas market during any given weekend.The Nazi’s role in reshaping the Christmas markets was largely swept under the rug, even as many of the traditions they instituted remained. When Nuremberg’s market returned in 1948, so did the christkind, albeit with a new prologue, or welcoming speech. (However, the role would continue to be given to white actresses until 2019, when the selection of a biracial teenager prompted racist outrage from far-right politicians.)While some Germans sought to trivialize the Nazis’ role in shaping the Christmas markets, Perry points out that other German political parties through the years have sought to influence the tradition. In the early 20th century, Marxists tried to reframe Christmas as a pagan rather than a religious holiday. Later, the Communist Party in East Berlin would also attempt to align Christmas with its values. Christmas “has always been pushed and pulled around,” he adds.(In Japan, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” is a Christmas carol.)In Germany, meanwhile, the number of Christmas markets has also been on the rise for the last 50 years—tripling from about 950 markets in the 1970s to about 3,000 in 2019. Local tourism bureaus use them to persuade people to visit during winter’s bleakest days, and tour companies have expanded from bus tours to Christmas market river cruises that stop in cities along the Danube, from Germany to Hungary.But the pandemic interrupted all that in 2020. Although many cities attempted to recreate the markets through virtual reality portals and drive-through stalls, Spennemann and Parker argue in a study published in the journal Heritage that the lackluster response to the substitute Christmas markets highlighted the importance of the real thing.“Clearly substitutions don’t work,” Spennemann says. “Unless you go and give people the virtual 3D experience and send them a vial of smells, it’s not going to work.”By documenting the history of the Christmas markets, the scholars hope to lay the groundwork should Germany decide to apply for UNESCO recognition. But Spennemann says that safeguarding the markets doesn’t mean keeping them from changing—it’s to keep them alive through change.Some people, he says, insist that traditional German culture must involve wearing lederhosen and drinking from steins, but “they deep-freeze culture, and they ritualize it, and they kill it. Intangible culture is a vibrant expression which will change. So you have to allow for that change.”In fact, he argues that intangible cultural traditions like the Christmas markets are so meaningful because they have evolved to represent who we are at any given time—for the better and, yes, sometimes for worse.By the 1980s and 1990s, Germany’s Christmas markets had become so beloved that they became a cultural export. Cities in countries around the world—including the United States, Japan, and India—began to host their own German-style Christmas markets, complete with bratwurst, glühwein, and twinkling lights. In the United Kingdom, the number of Christmas markets more than tripled from about 30 in 2007 to more than a hundred in 2017.Some of the most bustling markets around the world, now back in merry force, include the Edinburgh Christmas Market, which offers drams of whisky, a Ferris wheel, and artisan stalls in the Scottish capital. Plaisirs D’Hiver (Winter Pleasures) clusters around a towering decorated spruce in the center of Brussels, Belgium, and includes chocolate sellers, live music, and a light-and-sound show. In New York City, the Union Square Holiday Market brings together nearly 200 local vendors from pottery makers and jewelry designers to hot cocoa mixers and poutine chefs.Amy McKeever is a senior writer and editor at National Geographic.

"Five thousand amateur chorus members sang “Ode to Joy” from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in Tokyo, Japan, in February of 2006. The sing-alongs to the German composer’s piece about brotherhood and understanding have been a yuletide tradition in Japan for more than a century.Barricaded behind barbed-wires, a dusty POW camp on a foliage-shrouded Japanese island seems like a strange birthplace for one of the world’s largest singalongs. But in the shadow of World War I, a scrappy performance of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony so captivated the hearts of the Japanese people that it spawned a beloved tradition still used to ring in the New Year.Each December, hundreds of concerts of the Ninth, with its message of peace, hope, and joy, take place throughout Japan, in venues from shopping malls to community centers. Many of these performances include singalongs of “Ode to Joy,” the choral portion of the symphony’s fourth movement.This engraving of German-Austrian composer Ludwig van Beethoven dates from 1882. His Ninth Symphony was first performed in Asia more than a hundred years ago by German prisoners of war in Japan.The most anticipated concert is the Suntory 10,000 Freude at Osaka’s Suntory Hall, which usually features 10,000 amateur and professional singers. “The Japanese people’s relationship with the Ninth weaves a social connection and a musical one together,” says conductor Jeffrey Bernstein. “For them, singing ‘Ode to Joy’ is about connecting.”The unlikely story of how a European composition became Japan’s essential holiday tune begins hundreds of years ago in Germany. But in a year where the coronavirus pandemic has stopped most group singing, is this the end of its reign in Asia?Beethoven was born in December 1770 in Bonn, an old German town along the Rhine River. He moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1792 to study under famed Classical composer Franz Joseph Haydn. While living in Vienna, Beethoven made huge strides in his career, performing in theaters and concert halls, including the opera house Theater an der Wien and Palais Lobkowitz, a Baroque palace that’s now a museum. However, his personal life was in shambles.“He had terrible health throughout his life. He wanted love but didn’t find it. He wanted a family but didn’t have one,” says author and filmmaker Kerry Candaele, whose movie, Following the Ninth, documented the global impact of Beethoven’s final symphony. “He was one of the greatest manipulators of sound and he lost his hearing.”Some scholars theorized that it took Beethoven a lifetime to write the Ninth Symphony, which he completed before his death in 1827. He was inspired by the writings of German poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, who in 1785 penned the “Ode to Joy,” touting a universal message of brotherhood, joy, and freedom. By incorporating Schiller’s words in the fourth movement, the Ninth debuted in Vienna’s Theater am Kärntnertor in 1824 as the world’s first symphony featuring a chorus.Though popular in Europe, the Ninth was not performed in Asia until nearly a century later—in the most unlikely place. During World War I, Japan allied with Britain and captured enemy troops from the German-occupied Chinese island of Qingdao. About 1,000 German soldiers were transported to Naruto, a small town in Tokushima Prefecture that was more accustomed to welcoming Buddhist temple pilgrims than European POWs.At Naruto’s Bando POW camp, the commanding officer encouraged captured soldiers to participate in activities like operating shops, publishing newspapers, and playing music. On June 1, 1918, German POW Hermann Hansen led the in-residence, 45-member Tokushima Orchestra using partially handmade instruments and an all-male, 80-member choir of other POWS in a performance of the Ninth. Wealthy classical music patron and politician Yorisada Tokugawa heard about the concert and visited the camp several months later for an encore. Japanese musicians at what’s now known as the Tokyo University of the Arts first performed the Ninth in 1925.Japan’s on-and-off relationship with Germany resumed during World War II, as did its shared appreciation for Beethoven. In December 1943, the graduation ceremony for Tokyo University students drafted to fight in the war featured a performance of the “Ode to Joy.” During the war, Japanese imperialists used the Ninth to promote nationalism; the music also had the unfortunate designation as Adolph Hitler’s favorite symphony.Susanne Hake holds a photo of her grandfather, Hermann Hake, pictured while he was a prisoner of war during World War I in Japan. He and other German POWs performed Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in 1918 at a camp in Bando, today Naruto. It was the first-ever production of Beethoven’s final symphony in Asia.“Since the first time it was performed in 1824, the Ninth has become such an iconic piece that any number of movements and individuals have become attached to it,” Candaele says. “The most notorious was Hitler, who requested the Ninth to be performed on his birthday. He considered it Aryan music, which is odd when you think about the lyrics to ‘Ode to Joy.’ ” Candaele points to phrases including “All people become brothers” and “This kiss to all the world.” He says, “How can you get Aryan racial supremacy out of that?”(Related: How Napoleon inspired a Beethoven symphony.)Hitler’s love of the Ninth didn’t stop the revolutionary ideals of the symphony’s “Ode to Joy” from resonating with people all over the world fighting authoritarian regimes. During Pinochet’s dictatorship in the 1970s, Chilean women sang the Spanish version—“Himno a la Alegria” (Hymn to Happiness)—on the streets in Valparaiso and from inside the Tres Álamos concentration camp. In 1989, the Ninth could be heard blasting from makeshift loudspeakers throughout the student-led Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, China.That same year, on December 25, legendary American conductor Leonard Bernstein—son of Jewish-Ukrainian immigrants—conducted the symphony at the majestic neo-classic Konzerthaus at Gendarmenmarkt square to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall. Bernstein famously changed the word Freude (joy) to Freiheit (freedom).Scholars see a clear through line. “All great music does a number of things,” Candaele says. “This symphony has that capacity to heal and repair broken people and a broken world at times. The Ninth elevates us to recognize the best parts of ourselves.”Snowcapped Mount Fuji casts a bright spot on the frozen surface of Lake Yamanaka. The 12,388-foot (3,776-meter) volcano, which last erupted almost 300 years ago, is for the Japanese an enduring national symbol of serenity and strength. On a clear day, the iconic peak can be seen from Tokyo, 70 miles (112 kilometers) away.Post WWII, the Japanese people’s devotion to Beethoven remained steadfast. During the U.S.-led occupation, traditional Japanese music, including kabuki, was censored. War-related movies and references to Japan’s past were also forbidden, but surprisingly, Beethoven eluded censorship. In December 1946, in a Tokyo still emerging from the devastation of war, people showed up in droves to watch Polish-Jewish conductor Joseph Rosenstock and the New Symphony Orchestra’s performance of the hope-filled Ninth.“The Japanese people find the idea of surviving, rebuilding, and moving forward a powerful force,” says Jeffrey Bernstein, the first American to lead a Daiku concert in Naruto City, Japan, near where those POWs first performed it.Though that camp is long gone, there are still remnants of the cultural exchange that took place in Naruto more than a century ago. Today, tourists can buy potted plants and German sausages from a roadside station called “Home of the Ninth,” built from parts and materials from one of the prison barracks. Dioramas, photos, and videos of life in Bando fill the Naruto German House, and a statue of Beethoven stands dramatically in front of a grove of cherry blossom trees.Over the years, the enthusiasm for the Ninth continued. Textile designer Yasu Tanano recalls learning the Ninth in junior high in the 1960s. “We sang ‘Ode to Joy’ in Japanese. The phrase and tones were so easy to grasp and keep in our minds. I often was humming the Daiku when I was a kid,” he said. “Everyone around my age knows it and still remembers it.”An avid choral performer, Tanano knew he wanted to participate in the first-ever Ichiman-nin Daiku (10,000 people Ninth) concert in 1983, which commemorated the construction of the Osaka-Jo Hall in Osaka. To prepare, Tanano and thousands of other singers rehearsed for months, learning the lyrics in German.Singers from all over Japan participate in large holiday choral performances of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” including this one in 2008 in Tokyo.On the day of the concert, the number of performers in the auditorium dwarfed the audience. Men in black tuxedos or suits and women in white blouses and long black skirts took up almost three-quarters of the concert hall seats, while the orchestra set up stage in the middle of the venue. Even though Tanano had sung the “Ode to Joy” in previous concerts, he was astounded to do it with a 10,000-member choir. “The sound was extremely and unexpectedly loud,” says Tanano. “I am sure every singer was stunned. It was an incredible experience—my body was shaking.”In the years that followed, thousands of amateurs and professionals from all over Japan and other countries have gathered annually at Osaka-Jo Hall for the year-end hurrah. Shizuma Ueda, a systems engineer from Sakai city, was mesmerized after watching his first Ichiman-nin Daiku concert in 2005. “I saw the faces of the performers and I knew I wanted to sing onstage too,” Ueda says. Since then, he’s sung in 14 consecutive performances.(Related: Tune into these trips with musical themes.)While the Ichiman-nin Daiku in Osaka is the largest of the performances, each year, nearly 200 smaller-scale concerts take place all over Japan. Local amateur choral groups from Hokkaido to Kyushu encourage anyone who wants to sing—teachers, office workers, homemakers, children—to join. Music stores sell “Ode to Joy” sheet music and bars offer karaoke accompaniments to the song.For some Japanese, singing “Ode to Joy” is a way for them to connect more broadly with humanity. “Nowadays, we observe many conflicts between different religions or different ethnic groups happening around the world,” says Toshiaki Kamei, former mayor of Naruto and the director of the All-Japan Association of Daiku Choral Societies. “We believe singing Daiku together with people from various cultural backgrounds helps us learn to accept diversity and promote world peace.”While world wars, fascism, and communism couldn’t silence the Ninth, the current pandemic has posed an obstacle to group singing. Performing in—or being in the audience for—the famed composer’s final work would have been even more meaningful in December 2020, Beethoven’s 250th birthday. Numerous festivals, exhibitions, and concerts were planned worldwide to commemorate his life and work.The pandemic has made any large celebration verboten, and group singing, which spreads virus-carrying aerosols, is particularly dangerous. So in Japan, devoted Beethoven fans had to figure out how to keep this holiday singing tradition going without threatening public health.Christmas lights line a street leading in the direction of Tokyo Tower. Japan has adopted many Western Christmas customs including decorations and choral performances.“The pandemic is especially heartbreaking for people who love group singing, because it is such a unique social connection for them,” says Jeffrey Bernstein.But that hasn’t stopped some from trying. In March, when most of Europe was under strict lockdown, musicians and citizens in Italy and Germany could be heard singing “Ode to Joy” from their balconies and backyards. Over and over again, musicians from the Colorado Symphony to Maryland’s Charles County Youth Orchestra Musicians to the Netherland’s Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra have performed “Ode to Joy” virtually as a sort of pandemic theme song.In Japan, Ichiman-nin Daiku, now known as the Suntory 10,000 Ninth, held a scaled-down version of a “miracle concert” on December 6 to include 1,000 singers and 1,000 audience—with safety measures, including social distancing and plastic mouth shields. They were joined by videos of 9,000 other participants singing in their own homes.(Related: This Japanese island knows the secret to long life—and resilience.)Unwilling to let a global crisis rain on the famed composer’s parade, organizers of the celebrations surrounding Beethoven’s 250th birthday have extended the festivities to the middle of September 2021.In the meantime, even without a blowout celebration, the spirit of Beethoven’s Ninth lives on. “This piece originated in Beethoven’s pen a couple hundred years ago, and it has literally circled the world and involved countless people,” says Bernstein. “The message is so humanistic. The text says someday all human beings will treat each other like siblings. It reminds us that there is more to being human than just going after what you want for yourself. It’s about connecting with other people.”",

"Two giants who shook the foundations of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, Ludwig van Beethoven and Napoleon Bonaparte were born just one year apart—Beethoven in Bonn, near Cologne (now Germany) in 1770 and Bonaparte in Ajaccio, Corsica, in 1769. These two men radically transformed their respective fields, leaving behind legacies that all of their followers were forced to acknowledge while attempting to transcend.Napoleon’s military prowess after the French Revolution led to a quick rise to power. Victory after victory burnished the young man’s reputation, bringing him acclaim all over Europe as a triumph over the old ways.Beethoven’s innovative compositions took music to new heights. His symphonies told entire stories without words, unfurling emotions and painting pictures that immersed listeners like nothing before it. Beethoven dominated the musical world the same way Napoleon reigned over the military and political spheres. These two men never met, but a shared critical moment in the early 19th century revealed a stark contrast between these two icons.Ludwig van Beethoven was born to a middleclass family. As a young man, he was forced to support his mother and siblings due to his father Johann’s alcoholism. Although he was never regarded as a prodigy as the young Mozart before him, or Mendelssohn after him (who wrote five operas while still a child), Beethoven’s talent was impressive. At the age of 14, he was employed as second organist at the court of the regional ruler, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, assisting Christian Gottlob Neefe, the principal court organist and Beethoven’s music teacher. In his piano and composition lessons, Neefe awoke in his student a deep love for the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and a voracious appetite for reading. (See also: A composer's passion, ignited by conflict.)Three years later, the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Maximilian Franz, decided to promote the young musician. Bonn-Cologne was, at this time, a state within the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by Maximilian’s brother, Joseph II. The elector decided the 17 year old would go to Vienna, imperial capital and European center of classical music. There in 1787, Beethoven was received by none other than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. There is a story, (regarded by some historians as apocryphal) that, on hearing him play, Mozart said to his wife, “Watch out for that boy. One day he will give the world something to talk about.” Beethoven had hoped to study with Mozart, but his trip was cut short when Beethoven’s mother fell seriously ill, and he had to return home.At this time, Mozart and fellow Austrian Joseph Haydn were the twin suns of the musical firmament. Their music was the standard to aspire to, yet it would also come to represent what had to be transcended. The influential English music historian Charles Burney spoke for many in the late 1700s when he wrote of music as the “art of pleasing,” and its highest aim to transmit sweetness and refinement. Beethoven’s work would later help overturn this aesthetic standard.As a young performer in Bonn, Beethoven was steeped in the music of Joseph Haydn. The Bonn elector library held more than 100 scores by the Austrian. When Beethoven met Haydn in 1790, it must have felt like a brush with greatness. As Beethoven prepared to move to Vienna, his patron, Count Waldstein, assured him that “[there] you will receive the spirit of Mozart from the hands of Haydn.” After his arrival in Vienna, the young German composer took lessons with the maestro. According to some accounts, Beethoven chafed at Haydn’s rigorous tasks, and secretly took classes from other teachers. Even so, his influence was considerable. The elder composer taught him the expressive pos- sibilities of the string quartet, a genre that Beethoven later took in a direction that baf- fled his contemporaries, and only became widely appreciated in the 20th century.Because his family relied on him for financial support, the teenaged Beethoven worked as a music teacher. His pupils were often the children of the nobility, including the cultured von Breuning family. Expanding Beethoven’s social networks, the von Breunings introduced him to a family friend, the Count of Waldstein, a Viennese aristocrat and music lover. Impressed by Beethoven’s talent, the count later commissioned several works from the composer.The relationship with the count epitomizes the compromise musicians had to make between their ideals and their pocketbooks. In practical terms, composers needed the support of aristocratic patrons to fund the creation of their music, even if they espoused democratic values.In 1790 Beethoven met Joseph Haydn, who was so impressed with the young musician that he offered to take him on as a pupil in Vienna. Two years later, Beethoven moved there, but he only studied a short time with Haydn. In Vienna excellent social connections with wealthy families enabled him to earn a good living. One of the most important of these was the music lover Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian von Lobkowitz.Beethoven was 18 in the summer of 1789 when astonishing news reached Bonn: The storming of the Bastille prison in Paris on July 14 had ushered in a new order based on revolutionary principles of individual liberty and rights.The impact of the French Revolution on the German people was deep and inspirational. German nationalist historian Ernst Moritz Arndt, later a savage critic of the revolution, acknowledged its impact: “It has planted into heads and hearts essential ideas for the foundation of the future, which only 20 or 30 years ago most people would have been afraid to conceive.”At first, enthusiasm extended even to the imperial rulers. Early in the revolution, both Joseph II and Maximilian Franz saw events in France as confirming the ideals of the Enlightenment. At Bonn’s recently founded university (where Beethoven briefly enrolled), Eulogius Schneider, a fiery lecturer, and former monk, praised the storming of the Bastille in a poem. The work was published in a Jacobin journal which counted Beethoven as one of its subscribers. Even if he never became a full-blown radical, Beethoven was exposed to the general sympathy and excitement stoked by events in France.It was a time of phenomenal political upheaval that intrigued Beethoven generally, and touched him personally. During his first full year in Vienna in 1793, news broke of the executions of French king Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, aunt to the Holy Roman emperor Francis II. A year later, the French occupied Beethoven’s home town, Bonn.Beethoven began to note the campaigns of the young, anti-monarchist general, Napoleon Bonaparte—first in Italy (1796-97), then in Egypt and Palestine (1798-99). Despite his uneven military record in Egypt, Napoleon returned to France a hero, and was proclaimed first consul of the French Republic. In 1800 his defeat of the Austrian army at Marengo forced Austria into making major concessions to France. Napoleon was at the center of a new age being born in Europe, and Beethoven was impressed by this bright new light.In his early years in Vienna Beethoven was known as a brilliant piano virtuoso, whose compositions attracted a great deal of attention. In 1798, however, he was dealt a bitter blow when he began to lose his hearing, No single cause has been attributed to his deafness, but the loss caused Beethoven great anguish.Beethoven spent the summer of 1802 in the village of Heiligenstädt. In an unsent letter to his brothers, he expressed in harrowing detail the impact of his growing deafness as a composer: “Ah, how could I admit an infirmity in the one sense which ought to be more perfect in me than others.” The Heiligenstädt Testament, as it is now known, is written in a tone of acceptance: “With joy I hasten towards death—If it comes before I have had the chance to develop all my artistic capacities, it will still be coming too soon despite my harsh fate.“ On other occasions, however, Beethoven took a more positive attitude. A year before, broaching the topic of his deafness in a letter to a friend, he wrote: “I will seize fate by the throat; it shall not wholly overcome me. Oh, it is so beautiful to live—to live a thousand times!” The theme of the heroic struggle through grief would burst through in all its power in his Third Symphony.In 1802 his physician sent the composer to spend the summer in the nearby village of Heiligenstädt. He attempted to come to terms with his condition and wrote a letter to his two brothers about the malady that had left him “hopelessly afflicted.” Known as the Heiligenstädt Testament, it was never sent, and found only after his death.The testament coincides with the beginning of what is sometimes termed his heroic phase. His music became more emotionally raw, traits that would erupt triumphantly in his Third Symphony. This great work, opus 55, is noted not only for its length (it was much longer than any other symphony of the time) but also its range. It expresses ideas across a wide canvas, embracing Beethoven’s personal misfortune, experimentation in musical ideas, and his experience of the tumult of war.Fired with zeal by the ideas of liberty and equality that he considered embodied in Napoleon, Beethoven decided to dedicate his Third Symphony to the French commander. Beethoven was sketching out preliminary plans for the symphony and carefully weighing his opinions of Napoleon.Then, in spring 1804, as he was finishing the symphony, news came to Vienna that Napoleon had declared himself emperor of France. Beethoven’s response, according to his protégé Ferdinand Ries, was a furious diatribe against his former hero: “Now he, too, will tread underfoot all the rights of man [to] indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men [and] become a tyrant!” A page in the preserved score shows where the word Bonaparte has been heavily struck through with a pen.The composer’s decision to remove Napoleon’s name remained a private one. He did not speak out publicly against the French emperor, but instead made a practical decision to dedicate the Third Symphony to Prince Lobkowitz, one of his first patrons in Vienna.On the score’s publication in 1806, a year after its premiere, the Third Symphony was entitled Sinfonia Eroica (Heroic Symphony), with the subtitle: “Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.” For all that Napoleon’s name had been erased, the masterwork is nevertheless haunted by him. The passionate strains of the symphony encapsulate the turmoil of the Napoleonic age that had inspired Beethoven’s music, and shaped his life.The Third Symphony premiered in April 1805, in Vienna’s Theater an der Wien, under the baton of Beethoven himself. Loyal critics proclaimed it a triumph—from its opening stately melody on the cellos, the searing funeral march, the frenetic, disorienting scherzo, through to the final reiteration of the heroic theme on the brass.The wider response was muted: It left the audience, and many critics, bewildered. Far from creating a pleasing sound, the composer had created disturbing dissonances, which contribute to the sense of a titanic struggle in which hope overcomes despair. Although its first audience had never heard anything quite like it, today it is an essential part of the repertoire of the world’s great orchestras. Most musicologists agree it marks a major turning point. According to the British music writer Tom Service, it “doesn’t just stand for Napoleon, or Beethoven, but for the possibilities of the symphony itself, which is revealed as a carrier of new weight and meaning as never before in its history.”Even though Beethoven had been disgusted by Napoleon in 1804, he did not completely reject him until several years later. As the Napoleonic Wars raged across Europe, the French consul had become a conqueror, hungry for more lands. Napoleon once again attacked Austria in 1809 and even shelled Vienna, an event which Beethoven experienced firsthand.By the time of the French ruler’s defeat in Spain in 1813, Beethoven’s enthusiasm had waned so much that he wrote a piece in honor of Napoleon’s nemesis, the future Duke of Wellington, who defeated the French at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813 and ended Napoleon’s career at Waterloo two years later. In the past musical historians linked Napoleon’s defeat and an end of Beethoven’s heroic style. French essayist Romain Rolland wrote in the early 1900s: “When the man of Waterloo has fallen, Beethoven, emperor, also abdicates.”Modern researchers, however, tend to see the composer in a less reductive light. His late style certainly evolved into something different from that of the Third Symphony, but his music and writings still contain democratic ideas, culminating in the celebration of freedom and fraternal love in the setting of the “Ode to Joy” in his Ninth Symphony. His legacy as a lover of freedom is undimmed: His music has often been played in struggles against authoritarianism, such as during the Tiananmen Square protests in China in 1989 and, later that year, in the celebration following the fall of the Berlin Wall.",
"Sequined Brazilian musicians play live for a crowd. Rio de Janeiro, with its classic genres (bossa nova, choro) and newer styles (MPB, baile funk), is a great place to travel for music.From nursery rhymes to funeral hymns, music touches every aspect of our lives. It helps us remember and communicate, conform and resist; it makes us feel good. Some have even suggested it’s one of the things that makes us truly human.In 1975, UNESCO’s International Music Council named October 1 International Music Day to celebrate the enduring art, and to encourage peace and friendship among nations—which also happens to be a goal that travel can accomplish well. So while picking a handful of destinations from among the world’s many musical cities might be a fool’s errand, here are some spots renowned both for their live performance scenes and for their impact on music around the world.“The thing about Austin is, its reputation as a music city isn’t bogus,” says Chris Richards, a music critic for the Washington Post.Long a home to Americana, folk, and country, the hip Texas city also boasts Austin City Limits and SXSW, two juggernauts that have set the global template of multi-day festivals, says music journalist Tabassum Siddiqui. Both make a point to include blockbuster headliners like Paul McCartney as well as up-and-comers among their hundreds of acts. Richards also points to the city’s “incredible” hardcore punk as a vibrant “shadow scene” on the margins of more mainstream genres. Austin’s “livability fosters a variety of acts,” says Siddiqui.For neon-lit honky tonk, check out the White Horse.

Artists from ABBA to Zara Larsson are easy to spot, but Swedish songwriters are even more influential, writing hits in genres from K-pop to indie folk. “Everybody’s music literate,” says Richards, approaching their love of music with a meticulous studiousness that speaks to the culture’s strong educational and financial support of the art. Acts of all sizes from around the world tour in Stockholm, and many—like Backstreet Boys—travel there to learn from songwriting greats.

Korea’s carefully strategic nurturing of “idol groups” packaged for international as well as domestic markets has made Seoul a hotbed of pop.But that’s not all there is to Seoul’s music: You name it, they’ve got it. “The city’s scene seems to be thriving, thanks to having lots of music venues of all kinds, from jazz bars to cafes where you can sit and listen to vinyl. The clubbing scene there is huge: Hometown DJs play to big crowds … and the R&B scene is on the rise as well,” says Siddiqui. Indie rock and punk metal also get their spot in the limelight.The city’s 10 million-strong population (about the size of all of Sweden) comes out in force to live shows as well, making it a can’t-miss stop for touring artists and a smorgasbord for visiting music lovers. Café Veloso hosts acts of all kinds, as does Strange Fruit. The Hongdae area is the “ground zero” of music, though as gentrification takes hold, many venues are looking to find new homes elsewhere in the enormous city.Other great Asian music cities: Tokyo, Sinagpore, HamamatsuSouth Africa’s capital has seen its share of strife, and its music has emerged as a powerful reaction to the people’s struggles against apartheid and its racist legacies.“In the 1950s, black musical artists were outspoken about their oppression,” writes Lawrence Burney for Vice. Now younger artists, growing up post-apartheid and free from the censorship laws that constrained their mentors, are tackling the same issues in new styles.There's trap and hip-hop setting a Joburg spin on American genres; there's the traditional music of the city's dozen-plus ethnic groups, plus pop, house, and classic jazz.

But Brazil’s legendary city has plenty to offer a new millennium.MPB (música popular brasileira, or Brazilian pop), sertenejo, and choro are national mainstays that also find a place in Rio. But baile funk, a “hybridized dance music that mutates eighties Miami bass into favela culture,” is also worth the trip, says Richards. Popularized during the blogosphere’s mid-2000s explosion, the genre has been championed by the like of American DJ Diplo—but it remains a uniquely Rio sound, meant for a “beautiful, bass-heavy sound” bouncing off the walls of warehouse raves regularly served by unofficial, local night buses.“Dance musics that are specific to a city are so powerful to me,” says Richards. “When the sound belongs to the city, the intensity of that communion is amplified a hundredfold. Even as a tourist, you can feel it.” Even for those who can’t understand the (“absolutely filthy”) Portuguese lyrics, the thumping bass “speaks to the universal ear,” he says.“Obviously you can say a million corny things about music as the universal language,” Richards adds. “But I do feel there’s something human that happens on any kind of dance floor.”Other great South American music cities: Bogotá, São Paulo, Buenos Aires",
"One day several years ago Valorie Salimpoor took a drive that would change the course of her life. She was at the peak of what she now calls her “quarter-life crisis,” not knowing what kind of career she wanted or how she might use her undergraduate neuroscience training. Hoping an outing might clear her head, that day she jumped in her car and switched on the radio. She heard the charging tempo and jaunty, teasing violin of Johannes Brahms’s Hungarian Dance No. 5.“This piece of music came on, and something just happened,” Salimpoor recalls. “I just felt this rush of emotion come through me. It was so intense.” She pulled over to the side of the street so she could concentrate on the song and the pleasure it gave her.When the song was over, Salimpoor’s mind raced with questions. “I was thinking, wow, what just happened? A few minutes ago I was so depressed, and now I’m euphoric,” she says. “I decided that I had to figure out how this happened — that that’s what I’m going to do with the rest of my life.”Music moves people of all cultures, in a way that doesn’t seem to happen with other animals. Nobody really understands why listening to music — which, unlike sex or food, has no intrinsic value — can trigger such profoundly rewarding experiences. Salimpoor and other neuroscientists are trying to figure it out with the help of brain scanners.Yesterday, for example, researchers from Stanford reported that when listening to a new piece of classical music, different people show the same patterns of synchronized activity in several brain areas, suggesting some level of universal experience. But obviously no one’s experience is exactly the same. In today’s issue of Science, Salimpoor’s group reports that when you listen to a song for the first time, the strength of certain neural connections can predict how much you like the music, and that these preferences are guided by what you’ve heard and enjoyed in the past.After Salimpoor had the car epiphany, she rushed home to her computer and Googled “music and the brain.” That led her to graduate school at McGill University, working in the lab of neuroscientist Robert Zatorre.A few years ago, Salimpoor and Zatorre performed another type of brain scanning experiment in which participants listened to music that gave them goosebumps or chills. The researchers then injected them with a radioactive tracer that binds to the receptors of dopamine, a chemical that’s involved in motivation and reward. With this technique, called positron emission tomography or PET, the researchers showed that 15 minutes after participants listened to their favorite song, their brains flooded with dopamine.The dopamine system is old, evolutionarily speaking, and is active in many animals during sex and eating. “But animals don’t get intense pleasures to music,” Salimpoor says. “So we knew there had to be a lot more to it.”In the new experiment, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to track real-time brain activity as participants listened to the first 30 seconds of 60 unfamiliar songs. To quantify how much they liked the music, participants were given the chance to buy the full version of each song — with their own money! — using a computer program resembling iTunes. The program was set up like an auction, so participants would choose how much they were willing to spend on the song, with bids ranging from $0 to $2.You can imagine how tricky it was to design this experiment. All of the participants had to listen to the same set of never-heard-before songs, and yet, in order to get enough useable data, there had to be a reasonable chance that they would like some of the songs enough to buy them.Salimpoor began by giving 126 volunteers comprehensive surveys about their musical preferences. “We asked them to list all of the music they listen to, everything they like, everything they’ve ever bought,” Salimpoor says. She ultimately scanned 19 volunteers who had indicated similar preferences, mostly electronic and indie music. “In Montreal there’s a big indie scene,” she says.To create the list of unfamiliar songs, Salimpoor first looked at songs and artists that showed up on many of the volunteers’ surveys. She plugged those choices into musical recommendation programs, such as Pandora and iTunes, to find similar but less well-known selections. She also asked people who worked at local music stores what new songs they’d recommend in those genres.Here’s a sampling of 3 songs from the final list of 60:The brain scans highlighted the nucleus accumbens, often referred to as the brain’s ‘pleasure center’, a deep region of the brain that connects to dopamine neurons and is activated during eating, gambling and sex. It turns out that connections between the nucleus accumbens and several other brain areas could predict how much a participant was willing to spend on a given song. Those areas included the amygdala, which is involved in processing emotion, the hippocampus, which is important for learning and memory, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making.The data are “compelling,” especially because the study objectively quantified the participants’ preferences, notes Thalia Wheatley, a psychology professor at Dartmouth College who has studied links between music, motion and emotion. The emphasis on connectivity between regions, rather than any particular region by itself, is also intriguing, she says. “Cortical activity alone does not predict bid value. Hooking up the temporal and evaluative processing in the cortex with the (more primitive) reward areas appears to be the key.”So why is it that one person might spend $2 on a song while another pans it? Salimpoor says it all depends on past musical experiences. “Depending on what styles youre used to — Eastern, Western, jazz, heavy metal, pop — all of these have very different rules they follow, and they’re all implicitly recorded in your brain,” she says. “Whether you realize it or not, every time you’re listening to music, you’re constantly activating these templates that you have.”Using those musical memory templates, the nucleus accumbens then acts as a prediction machine, she says. It predicts the reward that you’ll feel from a given piece of music based on similar types of music you’ve heard before. If you like it better than predicted, it registers as intense pleasure. If you feel worse than predicted, you feel bored or disappointed.“New music is presumably rewarding not only because it fits implicitly learned patterns but because it deviates from those patterns, however slightly,” Wheatley says. But this finding leads to new questions. “It just made me wonder whether people have different preferences or tolerances for how much a new song deviates from the well-worn path of previously heard music structures.”There are lots of other questions for future studies to probe. How does our brain make those musical templates? How long do we have to listen to a song before we know whether we like it? Why did my sister and I have such drastically different musical tastes growing up, even though our exposures were pretty much the same?But for now the study has given Salimpoor a new way to think about what happened to her that day in the car. “That day, it all seemed like such a big mystery — what the heck is happening in my brain?” she says. But if she heard the song again today, she’d be able to tell a reasonable story of her mind’s workings.“I’d be like, oh my god I just released dopamine, and my nucleus accumbens is now communicating with the superior temporal gyrus, and that’s pulling up some other memories of when I was 12 and playing the violin,” she says, laughing. “And then that’s linking it to my visual centers, so I can imagine this perfect synchronized orchestra and me playing a violin in there. And I’d be predicting the next sounds from each instrument in the orchestra, and the whole orchestra, so it’s a local and global prediciton going on at the same time.”Music, she says, is an intellectual reward. “It’s really an exercise for your whole brain.”",
"Paul McCartney is leading the Meat Free Monday campaign, asking people to skip meat once a week to “help slow climate change, preserve precious natural resources, and improve their health.” We met in London recently for an interview.Susan Goldberg: Should I call you Paul or Sir Paul or … ?Paul McCartney: Paul.SG: OK. I wasn’t sure. I’m American, so I don’t know about these things.One thing I find so interesting about your Meat Free Monday campaign is that you’re just asking for one day a week. Why did you decide to ask for only that?PM: I think if you say to people, “I’m a vegetarian. I think it’s great. I’ve been this way for 40 years. Now you should be a vegetarian,” it’s too much for them to take in. That means they’ve got to change their whole lifestyle. So what we find is, if you say to people, “Well, try one day,” they can do that. And they’re kind of willing to do that. And then some people go, “Oh. This is good.” Or “Maybe I’ll do two days.” Things like that, I don’t think you can approach with a sledgehammer. You’ve got to kind of just keep it gentle.SG: Sometimes I see environmentalists with messages, and it sounds like moralistic scolding, and I don’t know that it’s terribly effective.PM: That’s what I mean. You know, you have to realize when you leave the room, they’re going to talk about you, not necessarily in great terms. So I try and keep it something that I would’ve understood and I would’ve accepted before I was vegetarian.SG: You’ve been vegetarian for a long time, right?PM: Yeah. Years ago, Linda [his late wife] and I were on the farm, and the sheep had had lambs. It was the most beautiful time of the lambs’ life, full of energy—and at one meal, we happened to be eating a leg of lamb. We weren’t vegetarian then, so we made the connection. We said, “Should we try and not do this?” We did, and never looked back. It basically was compassion for these lambs that were in the first month of their lives and soon to have them ended. It didn’t seem right.SG: How has it changed your life?PM: I feel very healthy, and I do shows three hours long and I don’t feel knackered at the end of it. I still feel strong. So I think that’s been one of the things. But then more recently, people have started to draw this comparison between greenhouse gases and basically too much livestock on Earth. It wouldn’t be so bad if it was just one or two on a farm, but when there’s billions, the way we now do it, it has a big effect on the atmosphere.For me, the bottom line is we’re on this incredible planet, and there doesn’t appear to be another one in sight. And alongside us are these little dudes, these animals. We’ve all got the chance in life to survive, and I like the idea of giving them their best shot. I’m conscious of that now, whereas when I grew up, you never thought of it as meat. It was just some stuff that arrived from the supermarket, came all wrapped and packaged, and didn’t look like an animal. I think that’s how most people are.SG: But you brought up your daughters very differently. Today your daughter Stella doesn’t use any animal products in the clothes she designs.PM: That’s right. My kids are great, and they have always been vegetarian with the option that if they wanted to change, they could. But they never wanted to, and now they bring up their kids vegetarian. So the whole family is … and you know, nobody seems to be suffering.SG: In a lot of parts of the world, though, there are people for whom raising livestock is their livelihood. Even having one pig or goat or cow is the road out of poverty.PM: But I don’t think that’s the problem. I think the mass production is where the big problem starts to come in, where certain companies have billions of animals, often cramped in really cruel conditions.I was brought up by my mom, who’s a nurse, a midwife, and my dad was a cotton salesman. Just ordinary people in Liverpool, and we just had ordinary food, the same as everyone in our street. But when I reached a certain age, I made a change. I just thought, “You know what? Maybe this isn’t what I want to do. I’ve got the free will to do something else.”So I encourage people. I say, it’s actually quite fun when you look at what you do, what you eat, how you live, and think, “Is this what I’m going to do the rest of my life, or would it be interesting to try to make a change?” I think a lot of people do that these days.SG: You’ve been one of the most famous people in the world for a very long time. You could support so many causes and have your voice heard by a lot of people. Why this cause, and why now?PM: Well, this is personal. I do support a lot of other causes too—but this particular one, this is how I live. And I like the idea of this particular campaign because I can then say to people, “Just try it.” Nobody’s forcing anyone to do anything; you just try one day meat free, because it’s a good idea.SG: So you think some of the main advantages here are personal health, health of the planet, and compassion for animals …PM: Mm-hmm.SG: What am I leaving out?PM: Those are three pretty good ones. I’d go with those.***Thank you for reading National Geographic.",
"Iceland's largest city is nestled between mountains and coastline.Reykjavik is a very small and friendly city which just in recent years has become popular with tourists. It's not hard to have a good weekend here—just be sure to take a dip in some of our great swimming pools, try delicious local delicacies, and enjoy the great outdoors.Evening: Start your trip in Reykjavík off with a happy hour at one (or more) of our many bars downtown. If it’s sunny choose a spot around Austurvöllur, a public square, where you can sit outside, enjoy the sun, and take in the view of the historic Parliament. Or stop in at Forréttabarinn for a drink and a starter.When you’re ready for dinner, head over to the up and coming Grandi area. It's very close to downtown but has in the last couple of years changed from an industrial area to a combination of great food, culture, and industry. Messinn offers a delicious fish buffet if you want to try many sorts of Icelandic fish at one place while enjoying the beautiful view over the harbor. A little farther down the street, you’ll find Grandi Mathöll, a food hall in an old fish warehouse that has a variety of stalls and fantastic wines and beers, not to mention prosecco on draft. Also in the area are Flatey Pizza and Marshallhúsið.Sundhöllin, also known as the swimming palace, hosts an indoor pool as well as outdoor jacuzzi.After dinner, enjoy a drink or two at Slippbarinn. If you’re still up for more, move a few steps east, where you’ll find most of Reykjavík’s bars.Locals love pastries, breads, and buns. Find everything from a fresh loaf to snúður, a kind of Icelandic cinnamon bun at a local bakery.Morning: Rise and shine! We Icelanders love our bakeries and breads, cakes, and buns. Take a walk around Reykjavík and find a local bakery for breakfast. I recommend Brauð & Co. You have to try snúður, a kind of Icelandic cinnamon bun with chocolate, caramel, or pink frosting on top.Then head over to Hljómskálagarður Park and find a bench by the pond to enjoy the view. You can also bring bread to feed the ducks, but be aware they can be quite demanding.Icelanders love swimming and almost every neighborhood has a public swimming pool. In this area I recommend Vesturbæjarlaug, Sundhöllin, and Sundlaug Seltjarnarnes. After a swim at Vesturbæjarlaug, have lunch next door at the lovely café Kaffihús Vesturbæjar (or Kaffi Vest).Árbæjarsafn, an open-air history museum transports visitors into the past with staff dressed in period clothing. Make an appointment for a guided tour or choose to explore by yourself.Afternoon: After you finish lunch at Kaffi Vest, take a little walk around the neighborhood and over to Ægissíða, a street that runs along the coast. Find the hammocks that are there right by the sea. Lie back, relax, and listen to the sound of the ocean. It’s also the perfect Instagram spot!Even though is very cold in Iceland almost all year around, we just love ice cream. Try Valdís in Grandi for all kinds of flavors. If cupcakes are more your thing, visit 17 Sortir next door.Next, go horseback riding. There are a few horse rentals in Iceland but Sólhestar is the best in my totally unbiased opinion (my father-in-law owns it!).Evening: For dinner, head to the Laugardalur neighborhood and Laugaás, a really cozy old restaurant. Try the lamb and lobster feast.If you walk a little bit further into the neighborhood you will find Grasagarðu, the botanical garden. In the summer it’s open until 10 p.m. There you can see over 5,000 plant species in eight plant collections. Next door is the zoo and you can see some animals through the fences even if it’s closed. There’s also lovely Flóran Café, though it´s only open from May 1 to October 1.Now it´s time to head back downtown and have some drinks. Petersen Svítan is in a beautiful historic house once home to one of the first cinemas in Iceland. There’s a balcony where you can sit outside, have a drink, and enjoy the view over the city.Morning: On Sunday mornings there are very few people around. Walk around town, near the harbor, and enjoy being almost alone in the world.Walk into town and start the day at Hverfisgata 12. The brunch there is something else! Try the Korean chicken and the potato pizzas.Reykjavík is much more than just downtown. Head to the district in the eastern part of the city called Árbær. Start by going to Árbæjarlaug, a great swimming pool, then visit Árbæjarsafn, an open-air history museum. The staff dresses in period costumes and it feels like you’ve stepped into the past. You can make an appointment for a guided tour or just explore by yourself. Go to the coffeehouse there and have traditional Icelandic pancakes with sugar or a waffle with cream.Before you leave, visit nearby Elliðaárdalur, a beautiful recreation area in the middle of the city. There’s a lake, a waterfall, lots of bunnies, and more. It will give you a taste of what to expect on your next visit to Iceland—this time to the countryside.",
"The Andes mountains provide a stunning backdrop for downtown Bogotá.Colombia’s crime rate has hit a four-decade low, the government made peace with FARC rebels, and tourism has doubled in the last 10 years. The country is finally becoming the major destination it deserves to be. Here’s how to make the most of a trip to its capital city.Fare Game: American, Delta, JetBlue, and United fly nonstop to Bogotá from U.S. hubs for as low as $300 round trip. You can redeem United miles for award tickets on Colombian airline Avianca.Hotel with History: Many global chains are here, but the city’s most distinctive property may be the Four Seasons Hotel Casa Medina Bogotá, set in a 1946 edifice that’s a registered national landmark.Higher Ground: Though Bogotá’s motto—2,600 meters closer to the stars—is poetic, the altitude can be a challenge for some visitors. Skip rigorous activities the first few days, and stay well hydrated.View from the Top: Towering above the city, the mountain of Monserrate offers an invigorating hike. If you don’t feel like making the climb, get whisked to the summit via funicular or cable car.Skip the hike and enjoy a quick cable car ride to the top of Monserrate for great views of the city.Keeping It Real: For authentic souvenirs, browse student works at the Santo Domingo School of Arts and Crafts or fair-trade wares from indigenous communities at Artesanías de Colombia.One of the city's most popular museums, The Gold Museum, provides three floors of shine.Caffeine Buzz: Colombia is famous for its coffee, but not (yet) its café culture. Arte y Pasión Café is changing that with beans sourced from around the country and a training program for baristas.Tempting Tables: Foodie capitals Lima and Mexico City claim the glory, but Bogotá also has chef-driven restaurants. Harry Sasson and Leo regularly rank on lists of South America’s best.Culture Crawl: Visit the Botero Museum, dedicated to Colombia’s most-celebrated artist, plus the next-door Museo de Arte Miguel Urrutia (MAMU) and the nearby Casa de la Moneda currency museum.Large-scale artwork in the "Graffiti District" hopes to encourage responsible graffiti practice on city walls while celebrating both local and international artists.Take It to the Street: Some of the city’s most eye-catching art is outside. Join a Bogotá Graffiti Tour to check out the colorful creations along the lanes of downtown neighborhood La Candelaria.La Vida LGBTQ: Bogotá may not have the rainbow culture of cities like Buenos Aires and Rio, but the scene thrives in hot spots such as Theatron, one of the continent’s biggest gay nightclubs.",
"Streetlights glow in the Plaza de Armas at twilight in Lima, Peru.With the Peruvian capital’s disorienting sprawl and chaotic traffic, Lima was once for travelers little more than a way station on journeys to destinations like Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca, and the legendary surf break at Máncora. But the city of 10 million—one of the largest in Latin America—is no longer a mere staging ground for trips to other locales. An internationally renowned culinary scene, drawing from Peru’s multitudinous regional and cultural influences, has blossomed in Lima, a metropolis of eccentric neighborhoods cobbled together along the Pacific coast of South America. At the city’s annual food festival, Mistura—the largest food festival in Latin America—Peru’s delectable cuisine is on full display, but the country’s culinary bounty is also available year-round at acclaimed restaurants across the city. Today Lima is seizing with two hands—each clutching a fork and spoon—its future as a smart, global city.Awakening: Peru’s culinary efflorescence emerged after decades of civil war finally subsided in the late 1990s, and many credit the restaurant Astrid & Gastón with germinating those first early seeds of revival as peace settled over most of the country. Gastón Acurio, the Peruvian half of the couple (Astrid is German), is an icon in Peru and one of Latin America’s biggest culinary stars. The couple sparked a renaissance in Peruvian cuisine by applying their training in fine French cooking to traditional Peruvian food with results that, in the words of one recent profiler, “would inspire an entire generation of young chefs, and eventually help elevate Peruvian cuisine across the world.”These are three of the colorful dishes you might find if you stop in for a meal at Astrid & Gastón.At Astrid & Gastón you can choose to eat in the main dining area, or have your meal serves in a private dining room.Diversity: From the beaches and craggy cliffs where Pacific waves lap at the 1,500-mile coastline, to the snowcapped Andes mountains, to the steamy Amazon rain forest, Peru enjoys an extraordinary diversity of ecological zones, and Central makes a point of celebrating them all. “We organized the menu as an experience of altitudes, where we share what we see in specific places, specific ecosystems, a sense of place and landscape,” says head chef Virgílio Martínez. Over an expansive menu, Central takes patrons on a journey from the sea to the extreme altitudes using techniques both modern and ancient, local and global, “to replicate or communicate what’s going on in these places,” Martínez says.Sea: Excellent seafood can be found throughout Lima, thanks to a lengthy coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the area’s marine biodiversity, but in no dish is Lima’s fresh-fish bonanza more apparent than the one that most defines the city: ceviche. You can find the Peruvian staple—raw, ultrafresh fish cured in citrus—served in nooks and crannies throughout Lima, but at La Mar, Gastón Acurio offers guests—in addition to the classic, simple preparation—innovative ceviches incorporating ingredients like mushrooms, sweet potatoes, or local rocoto chilies.La Central restaurant in Lima, Peru, offers a view of the kitchen beyond the tables.A dish at La Central doubles as a work of art.Rain Forest: On the other side of the country, opposite the sea and on the far side of the Andes, the country slopes downward into one of the richest ecosystems on Earth: the Amazon rain forest. Chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino celebrates and explores the dizzying richness of the Amazon in his two Lima restaurants, Ámaz, in the stylish Miraflores district, and Malabar, in tony San Isidro. Schiaffino has developed strong relationships with indigenous tribes in the Amazon, through whom he sources the rare ingredients that allow him to assemble an eclectic menu at Ámaz, featuring items like river snails with sofrito and chorizo, and traditional Amazonian juane: chicken, rice, and a hodgepodge of additional ingredients wrapped in leaves and boiled. At Malabar, enjoy menu items featuring ingredients like cassava, wild mushrooms, and paiche, an Amazon River fish.Fusion: Peruvian cuisine today is a mishmash of European, African, and indigenous influences, but also Chinese and Japanese influences, as well. Chinese and Japanese immigrants started moving to Peru in large numbers in the 19th century, forming communities from which emerged the Cantonese-Peruvian cuisine Chifa and its Japanese-Peruvian counterpart, Nikkei. Chef Félix Loo pushes traditional Chifa into new territory at Madam Tusan. At Maido, in Miraflores, chef Micha Tsumura riffs on the natural pairing of Japanese and Peruvian cuisines—think ceviche meets sashimi—with lauded results.Onlookers appear in silhouette as they enjoy a fountain in Park of the Reserve in Lima, Peru.Streets: For all the abundance of innovative cuisine in Lima, the food isn’t the only thing keeping the city on the cutting edge. The streets of Lima are coming alive again amid a massive construction boom, with new commercial buildings being erected at a breakneck pace. Lima’s famous Park of the Reserve has been revitalized in recent years, with fixes and updates that have given new life to one of the world’s largest water fountain parks, now known as the Magic Water Circuit. Lima’s cultural heritage is on display in the city’s ancient ruins and many museums, but the city celebrates its more recently developed cultural heritage, too. The MATE (Museo Mario Testino) houses a permanent collection of the work of the iconic photographer Mario Testino, who has worked with fashion and society icons including Tom Ford, Madonna, and the British royal family. In the up-and-coming Barranco neighborhood, the Lucía de la Puente Gallery displays the latest and hottest works of Lima’s contemporary artists.",
"Warning: The above film contains scenes which may be disturbing to some viewers.Malek Jandali is no ordinary musician. The Syrian-American composer and pianist has performed in leading concert halls around the world and has also written a song so powerful that his parents were beaten in punishment for its performance.“I can’t think of a more stark example of how threatening art can be,” says Julie Winokur, who helped produce a new film about Jandali called Notes for My Homeland.Born in Germany, and raised in Homs, Syria, Jandali is an American citizen who blends traditional Arab music with Western harmonies. Although now living in the U.S., Jandali’s heart is never far from Syria. His song Watani Ana (I Am My Homeland) was a inspired by the killing of children in the Syrian city of Dara’a. After he performed it during a demonstration in Washington, his parents were attacked in their home in Syria.Notes for My Homeland was produced by Talking Eyes Media in partnership with Rutgers University-Newark and VII photo agency. It’s the first professionally produced piece in a new storytelling project called “Newest Americans: Stories From the Global City,” which is taking an in-depth look at immigration and the idea of American identity.The three-year collaboration between the photo agency, production company, and university is tasked with finding new stories that educate people about immigration. The professional journalists in the group will mentor students at Rutgers-Newark—the university with the most diverse student body in the nation—as they produce their own written and visual journalism. A selection of work will be presented on the website Newest Americans.Notes for My Homeland features Jandali’s story, along with his music, archival video, and photos from Syria, as well as graphic photos of his parents after their attack. It was produced by Winokur and Ed Kashi, with executive production from Tim Raphael, an associate professor of arts, culture, and media at Rutgers-Newark.And, bringing the project full circle, Jandali was first introduced to the Newest Americans project by his oud player, Mohamed Alsiadi, who is also a doctoral student at Rutgers-Newark. They will be performing, along with cello player Laura Metcalf, on January 31 at Carnegie Hall.*****Jandali will present chamber works for piano, cello, and oud, in conjunction with the release of his new album,  Syrian Symphony,  at Carnegie Hall on January 31st.",
"A horse-drawn carriage rests outside the Hofburg palace in Vienna.An interfusion of historical periods and eastern European cultures has made Vienna a melting pot that sits in the very center of Europe.April sees establishments pull their chairs and tables out of winter storage as the arrival of spring brings excitement for al fresco days. These months of cooler weather make for optimal temperatures for exploring with fewer crowds, as do the autumn months of September and October. Summer months can be stifling, but warm sunny weather is guaranteed from June until August when the city sees a spike in visitors. Christmas markets are open in mid-November through the very end of December, when Glühwein and festive celebration make up for the bitter chill.The world-renowned Vienna Philharmonic play an open-air Summer Night Concert every year in May to an audience that fills the park gardens of Schönbrunn Palace with picnics and summer cheer. Street festivals pop up in September where local stores show their wares, restaurants serve street food style, and local bands fill the avenues until late. And, of course, more than 10 Christmas Markets dot the city from mid-November. The Rathaus Christmas market is the most central and touristic, and the hilltop Wilhelminenberg Castle in the district of Ottakring the most offbeat, with an elevated view over the city.One cannot pass through Vienna without sampling the famous pan-fried breaded meat dish it invented—the Wiener Schnitzel. The original version (and the only one that can use this name) is made from veal and best served with a potato salad. It was a Viennese who invented the croissant in a bakery in Paris, derived from the crescent shaped Austrian biscuit, Kipferl. You'll find these in all traditional cafes and bakeries.The pink glazed dough squares (with a dash of rum) known as Viennese Punschkrapfen are a traditional sweet symbol of Vienna, presented in a wooden box to transport home. Many locals enjoy their coffee with a slice of Guglhupf cake, which is also available from the Grand Hotel as a souvenir. For mementos to last, take home a piece of porcelain handcrafted at the Augarten Palace. Austria's most traditional porcelain factory has been in operation for 300 years. 'Golden Vienna Heart' wine glasses, like the ones at traditional Wiener Heurigen (taverns), are a reminder of the vineyard heritage upon which the city is built.Vienna has a great and inexpensive metro and tram infrastructure, so consider these options before driving, which can be difficult for a first-time visitor to navigate. The historic centre of the city (first district) and the inner districts (two through nine) are also easily navigated on foot.An 18th century exquisite structure of columns and arcades sit atop a hill overlooking the manicured gardens of Schönbrunn Palace. The Gloriette was deliberately placed and specifically built for this purpose—for the imperial eye to gaze upon when looking out at the stately backyard. Climb its stairs for a view of the baroque Habsburg imperial summer residence, now considered one of the most important cultural moments in Austria.",
"Pro-democracy students march through Tiananmen Square in Beijing to demand more democratic rule in Communist China.Its name means “gate of heavenly peace,” but in 1989 the iconic gate at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square overlooked a scene that was anything but peaceful. Earlier that year, the square had been the site of non-violent pro-democracy protests. But on June 3 and 4, it became a scene of chaos and devastation as the Chinese military mowed down an unknown number of civilians. In the 30 years since the historic protests, China has rarely acknowledged them—and has never apologized for the massacre.The protest movement began after the death of Hu Yaobang, a Communist Party leader who worked to liberalize Chinese politics, but was ousted from the party in part for his sympathy with pro-democracy students. In the wake of his death from a heart attack, mourning students poured into Tiananmen Square in late April. They began to demand democratic reforms, including an end to press censorship and restrictions on freedom of assembly.Over the next few weeks, the square drew millions of protestors. In response to their ballooning numbers, China imposed martial law in late May and ousted Western reporters. Then, on the night of June 3, the People’s Liberation Army moved in with orders to clear the square.The next day, 200,000 troops and more than 100 tanks converged on Tiananmen Square and opened fire. Soldiers used bayonets, clubs, and rifles loaded with expanding bullets. Although students and residents resisted, they were overwhelmed. (Hear from two photojournalists who are still haunted by the massacre.)The image of “Tank Man,” who briefly stopped a convoy of tanks driving out of Tiananmen Square, has become iconic globally. But the fate of the man remains unknown.The Western world learned of the massacre from smuggled images and secret reports. Among them were videos and photos of Tank Man, an unidentified Chinese man who managed momentarily to stop a convoy of tanks leaving the square on June 5. He is thought to be one of multiple people who attempted to block the tanks. Although his image has become a symbol of resistance, his fate remains unknown.The extent of the massacre is also unknown. The Chinese government stated that 200 civilians were killed; student leaders claim up to 3,400 deaths. In 2017, the United Kingdom released a secret diplomatic cable in which a U.K. diplomat relayed a leaked death count—of at least 10,000— from China’s main administrative body. Some 1,600 people were arrested; it would take 27 years for Miao Deshun, thought to be the final prisoner, to walk free in 2016.An accurate death toll may never come to light. The Chinese government has rarely acknowledged the events; when it does, it is only to defend its actions. Although Tiananmen Square’s Great Hall was added to a list of Chinese architectural sites slated for official preservation, the historic events that took place there are not widely known in China.A Hong Kong museum devoted to the massacre has been repeatedly closed and sabotaged; many of its Chinese visitors arrive knowing nothing about the protests. Those who do sometimes refuse to believe the truth, writes The Atlantic’s Ryan Krull. “Beijing’s refusal to acknowledge the events of June 4, 1989, has created a vacuum into which misinformation, ignorance, and revisionism have been allowed to flow.” Meanwhile, China actively censors most online mentions of the incident, and only Hong Kong and Macau have been allowed to commemorate it publicly.The pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square presented a brief window of hope that China might embrace a more democratic system. “There was a euphoric sense that after decades of tyranny, the Chinese people had found the courage to take full control of their lives and attempt to change the fate of their nation,” recalled London-based Chinese novelist Ma Jian, who attended the protests. “Every person in that crowd was later a victim of the massacre, whether they lost their life on June 4 or survived—their ideals shattered and their soul scarred by fear.”Now, 31 years after the protests and massacre, China has banned a commemoration vigil in Hong Kong that has taken place since the 1990s. Although the official reason for the ban was to quell the further spread of COVID-19, pro-democracy activists see it as another attempt to quash peaceful protest as China tightens its grip on Hong Kong. Thousands attended the vigil anyway, as the BBC reports. Three decades after Tiananmen Square, commemorating what happened there has become its own form of protest.",
"A scheduled reporting trip to China for Peter Turnley turned into months-long coverage of historic protests. "This is early morning, hours after the Chinese government declared martial law," Peter said.David Turnley was in Paris when he got the call. His brother Peter was in Beijing to cover the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to China but was on the line with different, more exciting news. A small group of students had taken to the streets in protest in Tiananmen Square—and their numbers were swelling."I think something is happening here," Peter told his brother. You need to cover this too, Peter urged.What had started with a handful of students "soon turned into 10,000, and a few days after that, a million," recalls Peter, all in support of greater political and personal freedoms. The year 1989 was a time of historic change in entrenched political systems like the Soviet Union and South Africa, and the Chinese students wanted to be part of it.David flew out to cover the events as well, and as he walked among the million or more protesters who soon filled Tiananmen Square, "there was a sense of an elevated human spirit," he says. "It was euphoric."That euphoria did not last long. The People's Liberation Army was massing outside the city. The photographers followed some of the students as they traveled to the convoys to beg them not to interfere. When the army did crack down, David and Peter were there to photograph the brutal events and the generalized fear that followed.Both have photographed many of the world's wars and uprisings over the past 30 years, but Tiananmen stands out as profoundly affecting, both professionally and personally. Both say they were honored to have witnessed the courage of the students of Tiananmen, and they are still shaped by it 25 years later."These events were much greater than the work of any one person," says Peter. "I can never forget the setback Tiananmen Square represented for me in my own heart. I still to this day feel the scars of those events."A young woman paints a sign for the mass protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. Students occupied the square for over a month to demand social and political reforms, but the long protest ended in violence when the government ordered troops to fire on the students and crushed the uprising. University campuses, says Turnley "were the pulse and infrastructure of the movement."More than 300,000 Chinese students and workers protested in Tiananmen Square asking for greater freedom and democracy in China on May 15, the day Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited Deng Xiaoping in the Great Hall of the People. Turnley, assigned to film that historic meeting, was unable to reach the hall and decided to photograph the people instead. "The people in the streets were more important than the handshake."A demonstrator reads aloud from the hood of a military truck as students tried to stop the Chinese military from entering Beijing the day that Martial law was declared on May 20. "Up until that point the people had an appreciation and sense of closeness with the military," says Turnley. "I believe that the students very strongly felt that the People's Army would take side with their cause."A young student protestor in Tiananmen Square wears a sign written in English, which reads: I love life, I need food, but I'd rather die [than live] without democracy. "What struck me every day in these early weeks was not so much the connection to their specific demands, but what one encountered walking among these millions," says Turnley, "a generalized youthful passion for greater freedoms and a better life."On the afternoon of June 3, 1989, thousands of Chinese troops entered the city to retake control of Tiananmen Square and crush the student uprising. In this photograph, one of the students attempts to mobilize the students to stand their ground against the soldiers. "There was a sense of inevitability by now, but it reminded me of the deep South: Lock arms, stay strong, and we shall overcome."On the afternoon of June 3, as thousands of Chinese troops rolled into the heart of Beijing, the mother of one of the students begs a young soldier to put down his arms. "So many of these soldiers were peers of the students, trucked in from the provinces," says Turnley. "The mother was saying, 'These are your dreams as well, turn back.' I think the soldiers had no idea what they were mixed up in and were in shock."In the middle of the night of June 3-4, the Chinese army used tanks and foot soldiers to force the students from Tiananmen Square. Refusing to leave, they massed on nearby Changan Avenue, standing in rows to face the army's machine guns. "Every 15 minutes the Chinese would go to the lines and mow down the front row of students," says Turnley. "The first row would go down, then they would collect the bodies, move them to the rear, and a new line was formed." To this day it is unclear whether hundreds or thousands were killed as the students sacrificed themselves. "They did this until daybreak, until they realized their day in history was over."Family members try to comfort a grief-stricken mother who has just learned of the death of her son, a student protester killed by soldiers at Tiananmen Square on June 4. "The next day we went to the morgue. The families had no idea what had happened, and this mother just discovered her child had been killed." In the days that followed, says Turnley, fear set in and few Chinese dared to speak to foreign photographers. "The power of the repression was so full-scale, it managed to put down not just their dreams. It was absolutely soul crushing for me, and still is, frankly."Two students grieve for their friends and their dreams in the early hours of June 4. Says Turnley: "I think the Chinese have a long sense of history. That day didn't unfold just in the history of China, but of the world. I want to pay tribute to these students, it was a tremendous sacrifice they made. It was an honor to be a part of it."Mangled bicycles hang from the side of a Chinese army tank, which was burned by student protesters as it tried to enter the square in the midst of what would soon be called the Tiananmen Square massacre. It is unclear whether the bicycles were hit or were positioned in protest. After the massacre, the streets became silent, recalls Turnley. "It was a treacherous time—we didn't know if it was an official policy or not, but journalists and photographers were told we had no right to be in the streets reporting." They went anyway.Beijing citizens survey the damage on the day after the massacre. "You see on people's faces a very discreet curiosity—they are trying to figure out what had just happened the previous night," says Turnley. Citizens who had been open and friendly were now afraid. "The atmosphere changed completely. No one would look you in the eye or speak to you." To this day, Chinese who try to discuss or memorialize the events face a clampdown on information and risk imprisonment.David Turnley (on right) and Peter Turnley (on left) document the student movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Read about photographer Stuart Franklin's experience in Tiananmen Square on Proof.Do you have pictures of Tiananmen Square?

"Snowcapped Mount Fuji casts a bright spot on the frozen surface of Lake Yamanaka. The 12,388-foot (3,776-meter) volcano, which last erupted almost 300 years ago, is for the Japanese an enduring national symbol of serenity and strength. On a clear day, the iconic peak can be seen from Tokyo, 70 miles (112 kilometers) away.",
"Celebrations like the Ungami Festival, held at Shioya Bay and devoted to the god of the sea, bring the community of Ogimi together. A robust social system is said to help residents live longer.In the village of Ogimi, located in the rural north of Okinawa’s main island, there’s a small stone marker with a few sentences written in Japanese. Roughly translated, they read: “At 80, you are merely a youth. At 90, if your ancestors invite you into heaven, ask them to wait until you are 100—then, you might consider it.”That’s not bluster. At the latest count, 15 of Ogimi’s 3,000 villagers are centenarians. One hundred and seventy-one are in their 90s. Even in Japan, which currently has more than 70,000 people aged 100 or over, that’s a remarkable statistic.Haru Miyagi, a widow whose husband died during World War II, is 100 years old and has a son who works in Tokyo.Miyagi is one of several centenarians who live in Ogimi, the “village of longevity.”Before COVID-19, travelers were beginning to take notice. Masataka Nozato at Ogimi Village Office says the town, far removed from the tourist trail, had started to see a slight increase in visitors curious about Okinawan longevity.An island located south of mainland Japan, Okinawa is one of five places around the world that author and National Geographic explorer Dan Buettner calls a “blue zone,” where he says people live the longest, happiest lives. Others include Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California. Though travel to Okinawa and any blue zone is on hold for many, these towns offer lessons about surviving and thriving during difficult times, such as a pandemic.“Every longevity culture in the world suffered periods of hardships,” Buettner told TODAY. “They went through wars, famines, the same sorts of stresses that we’re suffering right now, and that’s a lesson for all of us.”Misako Miyagi, 88, is “merely a youth,” according to a saying in Ogimi, where there is a high concentration of centenarians.What can Okinawans tell us? Why does Ogimi and elsewhere on the island have a history of long life? That comes down to three main factors—diet, social practices, and genetics—explains Craig Willcox, a professor of public health and gerontology at Okinawa International University and a co-principal investigator of the Okinawa Centenarian Study, which has been investigating Okinawan longevity since 1975.“About two-thirds of longevity is related to diet and way of life, the rest is genetics. Generally speaking, you need the genetic rocket booster if you want to get into the hundreds, not just a good diet,” Willcox says. “We haven’t looked into whether or not Okinawa has a genetic advantage over other parts of Japan, but longevity does run in families here.”Genetics aside, diet more easily identifies how locals stand apart. If you go to a typical Okinawa-themed restaurant in Tokyo or a touristy one in Okinawa, the menu is pork heavy and the alcohol is as strong as it gets in Japan. Awamori, the fiery regional spirit, weighs in at an ABV of 40 percent. But that’s not representative of island habits.Chouju-zen, or “longevity food,” is nutritionally dense yet light in calories, which some say contributes to long life.As priestesses, elderly women in Ogimi have important roles in the Ungami Festival. They engage in rituals, such as tea ceremonies, and pray to ensure a bountiful harvest for their village.(Related: Here’s the ultimate three-day itinerary for exploring Tokyo.)In terms of preventing cancer and cardiovascular disease, the Okinawan diet gives more than five servings a day of fruits and vegetables and incorporates more heart-healthy fish than meat, says Willcox.“There’s an Okinawan phrase, nuchi gusui, which can translate as ‘let food be your medicine,’” he notes. “The sweet potatoes, bitter melon, carotenoid-rich marine foods like seaweeds, green leafy vegetables, and fruit in the diet are anti-aging as they reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.”“The traditional Okinawan diet is also nutritionally dense, yet calorie poor, and that’s ideal,” Willcox continues, adding that sweet potato rather than white rice was the staple in Okinawa up until the 1960s.“If you calorie-restrict mammals in a lab, they live longer pretty much across the board,” he says. “A persistent energy deficit triggers a self-preservation mode—you adapt to convert a higher proportion of food into usable energy and turn on enzymes that promote longevity.”Residents in Naha, Okinawa, also tend to enjoy long lives filled with social outings.Life on the islands is different from much of the rest of Japan. The climate is sub-tropical, with mild winters. Okinawans live amid scenic island beauty and have a reputation for being mellow; the laidback approach to punctuality here is known as “Okinawa time.”Society is structured so older residents retain purpose, or ikigai, in their lives. Giving some in Ogimi an ikigai is the local craft of weaving basho-fu textiles, where the time-intensive cleaning of fibers and spooling of thread is done by groups of older women. It’s not just a way to remain socially active; it gives the weavers a way to supplement their income and contribute to the village economy. Naturally, the basho-fu center is run by a 98-year-old from a family full of centenarians.In Ogimi, nature abounds, offering stress-free living amid scenic beauty.Then there’s the way society stresses mutual support through moai. This Okinawan social mechanism brings groups of people with a shared interest together, allowing them to develop emotional connections. Buettner says that’s a crucial element to living a long life, noting that “loneliness is as bad for you as smoking.”Takashi Inafuku, head of one of Ogimi’s districts, belongs to two moai—one with a group of school friends and another with former co-workers. “They are places where you can exchange information and communicate with others,” he says. “I think that participating in moai, having a common hobby and releasing stress, can help promote longevity.”(Related: Read more about Okinawa’s secret to long life.)Willcox notes that belonging to multiple moai is common. “I know one man in Ogimi who is in seven,” he says. “And people are loyal to their moai; I met a group of 80-year-old women on an outlying island who had been in a moai together since they were in elementary school. I’m in one, too—our common interest is slow food.”That support and stress release is especially important during these pandemic times. With 2,740 COVID-19 cases in Okinawa as of October 12, many moai are adapting. The new moai normal emphasizes face masks, hand sanitizers, and avoiding what the government calls the “three Cs” (closed spaces, close contact settings, and crowded places).In addition to the precautions, some moai are going online and maybe even global. The term moai is spreading outside Japan to community initiatives, such as neighborhood walking groups and virtual club meetings that help people stay in touch.Other ideas include taking a language class for future travel and joining an online dance class. Sites like Beach Cities Health District’s free online moai starter kit offers a guide for launching a moai on any common interest—blue zone food or awamori appreciation included.",
"In Harajuku, along a road that leads to the Meiji Shrine, Tokyo shoppers now pay their respects at Tokyu Plaza mall.2:47 a.m. I arrive early at Tsukiji Market, the largest wholesale fish market in the world [now relocated to nearby Toyosu in 2018]. For the high-stakes tuna auction, bidding begins at 5.30 a.m., and only 120 visitors are allowed to watch. Tsukiji (pronounced skee-gee) attracts 40,000 shoppers daily but wasn’t designed to be a tourist attraction; forklifts whiz by in tight alleyways, and one of the fishmongers actually gives us the middle finger—the Japanese equivalent of “I’m walkin’ here!” A buyer tells me about the most expensive tuna ever sold: a $1.76 million bluefin auctioned in 2013. At 5.20 a.m. we are ushered into a hangar where licenced buyers examine the fish. The whole thing feels like the floor of the New York Stock Exchange; a bell rings and men start shouting numbers and barking into cell phones. What jet lag?A woman dressed as a chondara, a traditional clown from the Japanese island of Okinawa, participates in one of Tokyo’s many street festivals.6:12 a.m. Compact sushi counters surround Tsukiji. While I wait 30 minutes for a seat at Daiwa Sushi, I get the skinny on Tsukiji’s long-delayed move to a modern facility, a transition mired in corruption accusations. Once seated, I ask the chef about the impending move as he serves me pieces of sea urchin and skipjack. “Next year,” he grunts. “Really?” I say. The safest bet: definitely before the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.7:53 a.m. Full and happy, I check in to Hoshinoya, a modern ryokan, or Japanese inn, in the center of Tokyo. I change into a kimono, then make my way to the hot spring–fed baths on the 17th floor. This is a retreat like no other—a dimly lit pool with an open-air skylight, where you can get naked and soak to the soundtrack of the city.11:32 a.m. The Tokyo train system is a marvel of efficiency and affordability in a city where taxis are stupid-expensive. I take the Chiyoda line to the Meiji-jingumae stop—admiring a businessman with his Samsonite luggage and Hello Kitty cell phone case on the way—and walk over to the Harajuku neighborhood, once the epicenter of forward-thinking fashion co-opted by Gwen Stefani and others, now the best place for people-watching. Teenagers eat rainbow-colored clouds of cotton candy, and women carry umbrellas to avoid getting a tan. Harajuku’s newish trend: cat cafés. For about a $10 entrance fee, you get a cup of coffee and 30 minutes playing with adorable kittens that tussle with each other and nap on your lap.3:13 p.m. It’s off-season for sumo wrestling, but I luck out: There’s an all-day exhibition tournament of the yokozuna—the grand champions—in an arena in the center of the city, including an appearance by Hakuho Sho, a 32-year-old Mongolian superhero who holds the record for most career wins. When Hakuho first arrived in Tokyo, at age 15, he was so small no sumo “stable,” or training facility, would take him in; now he’s the Greatest of All Time. The main rule of sumo seems to be: Push your competitor out of the ring. The men square off, pulling the tassels around their waists to the side, and then slap their thighs. Actually I have no idea what’s going on. The last match of the day is a nail-biter: As his winning move, Hakuho somehow lifts up his 293-pound opponent and drops him outside the ring like a rag doll.At a one-day sumo exhibition, top-ranked wrestlers dressed in ceremonial kesho-mawashi (aprons) start each bout with formalized rituals.5:23 p.m. I follow the Japanese salarymen to Omoide Yokocho, nicknamed Piss Alley, a series of narrow, winding alleyways lined with yakitori joints beside the train tracks in Shinjuku. I pick a spot that looks the most fun, sliding open a glass door to Ucchan, which has 15 seats and as many people smoking. The bartender flips the menu over to the English side, which promises—for 1,650 yen (or about $15)—“6 kinds of Japanese skewered pork and beer set,” featuring “giblets, innards & organ meat etc.” I’m alarmed by the use of “etc.” But each stick is spiced to perfection.10:30 p.m. Kampai! That’s Japanese for “cheers!” Here’s another phrase I learned: nomikai. Which is a uniquely Japanese phrase that basically translates to “forced fun.” Or team drinking. If the boss takes the office out for drinks, you can’t go home until he does. For nomikai, there’s no better experience than the Golden Gai, a series of six snug Shinjuku alleyways packed with more than 200 Barbie-size bars—four-stool watering holes, including maybe the world’s smallest karaoke bar. From an architectural standpoint, it’s a time capsule view of old Tokyo. It’s also bonkers fun. At a locals-only place called Oku Tei, the bartender charges me a $10 cover. I don’t blame her. Everyone is trying to keep the Golden Gai real.8:23 a.m. As I’m exiting the train station, an elderly Japanese man carrying a large satchel shuffles by, smiles at me, and says loudly: “I love you.” He lets out a belly laugh and shuffles away. I have to pause to catch my breath. I flew to Tokyo from my home in L.A. on the one-year anniversary of my father’s death. On paper my dad and I didn’t have much in common. He was a gym teacher who liked routine; he ate pasta practically every night for dinner; he hated traveling. I’m a gay travel writer who just ate raw fish for breakfast, again. Whenever I was away on assignment, I’d call to tell him about some surprising thing I’d seen. All I wanted this morning—every morning—was to be able to call him. I’m not saying this old Japanese guy was some celestial incarnation of my dad or anything. Probably he spotted a hopeless white guy and decided to practice the only three words he knew in English. But still.Video gamers head to Club Sega in Akihabara for virtual reality games such as Mortal Blitz.9:55 a.m. The Japanese word otaku means “fanatic,” or rather “obsession,” to the point that you can’t see how it’s ruining your social skills. Everyone in Tokyo seems to be video game-otaku. In Akihabara, or Electric Town—with its seven-story arcades and used-electronics stores—I visit Club Sega to play a virtual reality game called Mortal Blitz, which is the best $15 I’ve ever spent. You put on a backpack and VR gloves and walk to your starting position on the arcade floor. Pick up your rifle, put on the VR goggles, and—bam!—you’re standing on a spaceship battling winged aliens. How real does it feel? At one point, staring down into a digital abyss, I had to take the glasses off so I didn’t puke.10:46 a.m. Beneath every building seems to be a shopping mall and food court.Indie shops fill Takeshita Street, in Harajuku, ground zero for youthful kawaii (cute) fashion.11:12 a.m. When I was 12, we had a garage sale where—against my father’s wishes—I sold my favorite toy for $15. It was a hefty metal robot called Voltron that starred in a Japanese cartoon I watched dubbed in English. I spend an hour roaming Akihabara’s manga toy stores looking for my Voltron in his birthplace. “Very rare,” one shopkeeper tells me, directing me to multistory vintage-toy shop Mandarake, where, between rows of ancient Godzilla toys and Hot Wheels, I find an original Voltron set from the ’80s, still sealed in its box, for $400. My dad was pissed that I’d sold Voltron, but he’d turn over in his grave if I paid $400 to get it back. Not when I could meet a real robot at …3:13 p.m. …Tokyo’s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, where Honda’s ASIMO demonstrates its talents four times daily. The four-foot-three robot runs into the pavilion at full speed. He waves to the crowd, which is frankly the creepiest thing I’ve ever seen—until he flat-out kicks a soccer ball. “Robots may change your life,” says the announcer. Which is what I’m afraid of. I ask one of the museum’s resident nerds, Matt Escobar, Ph.D.: “When will the robots take over?” He doesn’t laugh. “Hopefully never. But I think in 20 or 30 years they will be very smart.”Step into the future with interactive robots, such as Honda’s ASIMO, at Tokyo’s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.6:32 p.m. Star Bar and High Five are both killer temples of mixology, but I’m partial to Gen Yamamoto—which is the name for both the bartender and his eight-seat, one-room space, where he mixes up sake and soju cocktails with seasonal ingredients picked daily at the market. For one drink, muddled fresh tomatoes mix with Japanese Nikka Coffey gin, local citrus, and peppercorns. It’s maybe the most delightful summer sip I’ve ever had.Midnight Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation is a perfect movie about a special kind of loneliness one experiences in Tokyo, a gorgeous anonymity in a city where people are stacked on top of each other. In the film, Scarlett Johansson follows her photographer husband to Tokyo, and while he’s busy working, she wanders around town, ultimately meeting Bill Murray at the New York Bar on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt hotel, which is where I go tonight. Looking out the window at the insane views of Tokyo’s endless skyscape, I also spy a dozen tourists glued to their iPhones—which makes the film even more of a perfect time capsule. Would Scarlett’s character have met Bill if she’d soothed her loneliness with an iPhone?10:30 a.m. Brian MacDuckston left his Bay Area tech job to teach English in Tokyo. But 10 years later his one-year adventure threatens to become something more permanent now that his blog, Ramen Adventures, has turned into a local institution. “Real ramen nerds eat 600 bowls a year,” he tells me. He eats 300. But the dude’s legit. He once hosted his own local TV show where he and the women of AKB48 (basically Japan’s Spice Girls) would go around town tasting ramen. The concierge at the Palace Hotel (a contemporary retreat with impressive views of the Imperial Palace gardens) arranges a tour for me with Brian, and we set out to hunt ramen. We hit Ginza Noodles for the triple ramen (which refers to three broths—dashi, chicken, and clam, plus some aromatic oils). With good ramen, Brian explains, you should experience “salt right off the bat, then a smooth, umami aftertaste.” At Kikanbo (recommended by Noma chef René Redzepi), droplets of pork-back fat float in a spicy broth. A woman next to me orders the Devil Spice ramen—made with Trinidadian scorpion peppers and served in a black bowl—but barely breaks a sweat.12:58 p.m. Entering Meiji Shrine is like walking into Tokyo’s natural air-conditioning; the city is steamy in the summer, but a canopy of camphor trees covers the park-like entrance, offering cool shade. A girl sells prayer charms, and they’re very specific. “A charm for traffic safety.” “A charm for passing an entrance examination,” which would have made my dad laugh. I may have run away from memories, but I see him everywhere.Visitors make offerings at the Senso-ji Temple, in Asakusa.4:11 p.m. Overstimulation can be a problem in Tokyo. So I spend most of today being quiet, trying to listen to my own heartbeat. Tokyo may be a concrete jungle, but there’s still some tropical scenery—if you know where to look. Next to Meiji Shrine is Yoyogi Park. Even more peaceful is the garden at Nezu Museum, designed by Kengo Kuma, the architect behind Tokyo’s new Olympic stadium. Nezu Museum has premodern Japanese and East Asian art (including priceless Buddhist statues), but the garden’s the thing. It’s like you fell asleep next to a bonsai tree and woke up in an enchanted forest. I inhale deeply and smell something sweet. “A mosquito coil,” my guide says, laughing. “To kill bugs.” Everything is beautiful.6:13 p.m. English isn’t widely spoken in Tokyo, and I don’t speak Japanese, so I’ve made do with sign language—which connects you to people in a deeper, often hilarious way. I’m dripping in sweat while riding the train back to the hotel when I notice a woman, probably in her mid-50s, wiping her brow with a handkerchief before handing the rag to her daughter. The mother and I make eye contact, and I mime dabbing my forehead, as if to say, “Me next?” She laughs.Ascend the 2,080-foot Tokyo Skytree, the world’s tallest freestanding tower, for a panorama of this Asian megacity, home to 13 million residents.8:29 p.m. For a decade, Chef Harutaka Takahashi apprenticed under famed sushi chef Jiro Ono (of the acclaimed documentary film Jiro Dreams of Sushi) before opening his own Michelin-starred spot, Harutaka, in Ginza. Like so many of the best things in Tokyo, you have to know where to look. Harutaka hides on the sixth floor of a nondescript office building. The elevator doors open on a brightly lit sushi bar with 10 seats. Guests are instructed not to wear perfume. Plates start arriving almost immediately after diners are seated: conger eel, otoro (superfatty tuna), tobiko (roe). We watch the chef’s number two slice a delicate fish with a sword. I ask Chef Takahashi what the secret is to his sushi. He hunts for the fish himself, he explains, emphasizing the need for the highest quality from Tsukiji Market. But the real secret, he says, is the “vinegar in the rice.”Tokyo’s tuna auction has moved from Tsukiji to Toyosu, but you still need to get up early to catch the action.11:32 p.m. Running out of steam but not wanting to go to bed, I hop a cab to hip Ebisu. As the streetlights pass by, I think of Haruki Murakami’s novel After Dark and this great line about Tokyo at night: “Time moves in its own special way in the middle of the night. You can’t fight it.” I visit a different kind of shrine, Bar Martha, one of a string of vinyl-music bars popping up in Tokyo. The joint is easy to miss; a blank cinder block wall and a sign marked BAR are the only indications something is happening here. But step inside, and you’ll find thousands of LPs beautifully shelved and a chill DJ spinning records on a serious stereo system. No photos, no requests. And no worries. Just top-shelf Japanese whiskey and Joni Mitchell reminding me that, yes, “California, I’m coming home.” We can escape from the everyday for only so long.Ultimate View At 2,080 feet, Tokyo Skytree is the tallest freestanding tower in the world, and—on a clear day—you can see all the way to Mount Fuji from the observation deck on the 350th floor. (A high-speed elevator climbs a staggering 1,150 feet in just 50 seconds.) Feeling more daring? Take a second elevator up to the Tembo Galleria on the 450th floor. When you’re back on Earth, hop on the Japan Rail train one stop to the renowned Asakusa Shrine, where you can thank god—or rather, its three Shinto gods—for your safe return.Cool-Kid Neighborhood Shimokitazawa is a quick train ride from Shibuya and a much needed respite from the madness of central Tokyo. You’ll notice the narrow streets and alleyways here are lined with dogwood trees; in 1912 the mayor of Tokyo gave Washington, D.C., a gift of cherry blossom trees, and D.C. sent dogwoods in return. Here you’ll browse an eclectic mix of vintage stores, shop for tea at Shimokita Chaen Oyama, and enjoy a cake doughnut made with soy milk at Ikkyu Donut before sipping a cocktail at Flower Bar Gardena (a flower shop that doubles as a watering hole).Best Bespoke Goods At Kakimori—a chic, local stationery store that’s walking distance from Asakusa Station—customers queue at opening to make their own bespoke notebooks. Choose the cover, the paper insert, and binding, and watch a master craftsman put it all together before your eyes.

But nearby, on the second floor of a residential building in Jingumae, lies Ichirin, a kaiseki ryori (or Japanese fine dining) restaurant, where Chef Mikizo Hashimoto changes the seasonal menu every 10 days. Chef Hashimoto was raised in Kyoto, the birthplace of kaiseki. The meal involves a parade of nine or 10 small plates, which always include a simmered fish, a sashimi dish, hassun (an expression of the season), and a grilled course. Here at Ichirin, the chef follows tradition but also breaks the rules. Yuzu shrimp is followed by a zucchini spiral, then squid and edible shiso flower and eel soup and a plate of bite-size morsels (eggplant, crab, fish eggs, jellyfish, squash), all chased with the most delicious mochi dessert (a gelatinous rice cake). The chef’s father was an art director, which makes sense—each dish is Instagram ready. The chef also hand-paints the drinks menu on a washi paper scroll, which you should take home and frame.DEN Zaiyu Hasegawa is the Michelin-starred chef behind the modern kaiseki fusion spot DEN, which was named one of the top 50 restaurants in the coveted Asia’s 50 Best list, thanks to standout dishes like a whole freshwater smelt deep-fried in tempura batter and balanced on its back fins so it looks like it’s walking across the plate. When I asked Chef Hasegawa where he likes to eat in Tokyo when he isn’t working, he doesn’t hesitate: “Shake Shack in Aoyama, as it is close to our restaurant. I order a triple burger, and I can go with my dog, Puchi, Jr., as he can eat his dog biscuits too!” He isn’t joking. In 2017 he collaborated with Shake Shack in New York’s Madison Square Park on a one-day-only signature burger, the DEN Shack, which featured miso Shack sauce, sansho peppers, and house-pickled cucumbers.Tsuta There are a whopping 227 Michelin-starred restaurants in Tokyo alone. But Tsuta was the first ever ramen shop to earn that honor. Up early? Head over and take a number.

"Cats associate their names with rewards, such as food and petting.Cats know many things: how to catch mice, what the sound of the can opener means, and even how to take over the internet.But the one question cat expert Atsuko Saito always gets is whether cats recognize their own names, an ability that's well known in dogs.In a new study in the journal Scientific Reports, the psychologist at Tokyo’s Sophia University showed that they do know their names—even when called by a stranger.Cats are Saito’s favorite animal, and after studying primate cognition in graduate school, she set her research sights on the oft-misunderstood pets. (Is everything you think about cats wrong?)“I love cats. They’re so cute and so selfish. When they want to be touched, they’ll come by me, but when they want to be left alone, they’ll just leave,” she says, laughing.Her past experiments have revealed cats can interpret human gestures to find hidden food, recognize their owner’s voice, and beg for food from a person who looks at them and calls their name—all of which suggested that felines know their names.Saito and colleagues tested this hypothesis by observing a total of 78 housecats and felines living in cat cafés in Japan.In the homes and cafés, the researchers asked both owners and strangers to call a cat’s name, and then videotaped responses that would indicate recognition, such as ear and head movements and tail swishing.In a series of four different experiments, the team discovered cats showed a meaningful response to their own names—even after hearing four similar-sounding nouns or the names of other cats living in the home or the cat café. (Read how to properly train your cat.)The cats showed interest not only when their owners called their names, but even when strangers did.It’s possible cats may have learned to pair the sound of their name with rewards, such as food and petting, Saito explains.“It was a really well-done study,” says Jennifer Vonk, a cognitive psychologist at Oakland University in Michigan who wasn’t involved in the research. (Learn surprising things you never knew about your cat.)Vonk has done a similar, anecdotal experiment with her own cats, in which her husband says all sorts of silly names in a sing-song voice to see if the pets respond. And they usually don’t.Even though the cats’ responses weren’t as enthusiastic as those of dogs, Saito notes that canines are literally born to respond to their names.For centuries, people have selectively bred dogs to be obedient and responsive. Cats, on the other hand, pretty much domesticated themselves when wildcats followed mice and rats into agricultural settlements. Not only that, but domestic dogs have a 20,000-year headstart over cats.A Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) sits primly on the shore of Loon Lake in Ontario, Canada in 1906. These 11- to 37-pound (5 to 17 kilogram) cats live in boreal forests across Canada and down into the northern United States.Also, one of the first things dogs learn in obedience school is how to answer to their name, which in turn makes them easier to work with and socialize.“We’re always taking dogs out for walks and introducing them to new people. And you can easily train dogs with treats and other rewards,” Vonk notes.“You bring cats to the lab, and they just freeze.”Saito notes domestic cats are still evolving—thanks to us.Until a decade or two ago, most pet cats spent most of their time outside, coming indoors only at night or in bad weather. (See our favorite photos of pet felines.)With more and more cats spending their lives inside, in closer contact with humans, a cat’s ability to read and respond to our cues may become even stronger.“Social evolution is an ongoing process,” Saito concludes.",
"For those who’ve long wondered if their cats regard them merely as kibble dispensers, a report in the journal Behavioural Processes should be reassuring. In a study that exposed adult cats to four categories of stimuli—food, toy, scent, and human social interaction—the majority of cats preferred human interaction over all other options, even food.This type of research “was done on dogs in the ’90s” but not on cats until now, says Oregon State University’s Kristyn Vitale Shreve, a co-author of the study. “We’re trying to catch up.” Cats are stereotyped in the U.S. as untrainable and unsocial, she says, but they can be taught using the same general principles as dogs—so long as the incentives are right. Vitale’s next study will research how to use cats’ preferences to train them.What else don’t we know about cats? For instance, is the kitten in this photograph scared or playful? (Answer: It’s leaping at a toy dangling in front of the camera.) Cat emotions are notoriously hard to decipher: A new study in Italy by veterinary scientists found that most owners don’t recognize the range of signals cats use to show stress. “Dog owners know more about dog behavior,” says author Chiara Mariti. In contrast, cat owners often interpret their pets’ behavior as normal to the species, rather than a signal about how they’re doing.Scientists are working hard to solve such feline mysteries. Last year a Swedish university launched a five-year study into human-cat communication. The goal: to see if cats react to different ways humans speak to them, and to translate meows into emotions and desires.Independent Streak When dogs and cats were tasked with solving a puzzle, a study in the Journal of Comparative Psychology found, dogs looked to humans for help with an impossible task while cats kept trying on their own.Cat Transit By analyzing mitochondrial DNA in the remains of some 200 ancient cats, researchers in France found that felines spread across the world first with farmers from the Fertile Crescent and then with sailors trading around the globe.",
"Cherry blossoms line the Tidal Basin near the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.Springtime in Washington, D.C. kicks off every year with the city's famous Cherry Blossom Festival, when the fluffy pink cherry trees around the National Mall and Tidal Basin burst into bloom. Hundreds of thousands flock there to take in the beautiful flowers, making it one of Washington's most well-loved events. It's hard to imagine, but more than a century ago, this same area in D.C. stood naked without a cherry tree in site.The story of cherry trees made their way to the U.S. is almost as remarkable as the blossoms themselves, and it might never have happened if not for a handful of unlikely adventurers and advocates.Surrounded by blooming cherry blossom trees and the serene Lake Kawaguchiko, Dungo captured the majestic beauty of Mt. Fuji, one of Japan’s most scared mountains.At a time when American agriculture was as colorful as dirt, a food hunter for the USDA named David Fairchild went in search of novel plants that could be of economic value to U.S. farmers. Driven by curiosity and fueled by optimism, he brought back many plants and fruits now taken for granted, such as mangoes from India, peaches from China, and avocados from Chile.In 1902 Fairchild first encountered sakura, the flowering cherry trees of Japan. Enchanted by their beauty, Fairchild wanted to bring the trees back home and ordered 125 sakura trees for his own front yard in Chevy Chase, Maryland.The nursery owner in Yokohama was so pleased to have an American customer that they charged Fairchild just 10 cents per tree. In the spring of 1906 Fairchild’s imported trees bloomed for the first time, and word of the pink blossoms brought so many onlookers to their home that Fairchild ordered 300 more as a gift to the city of Chevy Chase.Eliza Scidmore, National Geographic’s first official female writer, photographer, and board member, was also an advocate of the cherry blossoms in D.C. After spending time living and reporting from Japan, she returned to Washington with photographs of cherry blossom trees— “the most beautiful thing in the world” —and began petitioning President Grover Cleveland’s administration to plant them along the Tidal Basin. (Read about the life and times of Eliza Scidmore.)Years later, President Theodore Roosevelt spoke often about “beautifying” the country’s capital, then sloppy with mud from the lapping Potomac. Helen Taft, the first lady, believed the cherry blossoms were the answer. Her husband agreed. In addition to their beauty, President William Taft also sensed an opportunity to forge a diplomatic friendship with the Japanese.In the fall of 1909, the mayor of Tokyo sent 2,000 young trees to Washington. However, they arrived barely alive—their roots cut too short and teeming with insects. Fearful of foreign pests, USDA entomologists burned them in a great bonfire on the National Mall. Only when Japan sent a second, bigger shipment of 3,020 trees, all tall and mature, did the trees make it into the ground.On March 27, 1912, Mrs. Taft broke dirt during a private ceremony in West Potomac Park near the banks of the Potomac River. The wife of the Japanese ambassador was invited to plant the second tree. Fairchild took a shovel not long after and participated in the event. (Discover the best places to see cherry blossoms in the U.S.)It took only two springs for the trees to become universally adored by the American public, at least enough for the U.S. government to reciprocate and send Japan a gift in return. Officials decided to offer Japan a shipment of flowering dogwoods, native to the United States, with bright white blooms.Most of the original trees are gone. Sakura tend to survive about 25 years, 50 if they’re lucky, longer if it’s a miracle. Of the original 3,020, only two remain, grizzled and sagging, near the base of the Washington Monument next to a plaque commemorating the day, March 27, 1912, they were planted.",

"Thousands of people gather in Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, Tokyo, to picnic under blooming cherry blossom trees during Japan's annual flower-viewing celebration.Every spring a tapestry of pink blooms blankets the island nation of Japan, starting in the south and crawling northward. Cherry trees, or sakura, symbolize the evanescence of human life in Japanese culture—their blossoms are both brilliant and brief.In Tokyo, urban dwellers emerge from their homes and offices to take pause underneath the fleeting bloom, their daylong celebrations stretching into the night.“They serve as a visual reminder of how precious and how precarious life is,” says photographer Albert Bonsfills, who captured the exuberant spirit of hanami, one of Japan’s oldest and most revered traditions.A young couple embraces underneath a flurry of pink blooms.Hanami, or flower-viewing celebrations, date back to the 9th century when Japanese emperors held viewing parties with their courts. According to folklore, the mountain deity traveled to rice paddies on floating cherry blossom petals and nurtured the crop. Thus, a long bloom became synonymous with a fruitful harvest. Because of this relationship to rice—which sustained human life—the tree was regarded as sacred. They decorated the armor of samurai, were tucked into the elaborately folded hairstyles of geisha, and graced the scrolls of poets.But the symbolism behind Japan’s most iconic flower is complex and mutable. As the country underwent internal and external transformation, the cherry blossom’s meaning also evolved.A man pauses to watch twirling cherry blossom petals fall from the trees.Falling petals—once a quotidian symbol of birth, death, and rebirth—transformed into a nationalist icon during Japanese colonial expansion. In 1912, Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States as a gesture of friendship and political alliance. They were planted along the Tidal Basin in Washington D.C., which now shares the yearly blossom-viewing tradition.During World War II the flower was once again reborn as a military symbol. Tokkotai (kamikaze) pilots took to the skies with branches affixed to their uniforms and a single blossom painted on each side of their planes: A motif of their final flight and sacrifice to the emperor. Trees were planted at military shrines and throughout Japan—their falling petals a reminder of the fallen soldiers.Today over 200 species of cherry blossom trees cloak the archipelago of Japan. Though they've carried different meanings throughout the ages, they continue to bring communities together year after year under a common one: to celebrate Japan's most beloved flower.Clouds of pink blot out the city's metallic skyscrapers over Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, Tokyo.Falling petals dance through the air, signaling the end of cherry blossom season.Fallen petals blanket the ground in Inokashira Park, which is considered one of Tokyo's most precious green spaces.A security guard patrols Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden.

"The National Cherry Blossom Festival is one of Washington, D.C.’s most well-known and well-loved events. First held in 1935, the festival attracts more than 700,000 people when the flowers are in bloom.Springtime in Washington, D.C. kicks off every year with the city's famous Cherry Blossom Festival, when the fluffy pink cherry trees around the National Mall and Tidal Basin burst into bloom. Hundreds of thousands flock there to take in the beautiful flowers, making it one of Washington's most well-loved events. It's hard to imagine, but more than a century ago, this same area in D.C. stood naked without a cherry tree in site. David Fairchild, a food explorer with the United States Department of Agriculture, spearheaded an effort to landscape this area with cherry trees from Japan but encountered strong resistance from those who feared foreign species. Fairchild persevered and succeeded in bringing the cherry blossoms to the States, importing not only lovely trees but also the delightful Japanese custom of enjoying their annual bloom.The cherry blossoms burst forth in pink every spring around the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C.Born in Lansing, Michigan, in 1869, David Fairchild moved to Manhattan, Kansas, at age 10 when his father, George, became president of Kansas State Agricultural College. Through his father, David met many scientists who told tales of expeditions in far-off lands, which inspired the boy. As a young man, David studied botany and eventually moved to Washington, D.C. There he found his dream job with the U.S. government as a food explorer, traveling the world in search of new crops to introduce to the United States.Driven by curiosity and fueled by optimism, he brought to the States many plants and fruits now taken for granted, such as mangoes from India, peaches from China, and avocados from Chile. They transformed the American kitchen, but one would transform the American capital. In 1902 Fairchild first encountered sakura, the flowering cherry trees of Japan. For centuries the Japanese have held picnics and parties every spring to view the blossoms in a custom called hanami. Enchanted by their beauty, Fairchild wanted to bring the trees back home.After marrying in 1905, David Fairchild and his bride, Marian, lived on a 10-acre property just outside of Chevy Chase, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. There Fairchild planted his favorite plants from his travels, but all Marian wanted were the Japanese cherry trees, which she referred to simply as “cherry blossoms.”Fairchild ordered 125 of them from the Yokohama Nursery Company in Yokohama. The nursery owner, a man named Uhei Suzuki, was so pleased to hear from Fairchild—and to have an American customer—that he nearly gave away the trees for free, just 10 cents apiece.In the spring of 1906 Fairchild’s imported trees bloomed for the first time, and word of the pink blossoms brought so many onlookers to their home that Fairchild ordered 300 more as a gift to the city of Chevy Chase.The Fairchilds’ front yard may have looked gorgeous, but Washington, D.C., wasn’t terribly pretty. A nation’s capital is symbolic of its stability and aspirations—a notion that Teddy Roosevelt supported when he urged Congress to transform the raw land around the Washington Monument into a park with fields, paths for walking and bicycling, and a separate road for automobiles to pass at greater speed. This area would come to be called the speedway, and many thought the flowering cherry trees could lend the Tidal Basin an elegant visage.In late March 1908 Fairchild gave a series of lectures in the D.C. area. He described his travels and recalled his first view of the sakura in Japan. He ended each lecture by displaying a photograph of the unsightly speedway near the Washington Monument. What an excellent place, he mused, to plant cherry blossom trees. Shortly after, in the Washington Star, Fairchild’s thought was given front‑page treatment. If the trees were planted soon around the Tidal Basin’s speedway, they could bloom the following spring; and not long after, the newspaper reported, “Washington would one day be famous for its flowering cherry trees.”In the mid 1900s, discrimination against Japanese immigrants to the United States was hurting diplomatic relations between Japan and the U.S.A. Japanese immigrants had moved to the Pacific Northwest and were finding work on farms and railroads and in mining operations and canneries; as they found success, they purchased land and started businesses. Spurred on by prejudice and fear, nativist groups organized campaigns that sensationalized Japanese-Americans as dangerous and incapable of becoming “true” citizens. Nativists lobbied for legislation to restrict immigration and to isolate Japanese populations. In 1906 San Francisco segregated Japanese and Chinese children into separate schools, a move that outraged Japan. In an attempt to save the friendship, the U.S.A. and Japan entered into what was known as the Gentlemen’s Agreement in 1907-08. Under its terms, Japan promised to limit the number of immigrants to the States, and the U.S. government would persuade San Francisco to desegregate its schools. It was this fraught relationship that William Howard Taft inherited when he became president in 1909. To try to mend it, he turned to the beauty of the cherry trees.In 1909 the idea of bringing cherry trees to D.C. was gaining traction, and America’s new first lady, Helen Taft, was an advocate. While Mrs. Taft marveled over their beauty, her husband, President William Howard Taft, saw a diplomatic tool to build up international relations with Japan, a nation he had visited in 1905 as secretary of war.Now motivated to smooth over relations, Taft quickly realized that the cherry trees could be the perfect way to quell past antagonisms. To Japan, it was an opportunity to show off a beautiful piece of itself in America’s capital. Japanese officials also enjoyed the tacit admission that despite America’s larger size, population, and economy, the countries were, in a way, equals. So when the then mayor of Tokyo, Yukio Ozaki, was tasked with finding the 300 finest cherry blossom trees in the city to be uprooted and shipped to America, it became his top priority.Fairchild brokered the initial deal, but the plan for 300 trees ballooned into 2,000. Tokyo’s mayor selected so many trees that the steamer sailing across the Pacific was overflowing. To make room, the tree roots were cut.In December 1909 the trees reached Seattle. Port workers packed them onto temperature‑-controlled railcars and cleared the track ahead for the 13‑day trip to Washington, D.C. Excitement began to build, but there was at least one person who was not excited about the cherry trees: Charles Marlatt. Head of the Division of Entomology at the USDA, Marlatt believed that introducing foreign species could be disastrous. He realized that diseases and insects could spread quickly over large distances and wipe out entire industries. In the first few years of the 20th century, Marlatt tried to convince others that bringing in new nursery stock also brought in pests, weeds, and diseases.Fairchild saw little reason to worry. Hundreds of sakura had already been safely planted in the United States, most on his personal orders. While Fairchild had helped generate support and excitement for the exchange, Marlatt visited government officials, including the State Department, to caution of the dangers. Secretary of State Philander Knox believed the diplomatic benefits outweighed any biological risks, but to be safe Knox took Marlatt’s warning to President Taft anyway.The prospect of catastrophe did give Taft some pause. He ordered the trees inspected at the garden storehouse near the Washington Monument. Fairchild was asked to complete the initial inspection, and Marlatt insisted on being present too. When the two pried open a crate, Fairchild’s first thought was that the trees looked stressed; their short roots had left them vulnerable to corrosion on the month-long voyage from Japan. Fairchild believed they could be salvaged. Perhaps the tops could be pruned to reduce stress and allow the trees to recover from the trauma of transport.The Japanese had sent mature trees for they would bear vibrant blossoms the fastest, but their roots concerned Marlatt. When he closely examined them, Marlatt noted “serious infestations.” The roots were plagued with root gall, two kinds of scale, a new species of borer, and six other dangerous insects. Marlatt could make out the Chinese Diaspis, a white scale insect known to kill trees by ruthlessly feeding on fruit. He spotted the wood‑boring lepidopterous larvae that survive by gnawing on trees’ woody insides. And there was the San Jose scale, which Marlatt noted, despite its name, originated somewhere in China.Fairchild agreed with Marlatt that the trees were faulty, but he was worried most about how to tell the president. And that America, which had already rejected so much about Japan, would also have to reject its trees, the symbol of friendship in a fraught diplomatic relationship.There was no delicate way to handle it. Marlatt’s report about the infestations gave Taft little choice, and on January 28, 1910, the president ordered the trees burned. Everyone familiar with Japan’s sharpened sense of cultural pride braced for Tokyo’s reaction, and the likelihood that America’s attempt to bridge relations with the Japanese had been sullied, perhaps forever. As Marlatt and his team propped the trees together like a teepee, someone invited reporters to watch the fire. A news item appeared on the front page of the next day’s New York Times. The Washington Post ran a two‑page article about foreign plant danger. See? Marlatt and his henchmen effectively told the public: Thank goodness we were on the case.Yukio Ozaki, the mayor of Tokyo, was visiting Washington to witness the reception of Japan’s prized symbol when word got out about the bonfire. Shortly after, Ozaki received Fairchild in his hotel. Fairchild had come to apologize, or in a less dignified way, to grovel. But Ozaki had a different reaction than anyone expected, illuminating just how little American leaders understood Japan. In reality, Fairchild’s apologies were dwarfed by Ozaki’s. While Washington cringed at burning a gift, Tokyo apparently viewed the problem as having given a faulty present. “We are more satisfied that you dealt with [the trees] as you did, for it would have pained us endlessly to have them remain a permanent source of trouble,” Ozaki explained.And if President Taft would still entertain the exchange, Ozaki said, Japan would like to send over another shipment of trees immediately. Better trees this time, packed by experts. Mayor Ozaki’s wife, in a letter to Helen Taft, apologized again for the mishap and then characterized the second shipment of trees as a “memorial of national friendship between the U.S. and Japan.”Gardeners and chemists from several of Japan’s islands were brought to Tokyo to select another batch of sakura. Three thousand twenty trees for Washington were selected, and to hold them, a bigger, faster boat to cross the Pacific. The trees were raised in virgin sod, and their roots wrapped in damp moss. The trees were fumigated twice with hydrocyanic acid gas to asphyxiate any insects and then placed in cold storage to slow the trees’ metabolism.Marlatt wasn’t pleased upon hearing of a second shipment. But he considered it a small victory that the first shipment, with its faults on display to the public, had proved that biological imports couldn’t be left to chance. Fairchild was encouraged by the arrival of the second shipment of more than 3,000 trees and the verdict, after they received a “minute and careful examination,” that the trees were clean, young, and healthy.On March 27, 1912, Mrs. Taft broke dirt during a private ceremony in West Potomac Park near the banks of the Potomac River. The wife of the Japanese ambassador was invited to plant the second tree. Fairchild took a shovel not long after and participated in the event. It took only two springs for the trees to become universally adored by the American public, at least enough for the U.S. government to reciprocate and send Japan a gift in return. Officials decided to offer Japan a shipment of flowering dogwoods, native to the United States, with bright white blooms.Meanwhile, the cherry blossoms in Washington have endured for over a hundred years, each tree replaced by clones and cuttings every quarter century to keep them spry. As the trees grew, so did a cottage industry around them: gardeners, a public relations team, and weather monitoring officials to forecast “peak bloom”—an occasion around which tourists would be encouraged to plan their visits. David Fairchild introduced the Japanese tradition to the U.S. capital, where it has taken root and blossomed for many springs to come.",
"Fresh hops are ready for harvest in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. David Fairchild, a botanist and world traveler, brought Bavarian hops back from Germany to the United States. Descendants of those top-notch hops are used in American beer today.We take it for granted that our supermarkets are stocked with exotic fruit and vegetables like quinoa, nectarines, and avocados. But behind many of these now-commonplace items is a story of global exploration, skullduggery, and danger. At the center of it all is an American botanist most of us have never heard of named David Fairchild.Speaking from National Geographic headquarters in Washington D.C., Daniel Stone, author of The Food Explorer, describes how the flowering Japanese cherry trees on the National Mall, as well as most of the beer we drink, owe their existence to Fairchild; how Fairchild was arrested in Corsica for trying to smuggle out lemons; and how a battle over importing seeds and plants was fought out in the pages of National Geographic a century ago.David Fairchild was a food adventurer during a formative era in American history. After the Civil War, the U.S. was a very bare country: a lot of land with not many people living on it. Farmers were all growing largely the same things: a lot of corn, apples, cotton, and uniform crops like that. But the U.S. was hungry for economic, military, and culinary growth. So at the end of the 19th century, Fairchild tried to harness America’s appetite for new food.He went to every continent except Antarctica, traveled to over 50 countries, all by boat, and picked up a variety of crops that now seem commonplace in our supermarkets: 38 varieties of mangoes, avocados from Central and South America, Egyptian cotton from Cairo, and varieties of kale from Northeastern Europe. He even brought in individually sized pineapples that he thought Americans would like to eat like a banana or apple. He bartered for nectarine seeds in Baghdad and picked up a variety of different types of citrus in China, where all citrus fruits originated.The avocado is an evolutionary marvel. Most seeds originated because there was a need for them to be spread. The fruit evolves to attract an animal to eat it and spread it. It’s hard to think of an animal now that would eat an entire avocado, swallow its pit whole and spread it somewhere. But about 11,000 years ago, animals once existed that did that, like glyptodons, giant armadillos the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, and gomphotheres, proto-elephants with four sets of tusks.Since then, avocados have existed in the cultures of Central and South America. Fairchild visited parts of Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia, and when he got to Chile on his trip around South America, he picked up strains of avocados that did not exist in North America and that ripened much faster than avocados found elsewhere in Central America. He sent an enormous shipment of about 1,000 avocados back to Washington. They arrived fairly rotten, but the seeds were salvageable. In about 1898, those seeds were sent to USDA experiment stations mainly in the American West. About 20 years later, farmers were growing them in great quantities, leading to avocado aficionados, who collected different varieties.In the early 1930s, a postal carrier in Southern California, who loved collecting and experimenting on avocados, grew a variety of seeds. One of them sprouted in a different way. It grew straighter and fruited faster than the other trees, and its fruit was more tender and less stringy than any he’d seen. It won several awards at agriculture fairs; and in the mid 1930s, a lawyer friend suggested he patent it. The postal carrier’s name was Rudolph Haas. And the Haas avocado is still the dominant variety we eat today.Lathrop was a fabulously wealthy, well-travelled man who had inherited a fortune from his father, a real estate developer in Chicago, which financed his trips around the world. He was constantly on the move, circling the world every two years by boat. On one of those boat rides, he met a young David Fairchild, a botanist in training with a hunger for exploration. Lathrop, an aimless, eccentric philanthropist looking for a purpose, realized that they could combine their expertise, with Lathrop providing the money and means and Fairchild providing the brains to know which fruits and vegetables to collect.Lathrop would amass circles of people around him wherever he went, telling stories that always fed his ego. He’d emerge in every story as the omniscient, well-rewarded hero, who was always proven right. He never had a permanent address. The only place he ever lived for any period of time was in San Francisco, in what was called the Bohemian Club, where men who enjoyed the arts and the company of other men would sit around, pull pranks on each other and tell stories.After several years of travelling on Lathrop’s dime, Fairchild brought the idea of food exploration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. At this time in American history, more than half of the labor force was farmers. There were millions of them and the government needed to find ways to make their jobs and lives easier. Fairchild proposed finding them better seeds and giving them better tips on growing methods.The Secretary of Agriculture accepted the proposal and Fairchild started leading this office, with a few other explorers around the world. He was the seed traffic cop, sitting in Washington, receiving exotic plants and seeds from all over the world, until Lathrop interrupted his bureaucratic work and took Fairchild back on the road. They went around South America, through Europe, to Venice and then Cairo, as well as the South Malay Islands, Japan, and Hawaii.Travel before airplanes was all by steamship. These were not luxury ships, and often required travel of a month or more. Fairchild got arrested several times and caught diseases, including typhoid. Lathrop caught yellow fever. Both almost died as a result. Fairchild bargained with dangerous island tribes in South Asia and the South Pacific who had either never seen a white person before or were so mistrustful that they would shoot arrows at Fairchild’s boats.Fairchild would go to a country, charm the local officials and sometimes take portraits of people who had never had their portraits taken, before asking them for seeds. He would learn all about the culture before finding out what its prized agricultural products were. This was generally done in a diplomatic way. But there were a couple of places where it was covert. One incident was in Corsica, where he was sent to acquire the island’s prized citron, a relative of the lemon. He got arrested, and was interrogated and forced to leave, never to return.This was also true in Bavaria, where he went to acquire a special type of hop. American brewers were not making very good beer, and wanted better hops, so the government sent Fairchild to Bavaria to acquire the best in the world. People didn’t trust him, because they didn’t want an American stealing their prized hops. But he charmed and flattered them, and eventually one of the growers allowed a small package of hop seed to find its way into Fairchild’s suitcase. It made its way back to the U.S., where it was propagated in the Pacific Northwest. Some of the greatest hops in the world are still grown there from descendants of those original seeds.Introducing plants came with some side effects, intended or unintended. Fairchild visited Japan in 1902 and saw flowering cherry trees that he later introduced to the U.S. Japan was delighted to send them, but in their excitement, they sent mature trees with long roots. When the trees were inspected on the National Mall, they were found to be carrying more than half a dozen insects and different types of fungus, so they were burned.Many Americans thought, “There goes our permanent relationship,” but surprisingly, the Japanese officials felt so embarrassed to have sent a gift containing harmful things that they apologized profusely and made sure that the best gardeners in Japan were available to make a selection of a second round of trees. Every spring the trees we see in Washington, and other cities around the U.S., owe their existence to that diplomatic arrangement between Fairchild and Japan.Fairchild and Marlatt grew up together in Kansas; Marlatt was the best man at Fairchild’s wedding. Fairchild was a botanist and Marlatt was an entomologist; he studied insects. This is where their friendship ended because Marlatt was worried that the plants Fairchild was bringing in contained invasive insects or fungi that could wreak havoc in American fields.The two of them had a nativist disagreement, which comes up in several different eras, including our own, about what we want to import or keep out. Marlatt warned that we shouldn’t take the risk, even if Fairchild’s plants were helpful. The two of them wrote cover stories in National Geographic in the same year arguing the value of new plants versus the potential damage of foreign pests.Fairchild was the son-in-law of Alexander Graham Bell, the second president of National Geographic. Being in the family, Fairchild thought he would have some measure of protection from the magazine. But as a scientific journal, the editors at the time offered space to anyone that could make their case and provide evidence to support it. So National Geographic printed both of their stories.Fairchild argued that there are endless riches to be found around the world in the form of beneficial plants, and that we should find and import as many as we can. Marlatt argued that, even if they were beneficial, they came with unintended consequences, so we should close our doors and not accept anything foreign that had not been tested.The modern supermarket is a lesson in geography and the lasting legacy of Fairchild. When you pass peaches and nectarines, those contain genes from the peaches and nectarines that he sent back from the Middle East. Dates we eat at Christmas can be traced back to Baghdad. Citrus varieties, including navel oranges, clementines, and ruby red grapefruit, all came from China thanks to Fairchild. Kale and quinoa, which only reached their popularity in the modern era, were brought in Fairchild’s trunks more than one hundred years ago.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk.

"Citrus, in many ways, stands alone. So many cultivated species have come from so few primary ancestors. Just three, in fact: citrons, pomelos, and mandarins, all native to South and East Asia before they started their journeys west, to places like Florida, California, and Brazil that built entire economies around fruits from the other side of the world.Such simple lineage is the result of impressive commonality. Almost all citrus has the rare genetic combination of being sexually compatible and highly prone to mutation. Such traits allow their genes to mix, for thousands of years on their own, and eventually, at the hands of humans. The product of so much natural crossing in the wild and selective breeding at research farms and in fields is every orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit you’ve ever eaten.No other fruit genus can boast such pedigree, and new research is bringing clarity to the origin of citrus. Grapefruits are a human discovery, less than 300 years old. But citrus itself is ancient. Fossilized leaves discovered in China’s Yunnan Province in 2009 and 2011 suggest citrus has existed since the late Miocene epoch, as many as seven million years ago. Humans, however, have brought a great winnowing: Out of thousands of wild types, only a few dozen have become commercial behemoths like the navel orange, Eureka lemon, and Mexican lime. They’re the citrus one percent.The scientists who study citrus love it for its appeal, its mystery, and its drama. “There’s something fascinating, freaky, even sexy about citrus,” says pomologist David Karp, whose research informs the above illustration. A bacterial disease called huanglongbing (a.k.a. citrus greening) that causes plants to defoliate, decay, and eventually die, is threatening commercial production on every arable continent, including North America, where the disease arrived in 2005.Yet a fruit group of such illustrious history won't be exterminated so easily. The future is likely to bring more types of citrus, not fewer. “Citrus is competitive,” says citrus breeder and geneticist Fred Gmitter, explaining how global researchers race to develop, say, mandarin oranges that are sweeter, seedless, and easier to peel. “In the near future you’ll see a lot of outside-the-box new stuff.” And, an ever expanding family tree.",
"This year marks the 500th anniversary of Germany's venerated beer purity law, Reinheitsgebot. By restricting the ingredients brewers could use, this fateful fiat essentially defined beer as the beverage we know it as today.Issued by the Duke of Bavaria in the town of Ingolstadt in the spring of 1516, the law prohibited beer makers from using anything but hops, barley, and water in their brews. (The role of beer’s fourth key ingredient, yeast, wasn’t fully understood until Louis Pasteur came along.)While half a millennium may seem like a long time, Dr. Patrick E. McGovern, an ancient alcohol expert at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, stresses that the Reinheitsgebot "defined what beer is at a relatively recent date."Recent is right when you're talking about the history of what might be the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world.For millennia—starting well before the Common Era—brewers used everything from pine resin to an herbal mixture known as gruit to flavor and preserve beer, which could be made from just about any fermentable grain. Evidence shows honey and fruits were often incorporated into early recipes to add sweetness—and to mask the taste of suds gone bad.According to Max Nelson, a historian at University of Windsor in Canada, it's the cloistered set (friars and nuns) that deserve credit for catching on to the magic of the hop flower first—in the ninth century A.D. It didn't take long for word of hops' superiority as a preserving agent to get around. “That drove out other mixtures,” he says, “[so] the Reinheitsgebot really codified something already in place.”Though it's often cited as the oldest food-quality regulation in the world, the law may have had other motivations—like protecting Bavarian brewers from international competition and preventing peasants from turning valuable wheat into liquid bread.As recently as the early 1990s, when the Reinheitsgebot was formally repealed, foreign beers that didn’t conform to the law were shut out. But even in an era of liberalized regulations, this is not a country that looks outside its borders for beer (imports account for less than 10 percent of the current market).Despite a loosening of brewing standards, Germany still clings to the Reinheitsgebot as a point of national pride. “The 1516 law’s legacy is German beer’s worldwide reputation for quality,” says German Brewers’ Federation spokesman Marc-Oliver Huhnholz.Huhnholz is also quick to point out that five centuries of restrictions haven't made German beer boring. There are more than 200 varieties of hops and as many strains of yeast, all of which the nation's 1,300-plus breweries—half of them microbreweries—combine in different ways to create thousands of distinctive brews.And there’s no denying the Reinheitsgebot has had a global impact thanks to German immigrants who brought their beer culture with them. From Brazil’s Brahma to Chinese Tsingtao, the flavor of beer around the world was defined by Wilhelm’s 16th-century decree.",
"“Even more wonderful than the dizzy heights of the buildings is the blaze of electricity radiating from them,” National Geographic said of the New York City skyline in 1917. “People now living remember the time when there was no gas and candles were universal."Alexander Graham Bell hated few things more than summertime in Washington, D.C. He usually escaped to his estate in Nova Scotia, but one year obligations forced him to stay in the humid capital. Sweltering in 100°F heat, he wondered why humans had figured out how to warm a house but not how to cool one—until now. Nearby, President Woodrow Wilson had installed an ice plant that lowered the temperature in the White House to 80 degrees. By the time Bell read about it in the newspaper, he had already outdone the president. The cold air pumping–contraption he’d devised had brought the temperature in his room that day down to a chilly 65 degrees “with a delicious feeling of freshness in the air.”When 69-year-old Bell told this tale in a speech to the 1917 graduating class of McKinley Manual Training School, the students went wild with applause. The clapping became “so insistent,” a local paper reported, that he was forced from his seat to deliver a surprising encore. “Could postage stamps be used in transportation of persons?” Bell asked. He’d thought of charging a flat rate for public transport, but the cost of building additional roads was too high. Perhaps, he ventured, according to the paper, “the flying machine will be the solution.”Bell’s speech—called “Prizes for the Inventor: Some of the Problems Awaiting Solution”—reflected on a century of progress and looked ahead with remarkable foresight. In it he marveled at the advances made in the past century: Gas lighting had evolved into electric bulbs, humans could “see our own hearts beat,” and automobiles replaced horse-drawn vehicles. He then went on to predict the commercial airplane, solar panels, and the need for renewable resources. Gilbert Grosvenor, Bell’s son-in-law and the editor of National Geographic magazine, asked for the text and published a revised version in the February issue. Now, one hundred years later, Bell’s predictions and warnings remain prescient.Bell had been raised in an era when schools “made scholars rather than scientists,” he told the students at McKinley when he took the stage. But the past century had birthed extraordinary discoveries, from the telegraph to the photograph. “I, myself, am not so very old yet, but I can remember the days when there were no telephones,” said the inventor of the telephone to thunderous applause. As America’s entry into World War I loomed, he promised that “the man of science will be appreciated in the future as he never has been in the past.”By his own measure Bell was at his intellectual peak. In the previous decade he’d worked on building the world’s fastest ship (it set the record in 1919), proposed renewable energy sources, and endlessly sketched flying machines (the device he described in an 1892 article resembled the helicopter invented 40 years later). The year after the Wright brothers received their patent, Bell’s kite lifted an associate to over 160 feet.In 1915 he’d made the first coast-to-coast phone call; soon after, a man in Virginia spoke to a man on the Eiffel Tower in the first transatlantic transmission. Bell predicted a day when calls—and “any mechanical operation”—could be made without wires. He also foresaw the devices someday displacing their makers: “On every hand we see the substitution of machinery and artificial motive power for animal and man power.”Two men support one of Bell’s tetrahedral kites. Holding the sign is five-year-old Melville Grosvenor, future editor of National Geographic.McKinley’s students were mesmerized. “He took the audience into his confidence and made them feel that he was unrolling to them the secrets of his scientific notebooks,” a newspaper reported.Bell made daily additions to the legendary notebooks: sketches of inventions, musings, press clippings. At home in Nova Scotia, more than 30 men worked to make Bell’s ideas reality. Some were small comforts: a system of ropes to open and close the windows so he didn’t have to get out of bed while reading. Others were huge undertakings: Bell spent decades trying to breed sheep with more than two nipples.While still working on the telephone, Bell grew interested in designing a flying machine. For three decades he experimented with aeronautics, including designs (above) for building “tetrahedral kites,” which used triangular cells for stability. In December 1907—the year after the Wright brothers patented their plane—one of Bell’s kites flew with a human in it for the first time. Its passenger, Lt. Thomas Selfridge, became the first person to die in a plane crash when he tested the 1908 Wright Military Flyer the following year.In 1912 Bell had written in a notebook: “You can say that man has conquered the mystery of nature.” But just five years later at McKinley, he voiced concern about the abuse of nature. “We can take coal out of a mine, but we can never put it back. We can draw oil from subterranean reservoirs, but we can never refill them again,” he told the students. Given the world’s great consumption, he foresaw a day when the supplies would run dry.While other scientists believed that dirty air would block the sun’s rays and cool down the planet, Bell was ahead of his time when he said he was “inclined to think we would have some sort of greenhouse effect.” As a solution, he proposed alcohol as an alternative fuel and sketched rooftop devices for collecting solar power from the sun.“The most remarkable thing about Doctor Bell is that he is younger, in mind, than most men of half his age,” a friend of his was quoted as saying in 1921. The next year, and a few months after receiving his last patent, Bell died at age 75. During his funeral all 14,346,701 phones in America went silent for one minute in tribute to their inventor.",
"Three Japanese girls in kimonos are framed by cherry blossoms. Eliza Scidmore later helped bring the trees to Washington, D.C.In 1883, Eliza Scidmore hopped on a mail steamer to Alaska. Tired of society life in Washington, D.C., she was inspired by the dramatic scenery described by naturalist John Muir in the San Francisco Bulletin. The uncharted northern tundra had been purchased from Russia in the 1860s, but few Americans had yet visited it. The intrepid 27-year-old writer and photographer decided to see it for herself.Every morning Scidmore would rise at 6 for coffee and rolls, then spend the day viewing auroras and writing letters. “It’s a watercolor country,” she later described it to an interviewer.The articles about Alaska that she published in American newspapers captivated the public and impressed the day’s great explorers. When she compiled them into a book of travelogues—perhaps the first ever written about Alaska—a reviewer called her “one of the best women correspondents in the country.”A Javanese mother nurses her child in Indonesia. Scidmore often captured images of women and children while traveling throughout Asia.In the decades after that Alaskan journey, Scidmore became a household name to readers of National Geographic magazine, producing 15 articles and some of the journal’s first color photography. She’s considered the first female­ writer and photographer to be published in National Geographic, and the first women elected to its board. Over nearly two decades of involvement with the National Geographic Society, she held positions as an associate editor, secretary, and foreign secretary.Though women were sparsely represented in the Society, Scidmore was admired by Gardiner Greene Hubbard, National Geographic’s first president, and Gilbert H. Grosvenor, the first editor. Both sought her advice while developing the magazine. By advocating for more color photography, she helped influence and transform the young academic journal.Eliza Scidmore was born in 1856 in Madison, Wisconsin. Soon after, her family moved to Washington, D.C., where her mother ran a boarding house and claimed to know every president from Lincoln to Taft.These connections became useful later in life for Scidmore, who dreamed of travel. In the 1870s, women were just starting to be hired by newspapers as correspondents; Scidmore was among the first. She published her first series of columns in the National Republican newspaper at age 19, then wrote about Washington society for various papers, including The New York Times.Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore poses for a rare portrait in front of a painted backdrop.Since she sometimes wrote under the name “E.R. Scidmore” or “E. Ruhamah Scidmore,” many readers assumed she was male. Letters addressed to her began “Dear Sir.” Book reviewers praised the works of “Mr. Scidmore.”Scidmore was so prolific that she earned $1,000—the equivalent of $26,000 today— during a single week in the 1880s. According to a newspaper item, she used the funds to fulfill her childhood wanderlust.Scidmore was infatuated with Japan, which had recently opened itself to western visitors. Her brother held a diplomatic post there, and through him she plugged in to the social scene.Scidmore began writing dispatches from Japan. She admired the high status of Japanese women in Harper’s Bazaar, wrote about teapots for The Cosmopolitan Magazine, and analyzed the differences between Japanese and Chinese chopsticks. In an article for American Farmer about Japanese silkworms, she reverentially described the caterpillars as “delicately-reared aristocrats.”She returned to Washington, D.C., with photographs of cherry blossom trees— “the most beautiful thing in the world” —and began petitioning President Grover Cleveland’s administration to plant them along the Tidal Basin.Traveling, Scidmore told an interviewer in 1890, “must have been ‘born in me,’ like the original sin.” She recalled that as a child she studied maps and geography. “My daydreams were always of other countries.”That year she joined the National Geographic Society—then a two-year-old organization seeking to gather the era’s luminaries of science and exploration. She was one of only a dozen female members. Two years later, an all-male board unanimously elected her the Society’s corresponding secretary.Scidmore brought in explorers and diplomats for the Society’s burgeoning lecture circuit. She also made speeches herself on subjects such as the Far East and Alaska, which she visited at least five times. Muir so admired her that he used her middle name to christen Mount Ruhamah—there’s also a Scidmore Glacier and a Scidmore Island—and maintained a correspondence with her for years.“I wasn’t sold on Mt. Everest,” she once wrote to Muir. “For after starting in the middle of the night twice to go up ... and see the sun rise over it, what did I see as the biggest, highest thing on earth? A little white nub of a thing off on the sky line, just a size larger than my thumb. I’ll back my Mt. Ruhamah against it any time when it’s snow on.”In the late 1890s, Hubbard asked Scidmore for her opinion of the young National Geographic magazine. She responded that she had been studying similar European publications, and based on their work, thought the Geographic could use “some shaking up.”“It is a splendid beginning and a marked advance upon what we had before,” she wrote, “but we need to have it make another leap and become a full-fledged, serious standard magazine of geographic literature.”A 10-year-old groom (right), and a girl who could be his bride, travel on a palanquin—a float carried by bearers—during a wedding procession in India.The shake-up arrived as pictures.The first photograph in the magazine’s text-crammed pages appeared in 1890. But it wasn’t until 1905—when Grosvenor packed 11 pages with the first photographs of Lhasa, Tibet—that pictures become the magazine’s centerpiece. A few months later, Grosvenor published 138 photos of the Philippines; the next year, he devoted a whole issue to wildlife and nature photography.Thanks to these moves, membership increased from 3,000 to 20,000 in just two years.In the 1890s, the organization that is now the Smithsonian Institution gave Scidmore a Kodak camera to document her travels across India, Japan, China, and the Indonesian island of Java. She is likely National Geographic’s first female photographer. (Photographs attributed to her appear alongside her stories, but early records don’t clarify which photos she took and which she commissioned.)In 1909 she wrote to Grosvenor: “[W]hy not buy a piece of color photography printing? It’s coming to stay and you might as well take a first flyer on some of the red and yellow temples among green trees with snow on the ground … ”A Japanese woman sings while playing a shamisen. Scidmore's hand-colored photos were some of the first ever published by National Geographic magazine.He wrote back: “[I] would not dare to attempt to reproduce them in colors unless you were here to direct the engraver. I have been for a long time anxious to have some colored work, but the proper subjects have not yet materialized.”Color photography didn’t regularly appear in the magazine for a few years. It was extremely expensive, for one thing, and the Society’s board worried that it would dilute the magazine’s substance. But Grosvenor was determined to expand his journal, and Scidmore—who had started producing the color photography from her far-flung bases in Asia—was an asset.“We miss you very much this winter,” Grosvenor wrote to Scidmore in 1910. “You were always so full of ideas and suggestions and you really ought to live here permanently. The purpose of this letter is to call your attention particularly to our innovation of colored pictures and to inquire whether you cannot help us to secure other series like these.”Scidmore quickly complied, sending Grosvenor a batch of photos of women and children with the note: “I have had them made uniform in size and strongly colored so that you can cover yourself all over with glory with another number in color and thereby catch a few thousand more subscribers. It is that that seems to strike the average subscriber hardest, after the [stingy] way the great metropolitan magazines dole out their colored samples.”A woman comforts a child fearful of cold bathwater. Scidmore's 1914 article "Young Japan" was the second series she wrote and photographed about women and children in Asia.The 11 images printed in a 1914 spread titled “Young Japan” were some of the magazine’s first color photographs. The issue also contained the first autochrome, or natural-color, photograph. Though National Geographic wouldn’t put pictures on its cover until 1959, these “16 Pages of 4-Color Work” were proudly advertised on the front of the magazine. (The Geographic later published the first underground, underwater, and aerial color photographs as well.)Scidmore received $450—$10,000 today—for the series. The fee, Grosvenor told her, was "very much more than we have ever paid for photographs before." He consistently paid higher-than-standard rates for her photos and words. “Photos splendid," read a cable he sent to Scidmore. "Secure colored Korean [and] Chinese. More Japanese people.”Grosvenor offered a few tips in a letter: “[W]hat we want particularly is life and action in the photographs. A smiling baby is better than one whose face is in repose. People doing things, moving or running, are usually, but not always, more interesting than persons resting quietly.”Scidmore lived on and off in Japan, serving as an ambassador of goodwill for the U.S. and receiving a royal honor for her service: the Order of the Sacred Crown. Yet she maintained her close ties to the Society and frequently corresponded with Grosvenor.“I hope I shall not miss the wrestling match for the N. Pole …” she wrote in 1909 about the race in the Arctic pitting explorer Robert Peary against Dr. Frederick Cook.A street dancer lifts her flowing skirt in Delhi, India.In 1916, when the Society’s treasurer mistakenly sent her a “last notice” for overdue fees, she wrote to Grosvenor, asking him to “kindly throw him down stairs at the finish."By that point, the Society had 500,000 members, and Grosvenor was finding it difficult to keep up. But, he wrote, “I assure you that the National Geographic Society would not feel entirely on a sound foundation if your name were not continued on its roll of honor.”Scidmore become involved in World War I, then moved to Geneva to write about the newly founded League of Nations. She outfitted her house with a lifetime of souvenirs—including the throne seat of China’s empress dowager—and it quickly became a gathering spot for diplomats.A young Tamil girl in India is adorned in jewelry and silk. "For weddings, jewels are often [rented] by both families," Scidmore wrote in her caption, "and children of the slums wear eight and ten necklaces, the bracelets and jewels of a temple idol for one day only."In 1928, at age 72, she developed appendicitis and was hospitalized with complications. It was “a very poor, slow business, and you can imagine how disarranging to all my plans,” she wrote in a postcard. She was not a willing patient, it seemed. A cousin who was by her side cabled back to America that she “refuses food” and “fights remedies.”Eliza Scidmore died early on the morning of November 3, 1928. Her ashes were buried in Japan, along with her brother and mother.Sadly, Scidmore’s correspondence files in the National Geographic archives are slim. After her death, a close friend requested that all her letters be destroyed. Her cousin complied, writing that “I had been told their correspondence was one in which they wrote the most secret of things.”Upon her death, a newspaper in her home state of Wisconsin wrote, “It is probable, and indeed has been conceded in Europe and this country, that no American woman had a more cosmopolitan assembly of friends or more varied interests of work than Miss Skidmore [sic] has enjoyed.”In Japan, a cherry tree blooms in a public garden. Scidmore was so taken by the pink-blossomed trees that she spent years trying to bring them to America.But Scidmore’s place in history has been largely forgotten. Diana Parsell, who is writing Scidmore’s biography, believes that in an era when women’s lives were written as footnotes in their husbands’ stories, the pioneering journalist slipped into obscurity in part because she never married.Unwitting springtime visitors to Washington keep Scidmore’s legacy alive. After her first trip to Japan, in 1885, she spent nearly three decades—and six administrations—lobbying to plant cherry blossom trees along the waterfront. She was there in 1912 when First Lady Helen Taft planted the first of 3,000 trees.Today, those trees draw 1.5 million tourists annually. “I always recall,” Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in Reader’s Digest, “that we are indebted for this magnificent spectacle to the energy and vision of one American, Miss Eliza Scidmore.”",
"By Jennifer Pocock, former assistant researcher at National Geographic Traveler magazine.The peak cherry tree bloom has already come and gone, carpeting the sidewalks of America’s capital city with a layer of pink and white petals. For the Japanese, this blossoming is a metaphor for life: a brief and brilliant burst, followed by a certain fall.Yet the life of Eliza Scidmore — the woman who brought the now-famous trees to Washington a hundred years ago today — seems a testament to the contrary. Scidmore (pronounced Sid-more) labored for 24 years to bring the government around to the idea of the planting. And on March 27, 1912, she finally helped root the saplings in a small unassuming ceremony at the north end of the Potomac Basin.Scidmore was both steadfast and intrepid. Born into a family of adventurers, she had been bitten by the travel bug early in life and did whatever she could to continue seeing new, far-flung places, despite the criticism she must have met for her independent spirit.She attended Oberlin College for a short time before leaving to write society columns for newspapers around the country. The money she earned from the job allowed her to explore other, more exotic travel possibilities. The first of these was a journey to what was then “the Department of Alaska” — and the start of a lingering love affair with the Last Frontier — in 1883.“Each summer I bought my long purple ticket, reading from Portland to Sitka and return, with pleasurable anticipations; and all of them – and more — being realized I yielded up the last coupons with regret,” she wrote.One of the steamships she took to Alaska, the Idaho, became the first to successfully navigate the northern end of Glacier Bay. James Carroll, the ship’s captain, named Scidmore Island after his esteemed passenger.These trips provided fodder for articles, which were published by many of the top newspapers and magazines of the day, and then collected and republished as a book in 1885. It was considered the first comprehensive travelogue of Alaska, recording, with near-anthropological scope and precision, not only her travels, but also descriptions of the towns and customs of its people.Her adventures continued. In 1885, she visited the Far East for the first time on a trip to Japan to visit her brother. She fell in love with the people, the culture, and most of all, the cherry blossoms. Soon after her return, she began to petition Washington to plant the delicate trees in the barren areas around the Capitol — a fight that would last almost a quarter of a century.Scidmore joined the National Geographic Society in 1890, two years after it was established, where she became not only the Society’s first female writer, photographer, and board member, but also an associate editor and overseas ambassador.She was behind other firsts, as well, having brought the word tsunami to the English lexicon through her coverage (for National Geographic) of the aftereffects of an earthquake off the coast of Hondo in the summer of 1896.Though she worked tirelessly in Washington, D.C. for the Society and for her cherry trees, Scidmore’s restless spirit always called her to far-off places. India, China, Java, and the Philippines, to name a few.In Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), she climbed Dambool Rock, something she described in a 1907 article for National Geographic magazine as “an enchanted mesa that burned blood red and purple in the sunset and seemed impossible of attainment by any two-footed climber.”But through all of her adventures, her heart belonged to Japan — and to her beloved blossoms. Her dogged quest to see a “Mukojima on the Potomac” paid off when First Lady Helen Taft finally got wind of her proposal and provided enough political clout to get the idea off the ground, or, rather, in it.Scidmore returned to Japan again and again, leaving the U.S. for good in 1923 when the government began clamping down on travel. Her firsthand accounts and hand-colored photographs of the landscape and people there brought a new understanding of Japanese culture to a curious America in the lead up to the first World War. When she died in 1928, her ashes were buried in Yokohama, under a springtime carpet of pink and white petals.For someone so out there in the world, Scidmore was a fiercely private individual. Having instructed her parents to burn her personal letters upon her death, we have little insight into who she was behind closed doors. But Scidmore leaves behind seven books of travel writing, 17 photo-driven articles in National Geographic magazine, and thousands of blooming cherry trees along the Potomac that continue — despite the odds — to provide a fitting legacy for her abiding spirit.This article was written with some consultation with Paul Martin, a former National Geographic Traveler editor. His new book, Secret Heroes: Everyday Americans Who Shaped Our World, is available for pre-order on Amazon.com.",
"Cherry blossoms ring the Tidal Basin and Jefferson Memorial during spring in Washington, DC.Since the introduction from their native Japan in the early 1900s, blossoming cherry trees have proven harbingers of seasonal change in the United States. Bred for blooms and not for fruit, varieties like Yoshino, Kwanzan, and Akebono explode in a showy spectacle of delicate pink and white flowers for around two weeks each year. The downy blooms blanket parks, gardens, and towns in a visual transition away from the harsh chill of winter and toward the growing warmth of longer days.The tradition of cherry blossom festivals in the U.S. dates to 1935, when the National Cherry Blossom festival began to honor Japan’s 1912 gift of some 3,000 trees. Not only do these celebrations in communities around the country persist as symbols of international peace and friendship, but they also mirror hanami, outdoor fêtes beneath sakura, cherry blossom blooms, which have been held in Japan since the late eighth century. There, the fleeting flowers have long served as spiritual metaphors, and a reminder to live in the present moment. (Embrace spring with pictures of Japan’s cherry blossoms.)An individual tree's blooms only last around one week, while whole stands bloom and fall in about two. Understanding bloom timing is useful when trying to match a visit or festival to their short-lived, natural beauty. Typically, peak blooms—when 70 percent of flowers in a stand are out in their full, showy glory—arrive in the nation’s capital sometime between the last week of March and the first week of April. In New England, cherry trees bloom some 20 days later, and in southern states—like Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas—a week-and-a-half to two-weeks earlier. More precise predictions must consider year-over-year comparisons of the complex interplay of weather and climate, including factors like cloudy days, rain and snowfall, and temperature.The National Park Service, tasked with predicting peak bloom in advance of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, says it’s virtually impossible to say with accuracy more than 10 days from the actual event and human-induced climate change can make precise estimates even more challenging. Bart Connors Szczarba, a locally-dubbed “Chief Bloomologist” based in New Haven, Connecticut, notes that, “Until you see green buds, there won’t be blossoms. They fall into a pattern but can bloom out of nowhere!” He adds that cold winters are good for blossoms. “What's bad is warmth followed by snow and freeze, like Washington had last year or the year before.”Though the National Park Service won’t give their official predictions for 2019 until March 6, you can make your own educated guess by looking at the bloom times in the capitol in years’ past, and by watching the park’s cherry blossom cam.Surrounded by blooming cherry blossom trees and the serene Lake Kawaguchiko, Dungo captured the majestic beauty of Mt. Fuji, one of Japan’s most scared mountains.Eleven species of flowering cherry tree ring the Tidal Basin fronting the Potomac River in National Capitol Park. Their scenic blooms draw some 1.5 million people during the four-week celebration, which salutes spring and international friendship. In 2019, 40 different events—most free and open to the public—include a kite festival, parade, fireworks, and art installations, while across the capital, schools and neighborhoods plant new trees, and everything from buildings to busses don pastel pink. (The colorful history of Washington’s cherry blossoms.)Georgia’s Macon-Bibb county holds the congressional record for the largest concentration of cherry trees in any U.S. county—and boasts nearly a hundred times more than the National Mall. The area celebrates its blossoms for the 38th year in 2019 with plant sales, a parade, concerts, outdoor movies, markets, and quirky competitions like a wiener dog race. The festival culminates with tethered hot air balloon rides and fireworks over downtown.The city’s 70-odd cherry blossom trees—most planted in 1978—surround a rectangular park in downtown and form a tree tunnel over one block of Hughes Place. A single-day springtime celebration doesn’t always coincide with the best blooms, but it does with the anniversary of city’s founding in 1638, and includes artist and author presentations, international food vendors, a puppet show, and live jazz.This Southern city celebrates spring and Japanese culture with its 11th annual festival. Around 1,000 cherry trees have been planted in inner-city parks and neighborhoods in the last 10 years, a testament to the power of nature to revitalize. “Nashville is beautiful during cherry blossom blooming time because of all the trees,” says festival organizer Ginger Byrn. “It can often be a wonderful surprise when you round the corner or turn down a street and see all of the beautiful pink blossoms.” Popular festival events include trapeze performances, martial arts demonstrations, anime vendors, and a cosplay contest. New this year: mochi pounding demonstrations and daytime tea ceremonies.See full-size and bonsai cherry trees spanning 42 cultivars throughout the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens. Different varieties bloom at different times from late March through early May. The single-weekend Sakura Matsuri celebrates Japanese heritage and cherry blossoms and draws tens of thousands of visitors each year— the highest attended event in an American public garden. This year rock and jazz concerts, performance art, and taiko drumming will be held in and around the newly-opened Water Garden, the recently reopened Plant Family Garden, and its Cherry Walk, which has been planted in cherry trees since 1921.Tiny Marshfield has a population of 7,300 that blooms with its cherry blossoms each April. Instead of a traditional spring or international cultural festival, this cherry blossom shindig is a showcase of Americana and Missouri heritage beneath the town’s beautiful blooms. Native son astronomer Edwin Hubble and other Missouri luminaries, including descendants of former U.S. presidents, are honored in luncheons and at the annual cherry blossom parade.The Dallas Arboretum hosts a six-week celebration of spring, featuring concerts, talks, floral arrangement classes, beer and wine pairings, and outdoor picnics. The backdrop is expansive gardens in full vernal splendor: 150 flowering cherry trees, alongside countless other flowers from daffodils to irises to 500,000 tulips. The only parade here is a progression of colorful blooms throughout the season; peak cherry blossoms are expected in mid-March.Ohio University’s 217 cherry trees line the bike path along the Hocking River beyond campus, living gifts from sister institution Chubu University in Japan. Each year, during peak bloom—usually late March to mid-April—the blossoms across from Wren baseball stadium are illuminated for late-night viewing. The Japanese Student Association hosts a Sakura Festival in conjunction with flowering that features presentations and internationally-themed events.",

"Golden wildflowers blanket California’s Carrizo Plain National Monument in spring, drawing photographers to capture their beauty. Online photography courses can help you sharpen your skills now for better images on 2021 trips.In early March, photographer Kathy Adams Clark was leading a tour group through Costa Rica, guiding students as they focused their cameras on volcanoes, rainbows, and turquoise-feathered birds. By the middle of the month, the frequent flyer arrived home in Houston, Texas, grounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and not sure when she would ever travel again. She taught her first online class the next day.This hard stop to her country-hopping lifestyle came as a shock. But it taught Clark a lesson: There are plenty of travel skills you can master from home.While helping students improve their technique by training their lenses on backyard dragonflies, Clark has been doing some studying herself. She’s read up on Medici family history and taught herself to make risotto in anticipation of her next journey to Italy. “I’ve got time to take a deep dive into a subject,” she says. Clark remains hopeful for 2021 adventures. “People are going to be so ready,” she says. “We’re not going to take travel for granted. We’re going to treat it as the treasure it is.”There are many classes, apps, and activities you can try now that’ll give you a leg—or hiking boot—up on your next trip.Travelers should always pack at least a couple foreign phrases, says Craig Childers, director of language courses for Washington, D.C.’s Goethe-Institut, a German cultural association with outposts around the world. “You can get by with English only [in Germany], especially in cities,” he says. “But if you know just a little German, you’ll be more confident and relaxed taking public transportation and ordering off menus.”In response to the COVID-19 travel slowdown, the institute has launched new online classes and virtual cultural programming, including a tour inspired by the Netflix noir series Babylon Berlin and video seminars on art and architecture.If you’re hoping to visit Tokyo next year then plan ahead with help from The Japanese Foundation Los Angeles, which offers free self-study courses and bilingual yoga classes on its Facebook page (you’ll learn that the word for inhale is “sutte”).Craving conversation? Tandem is a free app that lets its 10 million users teach each other their native tongues via texts, voice memos, or—increasingly—video calls. Sign ups have soared since February, says co-founder Arnd Aschentrup, who recommends that would-be travelers use the “search by city” option to get grammar tips with a side of local intel.Popular free app Duolingo, which saw a 101 percent boom in first-time users in March 2020, offers online tools for learning dozens of languages, including Finnish, which debuted in June.Discovering the traditions and perspectives of international places is the magic ingredient in many of Airbnb’s online experiences, which invite guests to learn to cook street tacos with a Mexico City chef or spend the day in Paris with a local.Israeli wine expert Guy Haran gave an online presentation about the country’s viticulture from his home near Tel Aviv on April 22, 2020. Many travel and cultural courses and presentations have gone virtual in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.British participants in Guy Haran’s virtual Israeli wine seminar learned about farming and grape-blending methods while tuned in on Zoom.On the “Follow a Plague Doctor through Prague” experience, participants “meet” their guide on the Czechia capital’s statue-lined Charles Bridge via a video that then winds along cobblestone streets to other landmarks. Because it was shot at night earlier this year, the video shows a far quieter and emptier Prague than most tourists have ever seen. The guide pops in—sometimes wearing a pointy-beaked doctor’s costume—to explain how diseased fleas shook the city some 300 years ago, interspersing the tour with historical photos and practical tips (theater recommendations, where to grab a microbrew, the best shopping streets).Amazon’s still-in-beta-testing Explore platform features similar online jaunts, with sessions welcoming you to tour Hong Kong’s working-class Sham Shui Po neighborhood or virtually shop for traditional arts and crafts in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The big difference is that Amazon experiences are one-on-one; as the platform is still in development, participants require an invite to book an experience.Israel was back in lockdown at press time, but it’s no problem to visit through the Jewish National Fund’s weeklong virtual tours. They transport a “busload” of up to 23 passengers to landmarks such as Jerusalem’s Wailing Wall and the Ramon Crater. Each day includes one hour of “sightseeing” via a combo of videos, photos, and maps followed by an hourlong Q&A, explains tour guide Jacob Shoshan, who’s led many interfaith groups dreaming of in-person trips. “It’s the Holy Land and it has sacred sites for so many people—Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and then Druze and Beha’i.” Most tours conclude with a “pre-Shabbat” experience to say goodbye—for now. A woman recently told Shoshan that this was her fifth virtual visit this year.If you’re seeking spirituality to combat 2020 stresses, consider a virtual yoga or meditation retreat staycation. Eat Pray Move, which usually runs yoga trips to Italy and Morocco, ships participants of its online, week-long sessions goodies including tea and incense to get them in the mood for asanas. Insight Meditation Society, known for its multi-day silent Buddhist retreats in central Massachusetts, now offers at-home programming, including a pre-election workshop focused on breathing and mindfulness. These techniques can prep you for future in-person retreats or just make you a more centered traveler.Whether your ancestors hail from Nigeria or Norway, investigating your genealogy can prime you for future heritage travel. Many groups that normally gather in person to discuss archives and research strategies have shifted online, making it easier for out-of-towners to participate, says Adrienne Whaley, president of the African American Genealogy Group of Philadelphia. She recommends mining relatives for information via virtual family reunions or interviews with elders. The more you learn, the better equipped you’ll be to see your great-great-grandma’s stomping grounds.(Related: How Ghana is helping Black American travelers explore their roots.)Brooklyn’s Greenwood Cemetery hosts “History Happy Hours” on Zoom, digging into topics such as floral symbolism on tombs. Historic Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., has been posting its virtual tours on YouTube, so you can tag along with docents whenever you want. To track down a particular relative, Congressional Cemetery archivist Dayle Dooley recommends Find A Grave, a free website with an easily searchable, international archive. Questions? Put out a request on the site. “We’re a helpful community of weird people,” Dooley says.The outdoors is in during the pandemic. Seek tips on camping, biking, paddling, and hiking at outdoor superstore REI’s recently restarted in-person workshops on topics such as outdoor survival skills, star gazing, and compass navigation. Now’s the time to set a high altitude or mileage hiking goal, recommends Sarah Maurer, a Colorado-based fitness coach. She preps clients for trekking and mountaineering vacations, such as up Pikes Peak or along Scotland’s 96-mile West Highland Way. “With months to work on it, you will improve in so many ways,” she says, noting that performing box step-ups during a Netflix binge is a great at-home conditioning move.(Related: Want to try camping for the first time? Read our advice.)Explore nature while you help preserve it by becoming a volunteer scientist. One organization that can get you started is Citizen Science Tahoe, which has users note what they see in Lake Tahoe: What color is the water? Is there algae? How about litter?Collecting data helps researchers better understand how to protect the lake, so people can continue to use it for kayaking and other water sports. “We want to compare what our eyes see to what we’re measuring,” says Heather Segale, education director for the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, which developed the app. “That requires multiple people doing multiple observations.”Wherever you are, keep an eye out for seasonal changes in plants and upload your notes to the Chicago Botanic Garden’s Budburst website. It helps people learn more about the species in their neighborhoods and contribute to a useful data set, says director Emma Oschrin. The program particularly blooms for kids thanks to downloadable activity guides encouraging STEM skills. For instance, one exercise shows how to use a tape measure to figure out the age of a tree. “Families can look at plants together while navigating this remote learning environment,” says Oschrin. Plus, it’ll fire them up for leaf-peeping trips and botanical garden visits.Right now, your travel Instagram might be stuffed with shots of city parks or local sculpture gardens. But a slew of online photography tutorials and classes can ready you for your next safari or national park odyssey, whether you prefer to shoot on your smartphone or with high-tech gear.Retired attorney Stuart Litoff, 68, of Washington, D.C., was supposed to travel to Spain and Sicily this year with photographers Tom and Cree Bol, who run small group tours that help budding shutterbugs shoot the wonders of the world. Instead, he’s taken several of their new online classes, covering topics like macro photography and speed lights. He misses the far-flung settings, but Litoff appreciates how the interactive, small-group Zoom lessons are boosting his creativity and technique. For homework, he’s misted strawberries with droplets of water to create dramatic close ups and darkened rooms to practice flash photography.(Related: Want to improve your travel snapshots? Use these tips from a Nat Geo photographer.)“So often we travel to these exotic places, and no matter where you point your camera, you have a great pic. Now, we’ve giving them tough challenges at home,” Tom Bol says.Litoff hopes to test out his new skills with the next in-person tour he has scheduled with the Bols—to Santiago, Chile, and Easter Island in January 2021. “Shooting those giant carvings at sunrise or sunset, being there to photograph that would be so special,” he says.",
"Dawn breaks over the Charles Bridge in Prague, Czech Republic.From the start of spring through the last days of autumn, Prague is abuzz with street fairs, exhibitions, concerts, and beer. Thousands of visitors—and locals, too—cram those cobblestoned streets to create what feels like, on most days, a nonstop carnival.The City of a Hundred Spires is at its best in spring and fall, but watch out for Easter, when crowds are at their peak. Summers are hot and muggy, and winters dark and cold, though the city does look gorgeous in fresh snow.The Prague Spring Music Festival, held over three weeks in May, is considered the height of the cultural calendar. It draws orchestras from around the world for dozens of mainly classical concerts, but also jazz, modern music, and vocalists. At the start of June, the Prague Fringe Festival is a weeklong celebration of English-friendly theater, comedy, dance, and, well, whatever. The Signal Light Festival, held over a fall weekend, features elaborate digital displays of light and music, projected onto the city’s historic buildings.Czechs prefer simple food done well. The national dish is roast pork, served with bread dumplings and sauerkraut. Look out, too, for Svíčkovánasmetaně: beef sirloin topped with a creamy sauce and served with dumplings, a dollop of cranberries, and a slice of lemon (to cut the cream). For drinks, the choice is easy: Czech beer is among the best in the world.Czechs are known for high-quality Bohemian crystal and cut glass, and many shops, including well-respected Moser, will ship it home for you. Easier-to-carry items include deep-red garnet jewelry as well as hand-crafted marionettes and wooden toys. Resist the urge to buy Russian nesting dolls, KGB hats, and other items that litter souvenir shops. These have little to do with the Czech Republic.Prague has perfected the art of public transportation, so there’s no need for cars or even taxis. Hop the tram or metro from place to place, or better yet, walk. The center is compact, and distances are manageable.Climb to the top of Letná hill, just north of the Old Town, for awe-inspiring views of the spires below and the bridges receding out into the distance. For a classic Charles Bridge plus Prague Castle mash-up, head to Smetanovo Embankment (Smetanovo nábřeží), just south of Charles Bridge, on the Old Town side of the river. Late mornings work best here, as the light comes in over your shoulder.",
"During the 17th-century European plague, physicians wore beaked masks, leather gloves, and long coats in an attempt to fend off the disease. Their iconic and ominous look, as depicted in this 1656 engraving of a Roman doctor, is recognizable to this day.The plague was once the most feared disease in the world, capable of wiping out hundreds of millions of people in seemingly unstoppable global pandemics and afflicting its victims with painfully swollen lymph nodes, blackened skin, and other gruesome symptoms.In 17th-century Europe, the physicians who tended to plague victims wore a costume that has since taken on sinister overtones: they covered themselves head to toe and wore a mask with a long bird-like beak. The reason behind the beaked plague masks was a misconception about the very nature of the dangerous disease.During that period's outbreaks of the bubonic plague—a pandemic that recurred in Europe for centuries—towns gripped by the disease hired plague doctors who practiced what passed for medicine on rich and poor residents alike. These physicians prescribed what were believed to be protective concoctions and plague antidotes, witnessed wills, and performed autopsies—and some did so while wearing beaked masks.Charles de Lorme, a plague doctor who treated 17th century royals, is often credited with the uniform.The costume is usually credited to Charles de Lorme, a physician who catered to the medical needs of many European royals during the 17th century, including King Louis XIII and Gaston d'Orléans, son of Marie de Médici. He described an outfit that included a coat covered in scented wax, breeches connected to boots, a tucked-in shirt, and a hat and gloves made of goat leather. Plague doctors also carried a rod that allowed them to poke (or fend off) victims.Their head gear was particularly unusual: Plague doctors wore spectacles, de Lorme continued, and a mask with a nose “half a foot long, shaped like a beak, filled with perfume with only two holes, one on each side near the nostrils, but that can suffice to breathe and carry along with the air one breathes the impression of the [herbs] enclosed further along in the beak.”Though plague doctors across Europe wore these outfits, the look was so iconic in Italy that the "plague doctor" became a staple of Italian commedia dell’arte and carnival celebrations—and is still a popular costume today. (Memories of the plague resonate in Venice during the coronavirus pandemic.)Venetians dress as plague doctors to celebrate the city's Carnival. This year, the last two days of the event were canceled due to concerns regarding coronavirus.But the forbidding ensemble was not just a deathly fashion statement: It was intended to protect the doctor from miasma. In the times before the germ theory of disease, physicians believed that the plague spread through poisoned air that could create an imbalance in a person’s humors, or bodily fluids. Sweet and pungent perfumes were thought to be able to fumigate plague-stricken areas and protect the smeller; nosegays, incense, and other perfumes were common in the era.Plague doctors filled their masks with theriac, a compound of more than 55 herbs and other components like viper flesh powder, cinnamon, myrrh, and honey. De Lorme thought the beak shape of the mask would give the air sufficient time to be suffused by the protective herbs before it hit plague doctors’ nostrils and lungs.In fact, plague is caused by Yersinia pestis, bacteria that can be transmitted from animals to humans and through flea bites, contact with contaminated fluid or tissue, and inhalation of infectious droplets from sneezing or coughing people with pneumonic plague.Three horrific plague pandemics swept across the globe before its cause was ultimately uncovered—the Plague of Justinian, which killed up to 10,000 people a day circa A.D. 561; the Black Death, which wiped out up to a third of Europeans between 1334 and 1372 and continued with intermittent outbreaks as late as 1879; and the Third Pandemic, which ravaged much of Asia between 1894 and 1959. (What is a pandemic—and why does it matter?)Ultimately, the plague doctors’ outfits—and methods—didn’t make much of a difference. “Unfortunately,” writes historian Frank M. Snowden, “the therapeutic strategies of early modern plague doctors did little to prolong life, relieve suffering, or effect a cure.”Plague doctors may have been immediately recognizable, but until the rise of the germ theory of disease and modern antibiotics, their costumes didn’t provide real protection against the disease.",
"Hell on Earth, the nightmare depicted by Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel in his mid-16th-century "The Triumph of Death" reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed the plague that devastated medieval Europe. Thought by most to be a scourge of the past, the bacteria of the plague still appears from time to time and has even been researched as a biological weapon by some countries.Plague is one of the deadliest diseases in human history, second only to smallpox. A bacterial infection found mainly in rodents and associated fleas, plague readily leaps to humans in close contact. Plague outbreaks are the most notorious epidemics in history, inciting fears of plague’s use as a biological weapon.Today, plague cases still pop up sporadically around the world—including in the United States or China, where a suspected case was recently reported in the Inner Mongolia region. But the disease is no longer as deadly as it can be treated with antibiotics when available.  Here’s what you need to know about the plague, including how it spreads, the difference between bubonic and pneumonic plague, the most infamous plague pandemics in history, and why it’s not all that unusual to see modern cases of the disease.For hundreds of years, what caused plague outbreaks remained mysterious, and shrouded in superstitions. But keen observations and advances in microscopes eventually helped unveil the true culprit. In 1894, Alexandre Yersin discovered the bacterium responsible for causing plague: Yersinia pestis.Y. pestis is an extraordinarily virulent, rod-shaped bacterium. Y. pestis disables the immune system of its host by injecting toxins into defense cells, such as macrophages, that are tasked with detecting bacterial infections. Once these cells are knocked out, the bacteria can multiply unhindered.Many small mammals act as hosts to the bacteria, including rats, mice, chipmunks, prairie dogs, rabbits, and squirrels. During an enzootic cycle, Y. pestis can circulate at low rates within populations of rodents, mostly undetected because it doesn’t produce an outbreak. When the bacteria pass to other species, during an epizootic cycle, humans face a greater risk for becoming infected with plague bacteria.Rats have long been thought to be the main vector of plague outbreaks, because of their intimate connection with humans in urban areas. Scientists have more recently discovered that a flea that lives on rats, Xenopsylla cheopis, primarily causes human cases of plague. When rodents die from the plague, fleas jump to a new host, biting them and transmitting Y. pestis. Transmission also occurs by handling tissue or blood from a plague-infected animal, or inhalation of infected droplets.Bubonic plague, the disease's most common form, refers to telltale buboes—painfully swollen lymph nodes—that appear around the groin, armpit, or neck. The skin sores become black, leading to its nickname during pandemics as “Black Death.” Initial symptoms of this early stage include vomiting, nausea, and fever.Pneumonic plague, the most infectious type, is an advanced stage of plague that moves into the lungs. During this stage, the disease is passed directly, person to person, through airborne particles coughed from an infected person’s lungs.If untreated, bubonic and pneumonic plague can progress to septicemic plague, infecting the bloodstream. If left untreated, pneumonic and septicemic plague kills almost 100 percent of those it infects.Three particularly well-known pandemics occurred before the cause of plague was discovered. The first well-documented crisis was the Plague of Justinian, which began in 542 A.D. Named after the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, the pandemic killed up to 10,000 people a day in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey), according to ancient historians. Modern estimates indicate half of Europe's population—almost 100 million deaths—was wiped out before the plague subsided in the 700s.Arguably the most infamous plague outbreak was the so-called Black Death, a multi-century pandemic that swept through Asia and Europe. It was believed to start in China in 1334, spreading along trade routes and reaching Europe via Sicilian ports in the late 1340s. The plague killed an estimated 25 million people, almost a third of the continent’s population. The Black Death lingered on for centuries, particularly in cities. Outbreaks included the Great Plague of London (1665-66), in which 70,000 residents died.The cause of plague wasn't discovered until the most recent global outbreak, which started in China in 1860 and didn't officially end until 1959. The pandemic caused roughly 10 million deaths. The plague was brought to North America in the early 1900s by ships, and thereafter spread to small mammals throughout the United States.The high rate of fatality during these pandemics meant that the dead were often buried in quickly dug mass graves. From teeth of these plague victims, scientists have pieced together a family tree of Y. pestis, discovering that the strain from the Justinian Plague was related to, but distinct from, other strains of the plague. (Read how modern plague strains descended from a strain that arose during the Black Death pandemic.)Plague still exists in various parts of the world, popping up sporadically and followed actively by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most cases have appeared in Africa since the 1990s.Between 2004 to 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported the majority of plague cases worldwide, with 4,630 human cases and 349 deaths. Scientists link the prevalence of plague in the Democratic Republic of Congo to the ecosystem—primarily mountain tropical climate. More recently, plague broke out in Madagascar in 2017, causing more than 2,300 cases.The United States, China, India, Vietnam, and Mongolia are among the other countries that have had confirmed human plague cases in recent years. Within the U.S., on average seven human cases of plague appear each year, emerging primarily in California and the Southwest.Today, most people survive plague with rapid diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. Good sanitation practices and pest control minimize contact with infected fleas and rodents to help prevent plague pandemics.Plague is classified as a Category A pathogen, because it readily passes between people and could result in high mortality rates if untreated. This classification has helped stoke fears that Y. pestis could be used as a biological weapon if distributed in aerosol form. As a small airborne particle it would cause pneumonic plague, the most lethal and contagious form.Of conservation concern, federally endangered black-footed ferrets contract another form of the plague, sylvatic plague, from nearby prairie dogs. Plague can decimate prairie dog populations, which are a critical food source for black-footed ferrets. Scientists have started to administer a vaccine to prevent plague outbreaks in prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets.",
"Scientists found remnants of dead plague bacteria in the teeth of skeletons from the Bedlam Burial Ground in London.The strain of bacteria that caused the Great Plague of London in 1665 has been identified for the first time. Scientists recovered DNA of Yersinia pestis—known to have been responsible for the Black Death in the 14th century—from skeletons discovered last year during the construction of the new Crossrail underground rail link beneath London.The Liverpool Street excavation cut through the remains of the old Bedlam Burial Ground, which was used between 1569 and the early 18th century. In all more than 3,300 skeletons were recovered, including a mass grave of 42 individuals who archaeologists suspected may have been plague victims.The discovery of Yersinia pestis DNA in the teeth in five of these individuals confirms they did indeed die of the bubonic plague and the discovery will likely shed new light on the Great Plague of 1665, perhaps even solving some mysteries about the swiftness and ferocity with which it spread. This was the last round of bubonic plague outbreaks in Britain, and wiped out 100,000 Londoners, nearly a quarter of the city’s population, in 18 months.“It does not behave that way today. It’s much slower and spreads less dramatically. Could it be that there was some form of mutation?” says Don Walker, senior osteologist at Museum of London Archaeology, who was involved in the sampling. “Or was it to do with host susceptibility and response? Were humans carrying greater disease loads in those days (e.g., tuberculosis) and had poor nutrition, making them more vulnerable?”The DNA was identified by teams of scientists from Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) and the Max Planck Institute in Germany. They studied the skeletons’ teeth, because enamel acts as a kind of time capsule in preserving the genetic information of any bacteria that was circulating in the individual’s bloodstream at the time of death. The bacteria itself perished shortly after its host did, 351 years ago, so the remains pose no risk today.MOLA senior archaeologist Don Walker examines a 1665 Great Plague victim.Scientists hope to be able to sequence the DNA from the 1665 outbreak and compare it with Yersinia pestis DNA recovered from a 14th century plague pit elsewhere in London.“We want to know if there was a local/European plague focus—a reservoir of the disease within a rodent population—or were there separate waves of plague coming from Asia,” says MOLA’s Don Walker. “Current evidence suggests the former.”They also hope to learn more about the five individual victims themselves. So far what is known is that they all were young—one aged between six and 11 years old, the other four young adults under 25. Of those whose sexes can be determined, two were male, one was female.Stable isotope analysis of strontium and oxygen in the individuals’ teeth will enable scientists to learn if they were native Londoners or if they moved to the city from elsewhere. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes can reveal how much meat, vegetables, and seafood they ate. And microbiome DNA from their teeth can further determine which airborne particles and pollutants they ingested in life.Scientists at Max Planck Institute in Germany identify 1665 Great Plague DNA excavated from London.The discovery comes as London marks the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London, whose cleansing flames have long been popularly credited with stamping out the plague, though the evidence is still open to questioning. “Current thinking is that the plague was starting to slow down by the time of the fire,” Walker says. “The majority of deaths by then were occurring in the suburbs outside the area of the fire, so the fire itself may not have had that much impact.”One thing is certain, however: After the fire, the plague disappeared and never returned, except as ghostly traces of DNA.Roff Smith has been a frequent contributor to National Geographic magazine for over 20 years.

"An illustration of a physician wearing specialized clothing to protect against the plague.Two of history's deadliest plagues, which swept across Europe hundreds of years apart, were caused by different strains of the same deadly microbe, scientists say.The finding raises the possibility that a new strain of plague could infect humanity again in the future.The Justinian plague struck in the sixth century and is estimated to have killed between 30 and 50 million people—about half the world's population at that time—as it spread across Asia, North Africa, Arabia, and Europe.The Black Death struck some 800 years later, killing 50 million Europeans between 1347 and 1351 alone.Both plagues were spread to humans by rodents whose fleas carried the bacteria.Rodents like this dormouse helped spread the plague."These strains of plague that are endemic in rodent populations all around the world [today] are just as deadly as the strains that caused the [earlier] pandemics," said Dave Wagner, an associate professor at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff and one of the authors of the new study, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases."So the potential for a [modern] pandemic are still there because the strains are there," he said.Unearthing a Common OriginWagner and his team confirmed a link between the two plagues after isolating tiny DNA fragments of the bacterium responsible for the Justinian plague, called Yersinia pestis, from the 1,500-year-old skeletons of two victims who were buried in Bavaria, Germany.Because the plague bacterium lives in the blood of its victims, the researchers focused on the skeletons' teeth. "There's a lot of blood vessels going into your teeth," said Wagner, who works in Northern Arizona University's Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics. "So they're a good place to find [Y. pestis DNA]."After extracting the ancient DNA and then repairing it, the scientists compared the DNA with that of other strains of the same bacterium, contained in a database."We took the Justinian strain and compared it to whole-genome sequences of 130 modern strains, and also the Black Death strain," for which others had done whole-genome sequences before, Wagner said.The scientists found that the strain responsible for the Justinian outbreak was related to, but distinct from, all other known strains of Y. pestis, including the ones responsible for the Black Death and a third pandemic in the 19th and 20th centuries, which scientists think originated in China and then spread globally, including to the United States.The strain behind the Justinian plague was an evolutionary "dead end" that didn't survive to the modern day.Threat of ReemergenceY. pestis is present in about 200 species of rodents around the globe, so it's possible the plague could reemerge in the modern world, the scientists say."It does and will continue to spill over into humans every so often," said study leader Hendrik Poinar, a molecular evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.However, if it does strike again, it will likely not be as devastating as in the past centuries for two reasons, scientists say."First, we've greatly improved hygiene since the times of the great pandemics," Wagner said, "which has controlled rat populations in these large urban centers where you expect these pandemics to start."The other thing is we now have antibiotics," he said, "and plague is susceptible to every antibiotic."Follow Ker Than on Twitter.",
"This is an updated version of an old piece, edited to include new information. Science progresses by adding new data to an ever-growing picture. Why should science writing be different?The road of East Smithfield runs through east London and carries a deep legacy of death. Two cemeteries, established in the area in the 14th century, contain round 2,500 of bodies, piled five deep. These remains belong to people killed by the Black Death, an epidemic that killed between 30 and 50 percent of Europe in just five years. It was one of the biggest disasters in human history and seven centuries on, its victims are still telling its story.In the latest chapters, Verena Schuenemann from the University of Tubingen and Kirsten Bos from McMaster University have used samples from East Smithfield to reconstruct the full genome of the bacterium behind the Black Death. This species – Yersinia pestis – still causes plague today, and the modern strains are surprisingly similar to the ancient one.Compared to the strain that acts as a reference for modern plague, the ancient genome differs by only 97 DNA ‘letters’ out of around 4.6 million. Y.pestis may not be the same bacterium that butchered medieval Europe 660 years ago, but it’s not far off. Indeed, Schuenemann and Bos found that all of the strains that infect humans today descended from one that circulated during the Black Death. Even now, people are still succumbing to a dynasty of disease that began in the Dark Ages.The Black Death is supposedly the second of a trilogy of plague pandemics. It came after the Plague of Justinian in the sixth to eighth centuries, and preceded modern plague, which infects some 2,000 people a year. But some scientists and historians saw features in the Black Death that separates it from other plague pandemics – it spread too quickly, killed too often, recurred too slowly, appeared in different seasons, caused symptoms in different parts of the body, and so on.These differences have fuelled  many alternative theories for the Black Death, which push Y.pestis out of the picture. Was it caused by an Ebola-like virus? An outbreak of anthrax? Some as-yet-unidentified infection that has since gone extinct? In 2000, Didier Raoult tried to solve the debate by sequencing DNA from the teeth of three Black Death victims, exhumed from a French grave. He found Y.pestis DNA. “We believe that we can end the controversy,” he wrote. “Medieval Black Death was plague.”Raoult was half-wrong. The controversy did not end. Some people argued that it’s not clear if the remains came from Black Death victims at all. Meanwhile, Alan Cooper analysed teeth from 66 skeletons taken from so-called “plague pits”, including the one in East Smithfield. He found no trace of Y.pestisHe found no trace of Y.pestis. Other teams did their own analyses, and things went back and forth with a panto-like tempo. Oh yes, Y.pestis was thereOh yes, Y.pestis was thereOh yes, Y.pestis was there. Oh no it wasn’t. Oh yes it wasOh yes it was.In 2010, Stephanie Haensch served up some of the strongest evidence that Y.pestis caused the Black Death, using DNA extracted from a variety of European burial sites. Schuenemann and Bos bolstered her conclusion by taking DNA from bodies that had been previously exhumed from East Smithfield, and stored in the Museum of London. “We sifted through every single intact skeleton and every intact tooth in the collection,” says Bos. They extracted DNA from 99 bones and teeth and found Y.pestis in 20 of them.Schuenemann and Bos took great care to ensure that their sequences hadn’t been contaminated by modern bacteria. Aside from the usual precautions, they did all of her work at a facility that had never touched a Y.pestis sample, they had the results independently confirmed in a different lab, and they found traces of DNA damage that are characteristic of ancient sequences. They also failed to find any Y.pestis DNA in samples treated in exactly the same way, taken from a medieval cemetery that preceded the Black Death. Finally, it’s clear that the people exhumed from East Smithfield did indeed die from the Black Death – it’s one of the few places around the world that has been “definitively and uniquely” linked to that pandemic.Even though they had its DNA, deciphering the ancient bacterium’s genome was difficult. The DNA was so heavily fractured that Schuenemann and Bos only managed to extract enough from four of their teeth. They lined up the fragments against a modern plague genome, and looked for overlaps between the remaining stragglers. In the draft that they’ve published, every stretch of DNA has been checked an average of 28 times.By comparing this ancient genome with 17 modern ones, and those of other related bacteria, Scheuenemann and Bos created a family tree of plague that reveals the history of the disease. They showed that the last common ancestor of all modern plagues, lived between 1282 and 1343 before it swept through Europe, diversifying as it went. The East Smithfield strain was very close to that ancestral strain, differing by only two DNA letters.This raises some questions about the plague of Justinian. The team think that it was either the work of an entirely different microbe, or it was caused by a strain of Y.pestis that is no longer around and likely left no descendants behind. It was the supposed second pandemic – the Black Death – that truly introduced Y.pestis to the world. This global tour seeded the strains that exist today.By the time it hit East Smithfield, the plague was already changing. Schuenemann and Bos found that one of their four teeth harboured a slightly different version of Y.pestis, which was three DNA letters closer to modern strains than the other ancient ones. Even in the middle of the pandemic, the bacterium was mutating.In the intervening centuries, Y.pestis has changed but not by much. None of the few differences between the ancient and modern genomes appear in genes that affect how good the bacterium is at causing diseases. None of them can obviously explain why the Black Death was so much more virulent than modern plague. “There’s no particular smoking gun,” says Hendrik Poinar, who was one of the study’s leaders.That’s somewhat anticlimactic. In August, Poinar told me: “We need to know what changes in the ancient [bacterium] might have accounted for its tremendous virulence… There is really no way to know anything about the biology of the pathogen, until the entire genome is sequenced.” Now that the full genome is out, it seems to offer precious few clues.Instead, the team thinks that a constellation of other factors might have made the Black Death such a potent pandemic. At the time, medieval Europe went through a drastic change in climate, becoming colder and wetter. Black rat numbers shot up, crops suffered and people went hungry. “It’s hard to believe that these people living in 1348 London weren’t being infected by various viruses,” says Poinar. “So you probably had an immune compromised population living in very stressful conditions, and they were hit by Y.pestis, maybe for the first time.” They were both physically and culturally unprepared. Their immune systems were naive, they didn’t know what the disease was, and they didn’t know how to treat or prevent it.In later centuries, it was a different story. Medical treatments helped to cope with the symptoms and affected people were quickly quarantined. Today, we have antibiotics that help to treat plague, and these would be effective against the Black Death strain. We have evolved too. People who were most susceptible to plague were killed, which probably left the most resistant survivors behind. Next, Poinar wants to look at the DNA of people buried in pre-plague and post-plague cemeteries to see if the Black Death had altered our own genome.Sequencing the Black Death genome may not tell us about why it was so deadly, but it still reveals how the bacterium evolved. Now, Schuenemann and Bos can look at how Y.pestis transformed from a bacterium that infects rodents to one that kills humans and how it evolved over time. That knowledge could be very important, especially since plague is rebounding as a “re-emerging” disease.The Black Death strain is the second historical pathogen whose genome has been sequenced and certainly the oldest (the first was the 1918 pandemic flu). There are many others to look at, including the Justinian plague strain, and historical versions of tuberculosis, syphilis and cholera.In the meantime, the East Smithfield bodies have told their story and Bos and Schuenemann are letting them rest. They were very careful with the teeth that they yanked DNA from, and they are now returning these samples to the Museum of London. Having yielded their secrets, they’ll be stuck back into their old skeletons.Reference: Bos, Schuenemann, Golding, Burbano, Waglechner, Coombes, McPhee, DeWitte, Meyer, Schmedes, Wood, Earn, Herring, Bauer, Poinar & Kruase. 2011.

PNAS http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1105107108PS Oddly, the team’s new paper, where they publish the full Black Death genome, somewhat refutes their first one, where they had only sequenced fragments. Previously, they identified two mutations in the ancient DNA that weren’t seen in any other strain. But those two mutations aren’t there in the full genome, and it now seems that they were a mistake. Ancient DNA can be chemically damaged so that Cs change into Ts. That’s probably what happened in the previous study. Schuenemann and Bos are more confident that their new sequences are correct. They treated their samples with a method that repairs the C-to-T changes, and they went over every bit of DNA 30 times.Image: Skeletons from the Museum of London;",
"Workers in Venice disinfected sites (the Rialto Bridge pictured here), a day after Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte announced a nationwide lockdown on March 10, an unprecedented move to help contain the spread of COVID-19.Until recently, the only modern-day contagion in Venice has been the plague of tourists, at least 23 million a year, that strains resources and infuriates residents of an improbable city—a mirage that lifts from a lagoon in the Adriatic.But with the firestorm of COVID-19, an actual plague has emptied out the Piazza San Marco, St. Mark’s Basilica, the Doge’s Palace and other attractions in a city of gilded domes and lapping waves. In the wake of mounting affliction throughout all of Italy, La Serenissima—“the most serene one,” as Venice is called—is anything but. The latest number of confirmed cases in the country, more than 12,400 at press time, leaves Italy with the highest number of infections outside of China where the virus first broke out in December.On March 8, at 3:30 a.m., Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a quarantine on the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces including Venice, Parma, and Padua. As the infection statistics kept climbing, it was announced a day later that the red zones would be extended to include the entire country and its 60 million people. Schools, gyms, museums and other public venues are closed. Sporting events, which until recently, were allowed to be played in empty stadiums with no spectators, have been suspended and nearly all commercial activity has been halted.Coronavirus coverage: Do travel bans really work?Venice’s Piazza San Marco (St. Mark’s Square), usually teeming with tourists, was eerily quiet after emergency quarantine measures began restricting movement in and out of the city March 9.Business owners in Venice started to close after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a “national emergency” March 9 due to the coronavirus outbreak.No one can leave the city, writes my Venice-based friend Antonietta (Tonci) Poduie, except for a health or work issue. Poduie is one of 54,000 residents who live in the historical center—the number drops each year as locals are squeezed out by rising costs and a diminishing stock of affordable housing. And now in addition to the routine flooding caused by the complicity of rising tides and sinking foundations, comes a viral pandemic with the malevolently regal name of corona (named for the pathogen’s crown-like form)—a wild card less predictable, infinitely more frightening, than the acqua alta.Hugging and kissing are banned, Poduie writes. “Can you imagine asking Italians not to kiss and hug?” Like every other theater, La Fenice, the city’s gilded bonbonnière of an opera house, is closed, though last week a string quartet played on stage before an empty house and was live-streamed on YouTube. (An appreciative virtual audience responded, the New York Times reported, with “an ovation of handclap emojis.”) It was the proverbial collaboration of insult and injury. The Fenice had just recovered from damage caused by record-setting high tides several months before.Last month, Carnival was stopped with just two days to go (“somebody said it was like canceling Christmas the day after”), Poduie reports. “We hear it is an influenza but a very contagious and aggressive one and we need to stay, as much as possible, indoors and—I would add, pray—but not at Mass (they were canceled).” Religious forbearance was not limited to Venice.In Rome, the Pope live-streamed his Sunday audience and Wednesday afternoon prayer. Parishes have emptied holy water fonts, and, priests, until Mass was canceled, placed communion wafers in the hand rather than on the tongue.Masked revelers were able to participate in the “Plague of Doctors Procession” during Carnival, before the annual festival was canceled Feb. 25.More aggressively than most countries, Italy is acting to contain the pandemic despite the crushing certainty of financial disaster on top of an already sluggish Italian economy. Italy being Italy, some tried to game the system. When whispers of an imminent lockdown in all of Lombardy first made rounds (the draft was leaked), there was a stampede to the train station in Milan to evade containment. “We must not try and be clever,” the prime minister implored. Now, with the whole country under lockdown there are fewer avenues for escape and cleverness is moot.The approach to containment has historical resonance. Venice and other city-states including Milan were the first to use quarantine during the Bubonic plagues in the Renaissance. Several “quarantine” islands sit in the Venetian lagoon as testimony to the past.“Venice was at the crossroads of trade, with mixes of people, so to ensure commerce and well-being, it turned to a pragmatic approach,” points out Anna Marie Roos, a professor of the history of science and medicine at the University of Lincoln in the U.K. “City-states were small enough to allow for enough state control to initiate quarantine.” Buildings on the quarantine islands mostly housed the poor. The wealthy retreated to their country houses.Plague doctors—who wore beaked masks containing aromatic substances, waxed coats, and gloves—were common during the bubonic plagues that struck Italy in the Renaissance period.As depicted in this 16th-century painting, “Pilgrimage of the Compagnia del Crocifisso to Loreto,” of the plague of 1523, Italy is no stranger to viral outbreaks and quarantines. Several quarantine islands sit in the Venetian lagoon today as testimony to the past.The long shadow of plague spans centuries. There were, Roos says, about 22 outbreaks of bubonic plague in Venice between 1361 and 1528, another in 1576 that killed a third of the population, and another in 1680 that felled 80,000 people in 17 months. The memory of plague is summoned by a common masked figure at Carnival: Dr. Peste, the embodiment of the plague doctor, who wears a long black cape and a mask with a long beak stuffed with herbs as prevention against the miasma of sickness.Read why plague doctors wore strange beaked masks.The infectious culprit then was a bacterium, Yersina pestis, which lives in the guts of a flea. Measles, smallpox, flu, or typhoid could produce a spike in mortality, Roos adds, and were also called plague. In Thomas Mann’s novella, Death in Venice, where the whiff of disinfectant first signals that all is not well, the offender is cholera.Tourism in Venice has evaporated. According to Claudio Scarpa, director of the Venetian Hoteliers Association, 80 percent of the city’s hotels (there are 400 in the association, which includes the surrounding area and municipality of Mestre) planned to close temporarily and 90 percent of the 8,000 employees in the sector were expected to stay home. To date, tourism hotel losses have reached a billion euros, which includes damage from the tidal flooding in November. Larger enterprises with more financial support will have more resilience.Gondoliers, like other workers in Venice, saw a drop in business after the government shut down schools and universities March 5 in the wake of rising deaths from COVID-19. The country closed its borders March 10.Smaller businesses will suffer most. On Tuesday, the day after the countrywide shut down, Giacomo Donato, an owner of La Feluca, a small family restaurant on the Calle della Mandola, had served lunch to a few nearby office workers. But with the sharply curtailed hours, it seemed hardly worthwhile; Italians eat dinner much later than the 6 p.m. restaurant closing time previously mandated.Yesterday, March 11, the decision was made for him when Prime Minister Conte ordered all shops and restaurants shut with the exception of pharmacies and supermarkets after cases increased by 30 percent in a 24-hour period.The virus has illuminated a sobering reality, even for those who find tourism so disruptive. “When I crossed the Rialto Bridge the day after the suspension of Carnival and saw the Campo Bartolomeo completely deserted, my stomach sank,” Poduie’s friend Silvia Zanon, who lives on the Lido, said. “Though the internet was full of Venetians smug with the satisfaction of reclaiming their city, I could not join the chorus. Venice is not meant to be deserted. Beauty is useless unless it is shared.”Find out if warming spring temperatures will slow the outbreak.“Beauty,” Venice’s former Mayor Massimo Cacciari once told me “is difficult,” and Venice, so lethally seductive, is beautiful and difficult beyond words precisely because of “overtourism,” as it is called. (The ratio of visitors to residents is about 370 tourists for every one resident.) Like it or not, tourism drives the economy. It generates billions, but exact figures mislead because so much business is done off the books. Perhaps, Silvia and Giacomo Donato suggest, when the pandemic abates, there will be room to rethink how Venice might accommodate tourism in a more sustainable way, but for now there are more pressing matters.“Be ready,” Poduie advises, her tone unmistakably grim, adding in closing: “Baci and abbracci…the only kind allowed…through the internet.”",
"For every resident Venetian, hundreds of visitors pour into the city each year to savor its gilded charms. Most will take in this view across San Marco Basin. Many could find themselves in acqua alta—high water.Nowhere in Italy, where calamity comes embellished with rococo gestures and embroidered in exclamation points, is there a crisis more beautifully framed than Venice. Neither land nor water, but shimmering somewhere in between, the city lifts like a mirage from a lagoon at the head of the Adriatic. For centuries it has threatened to vanish beneath the waves of the acqua alta, relentlessly regular flooding caused by the complicity of rising tides and sinking foundations, but that is the least of its problems.Just ask Mayor Massimo Cacciari, broody, mercurial professor of philosophy, fluent in German, Latin, Ancient Greek; translator of Sophocles' Antigone; a man who raises the level of political intellect to just short of the stratosphere. Ask about the acqua alta and Venice sinking, and he says, "So go get boots." Let them wear boots.Boots are fine for water, but useless against the flood that causes more hand-wringing than any lagoon spillover: the flood of tourism. Number of Venetian residents in 2007: 60,000. Number of visitors in 2007: 21 million.In May 2008, for example, on a holiday week­end, 80,000 tourists descended on the city like locusts on the fields of Egypt. Public lots in Mestre, a mainland part of the municipality where people park and take the bus or train to the historic center, filled and were closed. Those who managed to get to Venice surged through the streets like schools of bluefish, snapping up pizza and gelato, leaving paper and plastic bottles in their wake.La Serenissima ("the most serene one"), as Venice is known, is anything but. The world steps into the exquisitely carved font of the city, guidebook in hand, fantasies packed along with toothbrush and sturdy shoes. Splash! Out spill the Venetians. Tourism isn't the only reason for the accelerating exodus, but one question hovers like a haze: Who will be the last Venetian left?"Venice is such a lovely city," said the director of a cultural foundation. From his window you could look across the San Marco Basin—with its unending flotilla of speedboats, gondolas, and water-buses called vaporetti—and beyond to the Piazza San Marco, epicenter of Venetian tourism. "Really, it is a huge theater. If you have the money, you can rent an apartment in a 17th-century palazzo with servants and pretend you are an aristocrat."Please take your seats. In this play, Venice assumes a dual role. There is Venice the city where people live and Venice the city tourists visit. Lighting, sets, and costumes are so beautiful the heart aches, but the plot is full of confusion, the ending uncertain. One thing is certain: Everyone is madly in love with the title character."Beauty is difficult," Mayor Cacciari said, sounding as if he were addressing a graduate seminar in aesthetics rather than answering a question about municipal policy. He quoted Ezra Pound (the American poet, buried in Venice) quoting Aubrey Beardsley's line to William Butler Yeats, a kind of literary game of telephone—but then indirection is as Venetian as the curves of the Grand Canal.Cacciari, whose reputation for arrogance rivals his reputation for eloquence, seemed to be in a mood as black as his hair and luxuriant beard. (Not a streak of gray on his 63-year-old head. "Does he dye his hair?" I asked a press officer. "No. He is very proud of that," she answered.) The day before, a torrential downpour had flooded Mestre. Rain caused the flood, not acqua alta, Cacciari said, sitting in his office. "MOSE [the flood barriers under construction; see our interactive] wouldn't have helped. High tide is not a problem for me. It's a problem for you foreigners." End of discussion on flooding.No, he pressed, the problems lie elsewhere. The cost of maintaining Venice: "There is not enough money from the state to cover it all—the cleaning of canals, restoration of buildings, raising of foundations. Very expensive.'' The cost of living: "It's three times as costly to live here as in Mogliano, 20 kilometers away. It's affordable only for the rich or elderly who already own houses because they have been passed down. The young? They can't afford it."Finally, there is tourism. Of that, Cacciari the philosopher said this: "Venice is not a sentimental place of honeymoon. It's a strong, contradictory, overpowering place. It is not a city for tourists. It cannot be reduced to a postcard."Would you close it to tourists? I asked."Yes. I would close Venice—or perhaps, on reflection, a little entrance examination and a little fee." He looked bemused.Add the little fee to ridiculously high prices. Tourists pay $10 to ride the vaporetto, $13 for a soft drink at Caffè Florian, $40 for a plastic Carnival mask, probably made in China.Or you can buy a palazzo. "Grand Canal is prime," said Eugenio Scola as we sat in his walnut-paneled real estate office overlooking San Marco. He wore a beautifully tailored black jacket, a crisp white cotton shirt, jeans with an alligator belt, and black loafers with the luster of polished calf. For years, buyers were Americans, British, and other Europeans, Scola explained. "But now we are seeing Russians. Also Chinese."Among his offerings was a three-bedroom restored apartment on the piano nobile, or main floor, of a small 18th-century palazzo, or palace. "Molto bello," Scola said, pulling out the plans. There was a studio, library, music salon, two living rooms, a small room for the help, and a fine view from three sides. Only nine million euros. If I preferred, there was an entire palazzo—the 60,300-square-foot Palazzo Nani, to be offered with a permit allowing its conversion to another use. "It will probably become a hotel," Scola said. When I asked for something more affordable, I was taken the next day to see a 388-square-foot studio that would give a sardine claustrophobia, but it was only 260,000 euros. Someone would buy it as an investment or pied-à-terre. But probably not a Venetian.If you are a Venetian, and not part of what Henry James called the "battered peep-show" of tourist Venice, if you are a resident who lives in a fifth-floor walk-up apartment (elevators are rare in Venice), someone who gets up, goes to work, goes home, Venice is a different place altogether. The abnormal is normal. A flood is routine. The siren sounds, protective steel doors come down. Boots, essential to any Venetian wardrobe, are pulled on. The two and a half miles of passerelle—an elevated boardwalk supported on metal legs—are set up. Life goes on.Here, where everything anyone needs to live and die must be floated in, wrestled over bridges, and muscled up stairs, time is measured by the breath of tides, and space bracketed by water. The mathematics of distance, an accounting of footsteps and boat timetables, is instinctive to every Venetian.When Silvia Zanon goes to Campo San Provolo, where she teaches middle school, she knows it will take 23 minutes to walk there from her apartment on the Calle delle Carrozze. She leaves at 7:35 a.m. Memi, owner of a neighborhood trattoria, seated at a table reading the newspaper, looks up and nods. The young man collecting trash for the garbage barge mumbles a greeting. She turns onto the Campiello dei Morti and passes a wall draped with a white climbing rose; a bridge, two squares, another left in front of a former movie theater, now a trendy restaurant, and she proceeds on to the Frezzeria. Ahead is the Correr Museum and cleaning ladies on hands and knees with buckets and brushes. She crosses the Piazza San Marco, blissfully empty in early morning. "I step on the paving stones and fall in love with the city all over again," she says. Another bridge, a brisk walk across the Campo San Filippo e Giacomo, and she arrives. It is exactly 7:58 a.m.Listen. Venice should be heard as well as seen. At night the eye is not distracted by the radiance of gilded domes. The ear can discern the slam of wood shutters, heels tapping up and down the stone steps of bridges, the abbreviated drama of whispered conversations, waves kicked against the seawall by boats, the staccato of rain on canvas awnings, and always, always, the heavy, sad sound of bells. Most of all, the sound of Venice is the absence of the sound of cars.Often Franco Filippi, a bookstore owner and writer, cannot sleep, and so he gets up and threads his way through the maze of streets, flashlight in hand, stopping now and then to play a beam over facades of stucco and stone until the cylinder of light picks out a roundel of carved stone, called a patera, depicting some fantastic beast that slithers, prowls, or flies. It is then, while the city sleeps and he is rapt in the contemplation of a touchstone of its past, that he reclaims his Venice from the crowds that fill the streets, squares, and canals when it is day.Gherardo Ortalli, a professor of medieval history, finds his path less poetic. "When I go out in the campo with my friends, I have to stop because someone is taking a photograph of us as if we are aboriginals," he says. "Perhaps one day we are. You go and see a sign on a cage. 'Feed the Venetians.' When I arrived 30 years ago, the population was 120,000. Now it is less than 60,000."The decline seems inexorable. Last year alone, the resident population fell by 444. Ortalli thinks Venice will end up as simply a theme park for the rich, who will jet in to spend a day or two in their palazzo, then leave. It is 10 a.m., and he is headed toward a kiosk in the Campo Santa Margherita to buy a newspaper before going to his office, though you can hardly find the papers for the jetsam and flotsam of tourist kitsch: miniature masks, gondola pins, felt jester caps. "Everything is for sale," he sighs. "Even Venice."Meet the official charged with the solemn duty of managing the wear and tear of tourism. His name is Augusto Salvadori, and his card introduces him asDirector of TourismPromotion of Venice's Tradition,History, and CultureProtection of the Town's Proprietyand CleanlinessPrevention of the Wear Caused by the WavesStreet SignageLove is not too strong a word—in fact, it is inadequate to describe how Salvadori feels about Venice. He is not just the city's director of tourism and promoter of tradition; he is its defender. If Salvadori could command it, every balcony would be draped with geraniums. (He distributed 3,000 plants with that in mind.) Once, dining at a canalside restaurant, he leaned over the table to reprimand a passing gondolier for singing "O Sole Mio," a Neapolitan, not Vene­tian, song.In fall 2007 he dispatched a commando of volunteers to spread the gospel of neatness in the Piazza San Marco, to remind visitors to follow the commandments of good behavior: not to eat, drink, or sit anywhere other than in designated areas. "We are fighting for the dignity of Venice," Salvadori says. In spring 2008, he announced decorum week; 72,000 plastic bags were distributed to residents so that they could dispose of dog poop. Useful, except that no one provided extra trash cans for the used bags."The city is consumed by tourism," says Salvadori, seated in his office in the 16th-century Palazzo Contarini Mocenigo. "What do Venetians get in exchange?" A frown as his brow plummets. "Services are strained. During part of the year Venetians cannot elbow their way onto public transportation. The cost of garbage collection increases; so does the price of living." Does it ever, particularly when it comes to residential property. A 1999 law that eased regulations on the conversion of residential buildings to tourist accommodations exacerbated an ongoing housing shortage. Meanwhile, the number of hotels and guesthouses since 1999 has increased by 600 percent."Perhaps to help," Salvadori says, "we put a city tax on hotels and restaurants. They say tourists will not come—but I say, tourists won't come for a few euros?" He glares. "I cannot be worried about hotels. I have to think of the Venetians. My battle is for the city. Because Venice"—his voice softens, he touches his chest—"is my heart."Tourism has been part of the Venetian landscape since the 14th century, when pilgrims stopped en route to the Holy Land. With the Reformation of the 1500s, tourism lagged, but regained momentum in the 17th century as upper-class Europeans, intent on acquiring the fine sheen of cultural experience, embarked on a "grand tour."So, what's so different about tourism now? I ask Ortalli, after he has settled into his office. "Yes, there was the grand tour," he replies. "But then people were invested in hospitality. Now, Venice gets giant cruise ships. The ship is ten stories high. You can't understand Venice from ten stories up. You might as well be in a helicopter. But it's not important. You arrive in Venice, write a postcard, and remember what a wonderful evening you had."The malady is chronic. The onset of infection, says art historian Margaret Plant, dates to the 1880s, when the city "was fetishized, and its face was turned resolutely to the past. At that point zealously guarded Venice became a commodity city, a package of the totally picturesque. Its own citizens were confirmed as a lower order."The contagion seeps down streets, climbs bridges, and crosses the piazza. "There goes another piece of Venice," Silvia Zanon, the teacher, said sadly when La Cami­ceria San Marco, a clothing store located near the Piazza San Marco for 60 years, had to move to a smaller, less prime spot because the rent had tripled. The shop, quintessentially Venetian, tailored pajamas for the Duke of Windsor and sport shirts for Ernest Hemingway. "It's like leaving the house where you were born," said Susanna Cestari, who had worked there 32 years, packing boxes for the move.In August 2007, Molin Giocattoli, a toy store so popular an adjacent bridge was called the Bridge of Toys, closed. Since December 2007, ten hardware stores have gone out of business. In the Rialto market, souvenir sellers have replaced vendors who sold sausages, bread, or vegetables. Tourists will not notice. They do not visit Venice to buy an eggplant.They do, however, come to get married. The tourist machinery has incorporated weddings—720 in 2007. Predictably, nonresidents who married in Venice that year outnumbered residents by nearly three to one. Should you wish to tie the knot, the marriage office of the City of Venice will oblige for $2,400 on weekdays. On weekends, $5,500. Would the happy couple like the ceremony broadcast on the Internet? One hundred ninety dollars, if you please.As for Carnival—once a charming, neighborhood event, now a commercial frenzy ("a cultural hijacking," Robert C. Davis, a professor of history at Ohio State University, wrote in Venice, the Tourist Maze)—sensible Venetians leave town.One thing the Venetians haven't abandoned is their cynicism. When the exodus is complete, if the city ends up as nothing more than an exquisite, gilded bonbonnière, "Who will be the last Venetian left?" a woman whose family reached back generations was asked. "I don't know," she replied. "But certainly the last Venetian will want to be paid for it."Meanwhile, plans for the city's salvation appear and disappear with the regularity of the tides, but the stakes couldn't be higher: Tourism in Venice generates $2 billion a year in revenue, probably an underestimate because so much business is done off the books. It is, reports the University of Venice's International Center of Studies on the Tourist Economy, "the heart and soul of the Venetian economy—good and bad."Some people suggest that Venice's wounds are self-inflicted—the sequelae of the drive to wring every last euro, yen, and dollar out of tourism. "They don't want tourists," observes a former resident, "but they want their money. American tourists are best. They spend. Eastern Europeans bring their own food and water. Perhaps they buy a little plastic gondola."There is talk, always talk (this is Italy) about limiting tourists, taxing tourists, imploring them to avoid the high seasons of Easter and Carnival, but tourism—intertwined with the loss of resident population, complicated by the power of hoteliers, gondoliers, and water taxi drivers, who have an interest in maximizing the influx of visitors—defies simple solutions."Let me remind you, the loss of population … is not only a problem in Venice but in all historical towns, not only Italy," cautioned Mayor Cacciari. "The so-called exodus, which dates back very far in time, is deep rooted in the lodging issue."Redemption may be out of reach. "It is too late," Gherardo Ortalli, the historian, says. "Nineveh is finished. Babylon is finished. Venice will remain. That is, the stones will remain. The people won't." But for now there is still life as well as death in Venice. Franco Filippi walks at night in search of carvings on weathered walls. Silvia Zanon leaves for school, crosses San Marco only to fall in love with the city again, and, assuming it is in season, you can still manage to buy an eggplant."Venice may die," Cacciari insists. "But it will never become a museum. Never." Perhaps. In 1852 art critic John Ruskin wrote that the Doge's Palace would not be standing in five years. A century and a half later, it does.To glide from the slate green waters of the lagoon past San Giorgio Maggiore to the San Marco Basin, to approach the Doge's Palace with its tracery of arches and columns, to see it as the doges must have—enthroned on a gilded barge surging through a silver sea, oars dipping and rising, banners pulled taut by wind—is to see that beauty, difficult and bruised, survives.As does romance. What is Venice—so seductive, so lethally attractive—except the most sublime setting for the thrilling of the heart?For example, one fall day not long ago two children, 12 and 13, from Grosseto, a town in Tuscany, decided to run away. Their parents disapproved of their romance, so they saved and spent their allowance on a train to Venice. They walked narrow streets paved in stone and lingered on the bridges that vault the canals. Night approached, and with it the need for a place to stay. They arrived at the Hotel Zecchini, a modest guesthouse with an inviting orange-and-white awning. The clerk heard a small voice ask about a room, looked up, saw nothing, leaned over the desk, and looked into the faces of two children. Skeptical of their story about an aunt who would arrive soon, he gently questioned them, listened, then called the carabinieri."Such innocence and tenderness. They just wanted to be together," said Elisa Semen­zato, the hotel manager. When the carabinieri arrived, they took the pair on a tour of the city in their boat, then to district headquarters in a former convent and put them to bed in very separate rooms. The next day they were served a three-course meal on a table set with linens in a hall facing the 15th-century courtyard.Romance triumphs; reality intrudes. The parents, less than enchanted with the Romeo and Juliet narrative acted out by their children, arrived that afternoon to take them back to Grosseto, away from the soft ache of first love and the gilded beauty of Venice.Kisses end. Dreams vanish, and sometimes cities too. We long for the perfect ending, but the curtain falls along with our hearts.Beauty is so difficult.",
"Ancient mass graves containing more than 1,500 victims of the bubonic plague have been discovered on a small island in Italy's Venetian Lagoon.Workers came across the skeletons while digging the foundation for a new museum on Lazzaretto Vecchio, a small island in the lagoon's south, located a couple of miles from Venice's famed Piazza San Marco.The island is believed to be the world's first lazaret—a quarantine colony intended to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases.The lazaret was opened during the plague outbreaks that decimated Venice, as well as much of Europe, throughout the 15th and 16th centuries A.D.Its presence may have helped Venice recover more quickly during the devastating outbreaks."When plague struck the town, everybody sick or showing any suspect symptom were restricted on the island until they recovered or died," said Luisa Gambaro, an anthropologist of the University of Padua.Digging the foundation for Venice's archaeological museum on the eastern side of the island, workers came across the well-preserved human skeletons three years ago."We were called to attend the excavations, study the site, and rescue remains and artifacts," said Vincenzo Gobbo, an archaeologist of the University Ca' Foscari of Venice working with the Archaeological Superintendence of Veneto."In the last three years we collected more than 1,500 corpses and 150 boxes of artifacts," he added. "We estimate there are still thousands of skeletons buried beneath every meadow in Lazzaretto Vecchi."Researchers found the mass graves arranged in several layers. The oldest ones, dating back to the end of the 15th century, are long rectangular trenches. The skeletons inside are carefully lined and wrapped in sheets.Later graves are nothing more than large holes where monatti, or corpse carriers, hastily unloaded their carts."Plague outbreaks in the 16th century were far deadlier than the earlier ones," Gobbo said. "About 500 people a day used to die in Lazzaretto Vecchio. Monatti simply had no time to take care of the burials."The remains belong to men, women, and children alike. Some show Asian or African features, evidence of the cultural diversity that stemmed from the Republic of Venice's role as one of the most important commercial ports in Europe."Nobles or lower class didn't make any difference," Gambaro said. "All the sick were forced to stay on Lazzaretto Vecchio, and if they died, they were buried together."Among the skeletons, the archaeologists also found common artifacts such as pottery, coins, combs, and jewelry.The concept of a lazaret began in 1485, when a devastating plague outbreak hit Venice and killed even the doge, or the head of state, at the time, Giovanni Mocenigo.Venice's government built a public hospital on Lazzaretto Vecchio to isolate the infectious and curb the disease's spread.At the time the island was named Santa Maria di Nazareth, but people also called it Nazarethum or Lazaretum. The second name prevailed and eventually gave rise to the modern word "lazaret."But conditions in Lazzaretto Vecchio during plague outbreaks were far from modern hospital's standards."It looked like hell ... The sick lay three or four in a bed," wrote the 16th-century Venetian chronicler Rocco Benedetti."Workers collected the dead and threw them in the graves all day without a break. Often the dying ones and the ones too sick to move or talk were taken for dead and thrown on the piled corpses."The lucky ones who survived and recovered spent their convalescence on the near island of Lazzaretto Nuovo.Thanks to this policy, Venetians were able to curb the damage as the plague struck Europe again and again during the Renaissance.As workers continue working on the museum, scheduled to open on 2010, skeletons and artifacts will finish their journey by being cataloged and stored on Lazzaretto Nuovo.Researchers from across Italy will study the remains to learn more about society and everyday life in medieval and Renaissance Venice."By analyzing teeth and bones it may be possible to know what they used to eat and what kind of diseases affected them," Gambaro, of the University of Padua, said."Then part of the remains will be put on display in the new museum on Lazzaretto Vecchio," archaeologist Gobbo added. "The archaeological area will be open to visitors too."",
"In Anomabo, Ghana, an elder adjusts a young tourist’s grip on a traditional staff at Fort William, which formerly held enslaved Africans before their forced trans-Atlantic passage.Last summer in Ghana, Tiffany Heard followed her guide to his hometown of Kumasi. There, in a courtyard in the country’s second largest city, as locals chanted and sang, the 34-year-old travel planner from California waited for her new name.The ceremony was simple but significant. Names connect Africans with place and family; the absence of a name represents the absence of a history. When names were taken from slaves, individuals were severed from their ancestry. So for a black American to be named in Ghana was to be reattached to a community.In front of the Kumasi queen mother, a chief, the elders, and a host of locals, Heard was introduced to her African name: Akua (“Wednesday,” the day of her birth) Konadu (the name of the local family chosen for her to join). The five others in her group each received their own new name.“It was definitely a special moment for everybody,” says Heard. “To feel like I’ve reconnected, I’ve come back home.”That reconnection was what Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, had in mind when he announced that 2019 would be a “Year of Return.” The tourism initiative invited black people from across the diaspora to return to the African continent in 2019 to mark the 400 years since slave ships leaving West African coasts had carried their ancestors to the Americas.Many of those ships would have left from what is now Ghana. The region was at the center of the slave trade; Portuguese-built castles along the coast imprisoned captured Africans before sending them shackled and bare across the Atlantic.For black Americans, a return to Ghana is a trip back to where the atrocities of African-American slave history began.Follow the journey of these black scuba divers searching slave shipwrecks.But last year’s tourism campaign focused on much more than slavery. Travelers were encouraged to participate in Ghanaian Independence Day parades, join a paragliding festival, see documentary films, and explore street art.Yes, you could visit a Cape Coast slave castle (there are more than two dozen of them), but you could also seek connections through a pan-African cultural festival, dance alongside reggae artists, or hear the work of contemporary local poets.The collections on display at the National Museum of Ghana, in Accra, include historical objects, beaded works, musical instruments, currency, maps, and jewelry.The celebrities went first: Idris Elba, Naomi Campbell, Boris Kodjoe, and others all spoke to American media about the transformative experience of visiting the country. Soon, social media feeds were filling with images of everyday Americans in traditional Ashanti prints and modern headwraps. An end-of-the-year concert billed as Afrochella drew even more attention.Find out why diversity matters in travel.The results of the tourism campaign have been impressive. Its projected goal of attracting 500,000 foreign visitors was met, and doubled, by the year’s end. Among those visitors was T. Michelle Curry, a Detroit native whose company, “The Travel Africa Movement,” began planning trips specifically for black Americans two years ago. Last year she led her first group trip to Ghana.“I’ve seen so much beauty across the continent,” Curry says. “People have been so warm and welcoming, it’s just amazing.”International arrivals to Ghana increased 18 percent last year, according to Barbara Oteng-Gyasi, minister for tourism, arts, and culture. In 2019, Ghana saw nearly $1.87 billion in tourist revenue. Travel to Ghana specifically by U.S. citizens increased by 26 percent from January 2019 to September 2019, according to Ghana Immigration Services.The goal now is to build on that momentum. Oteng-Gyasi said that the tourism ministry intends to implement a campaign-oriented project, “Beyond the Year of Return—A Birthright,” over a 10-year period, with the aim of bringing in an estimated 4.3 million international travelers and approximately $8.3 billion from the tourism sector per year by 2027.The Ghana Tourism Association says another goal is to encourage investment (Marriott Hotels International is among the chains planning new hotels in the country) and even citizenship to help improve the heritage infrastructure of the country. A new program that waives some visa requirements will help.A $247-million airport terminal—capable of handling five million travelers a year, with an expansion potential of up to 6.5 million—has already opened in September 2018. This upgrade is part of the government’s plan to build an airport in each of the country’s 10 regions.And there’s more. Plans are underway to develop attractions meant to expand tourism options beyond the main centers and throughout the country.While no other African countries immediately jumped on Ghana’s Year of the Return successes, the region seems to have taken note. Benin, for one, announced a “Gate of Return Marathon and Festival” in partnership with actor Djimon Hounsou for the end of 2020.Many of the visitors to Ghana are planning return trips. Nicole Brewer, an African-American schoolteacher currently living and working in Oman, went to Ghana last January after an AncestryDNA test indicated that her genetic heritage was almost 20 percent Ghanaian.Historically, DNA testing has been disappointing for black Americans trying to trace their family trees. The slave trade meant they were treated as chattel, and many of the identifying features genealogical researchers rely on—full names, marriage records, census counts—aren’t available.But things are improving. Ancestry.com’s network of more than 16 million people now includes nine distinct regions in Africa. “As more people test, things are going to get refined and be more accurate, robust, and nuanced,” says Ancestry family historian Nicka Sewell-Smith.Cape Coast Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site, once imprisoned slaves before they were boarded on ships for the perilous journey to the Americas.This also means that, given time, results can change. In an email late last year, well after her Ghana trip, Brewer received news that she’s not as Ghanaian as she thought. It doesn’t bother her.“At the end of the day, that’s kind of irrelevant,” says Brewer. She noted the impact that a visit to Cape Coast Castle had on her. The castle, like many slave holding centers, has a “Door of No Return”—through which slaves would have made their last steps on the continent before being crammed into cargo holds for the chained passage to America. The site, Brewer noted, had been renamed the “Door of Return.”“For me to be able to return home, to be able to walk back through that door, something that nobody back then was able to do... I’m starting to cry just thinking about it,” she says. “I want more African Americans to have that same experience and to feel that powerful.”",
"In late August 1619, “20 and odd” captive Africans first touched the soil at Point Comfort (now Fort Monroe National Monument), part of England’s new colony in Virginia. These men and women had been stolen from their homes in Africa, forced to board a ship, and sailed for months into the unknown. The first Africans in an English colony, their arrival is considered by many historians to be the beginning of a 400-year story filled with tragedy, endurance, survival, and a legacy of resilience, inequality, and oppression.These first Africans in Virginia were not the first Africans in North America, but they were a significant part of the ever changing Atlantic world during the colonial era. Their travels and experiences represent those of more than 12.5 million other captives, who were taken from Africa to be sold in the Americas during the five centuries of the transatlantic slave trade. Their story marks an important historical transition, as the North American colonies began to turn away from indentured servitude and instead rely on chattel slavery. (See also: It was America's first colony. Then it was gone.)On the west coast of central Africa in the 1600s, the Portuguese were in the midst of a war with Ndongo, a powerful west African kingdom located between the Lukala and Kwanza rivers, in present-day Angola. The people of Ndongo lived in developed cities and towns surrounding their capital city, Kabasa. The capital was where royalty lived, along with approximately 50,000 citizens. In 1618, Portuguese forces aligned with Ndongo’s adversaries, neighboring Imbangala mercenaries, to invade the kingdom. They captured thousands of prisoners to sell into slavery.These political relationships were spawned 135 years earlier. In 1483, the Portuguese first forged a relationship with the Kingdom of Kongo. Portuguese explorers aimed to spread Catholicism in Africa, colonize both people and land, and grow rich. Upon developing a trade deal with the Portuguese, the Kongo King Nkuwu converted to Catholicism. After his death, his son and heir, King Nzinga Mbemba, took the name King Afonso I and declared the kingdom a Catholic state, firmly bonding the two nations.Queen Ana Nzinga was born in 1583, and in 1624, at the age of 42, she became the Queen of Ndongo, just five years after the Angolans arrived in Virginia. Her reign came amidst the ongoing war between the Portuguese, and her people of Ndongo. She attempted to shift the political partnership between the states, offering herself as a convert to Catholicism in return for the termination of slave raids that were devastating her people. Portugal’s colonial Governor agreed, and acted as her godfather for the conversion. Queen Nzinga maintained a strong political relationship with the Portuguese for two years, but in 1626 they betrayed her and began taking Ndongo captives again. As a result, she established a nearby state, Matamba, which acted as a refuge for victims of the trade, meanwhile ordering her militia to attack the Portuguese who had taken over her former state of Ndongo. Queen Nzinga ruled until her death at the age of 81.In 1512, Afonso I negotiated an agreement with the Portuguese giving them rights to land and direct access to Kongo’s prisoners of war, who would be sold into the transatlantic slave trade. This arrangement provided a model that other European nations and western and central African kingdoms would follow for centuries afterward. (See also: Tracing slaves to their African homelands.)The first people sold were mostly prisoners of war. African kingdoms were often in conflict, at times absorbing smaller nations or kinship groups into themselves. The vast ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity in these kingdoms allowed for easily identifiable differences among groups, making it easier for kingdoms to sell their enemies in exchange for weapons and goods to expand and protect their territories. Grand empires, such as the Kongo, Dahomey, Yoruba, Benin, and Asante, were vying for wealth and power in their regions, and Europeans were in need of laborers to build their colonies. It was the ideal circumstance to bring about the largest forced migration in human history.By 1619, the transatlantic slave trade had been in existance for more than 100 years. As early as 1501, both Portugal and Spain began building up their young colonies in Brazil and Uruguay through slave labor. Other European colonizers soon followed; Great Britain in the 1550s, France in the 1570s, the Netherlands in the 1590s, and Denmark in the 1640s. In the 1500s, the Spanish were the first to bring enslaved Africans to North America as part of their colonization efforts in Florida and the Carolinas. By 1620, close to 520,000 captured and enslaved African men, women, and children had already been sold into chattel slavery by several European nations. The Spanish and Portuguese colonies alone accounted for approximately 475,000 enslaved people.In just two years, 1618 and 1619, the Portuguese-Imbangala alliance resulted in the capture and enslavement of thousands of Ndongo people, filling at least 36 ships with human cargo. These captives would be sent to the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Central and South America to work as laborers. It was through this arrangement that slavery would spread to British North America in 1619, when chaos intervened and the destiny of those “20 and odd” Africans was redirected to a place called the Colony of Virginia on the Atlantic coast.They entered the Middle Passage, a phrase used to describe both the trip itself and the shipping of people from the coasts of Africa to the European colonies in the Americas. Conditions aboard the ships were dreadful; a lack of food and water, physical abuse, and severe overcrowding led to the death of approximately 30 percent of the captives on any given ship. To survive the Middle Passage was a feat in itself: Hundreds of ships sank, small-and large-scale revolts broke out, and disease and starvation were widespread. The San Juan Bautista was no exception, as sickness took hold aboard the vessel. Of the 350 captured and enslaved African men, women, and children, roughly 150 died on the journey west.In addition to the trauma of widespread death on the San Juan Bautista, the crew was also concerned about English privateers, who were assigned to take any goods aboard Spanish and Portuguese ships. By this period, both Spain and Portugal had colonized much of the Americas, and the British were in fierce competition for both land and power in the so-called New World. In previous decades, Englishmen such as Sirs Humphrey Gilbert, Richard Grenville, John Hawkins, Walter Raleigh, and Francis Drake were sent by Queen Elizabeth I to the Atlantic and Caribbean, where they attacked and seized goods from Spanish ships and colonies.It was because of this complex political climate that the Africans aboard the San Juan Bautista found themselves in an unexpected turn of events. In late July or early August 1619, just weeks before the Ndongo captives would have been sold through the port of Veracruz, the ship was attacked by pirates searching for Spanish gold.The White Lion, commanded by Cornish man John Jope, and the Treasurer, owned by Sir Robert Rich, the Earl of Warwick, and led by Captain Daniel Elfrith, were assigned the duty of intercepting and seizing Spanish goods in the Atlantic. The English wanted these privateers to slow down Spanish settlement and empowered them to attack Spanish ships. This particular encounter, in the bay of Campeche, left all three ships damaged, and the English pirates stole approximately 50 Africans as part of their overall booty.After the battle, the San Juan Bautista continued to Veracruz, where 147 surviving enslaved Africans would be sold. The Treasurer and White Lion left the battle and sailed toward the eastern Caribbean. The 50 Angolans on board the two ships had lived through the Middle Passage from Luanda to the Gulf of Mexico. They had witnessed death and endured despair and violence, and had survived it all—including an attack by pirates.The English pirates split the captive Africans into two groups between their ships. Both vessels sailed toward the British Colony of Virginia, which was established in 1607. The White Lion arrived first, landing at Point Comfort, in present-day Hampton, Virginia. English colonist John Rolfe recorded the event:...a Dutchman of Warr of the burden of a 160 tunnes arrived at Point Comfort, the Commandors name Capt. Jope. He brought not any thing but 20. And odd Negroes, w[hich] the Governo[r] and Cape Merchant bought for victuals.His clinical summation is the only documentation of the event and falls short of capturing any details of that day in late August 1619 as “20 and odd” Africans placed their feet on the soil of new continent. As they stood together as the first Africans in British North America, no one recorded their reactions or opinions about leaving their homes in Angola. Their perspective was lost in time.The second ship, the Treasurer, arrived a few days later for a quick trade at nearby Kicotan (now Hampton), Virginia, but quickly departed for Bermuda. They traded their remaining goods and sold the rest of the Africans upon their arrival. The English colonies were expanding and the captives supplied them with an instant and distinguishable work force. The Spanish and Portuguese capture and enslavement of Africans as laborers in the Atlantic world was common practice by the time Jamestown was established, and the British followed suit. By the end of the 17th century, the colonies’ reliance on indentured servants had shifted toward that of enslaved African people. (See also: Jamestown colonists resorted to cannibalism.)By 1619 the English were having realizing success in North America. Thirteen years earlier, the London-based Virginia Company had sent three ships, captained by Christopher Newport, to colonize the eastern coast of North America. On May 14, 1607, he and his all-male passengers landed near the James River, in an area ruled by the Powhatan. More settlers, including women, followed, and Jamestown became the first successful English settlement in the Americas. In July 1619, Virginia held the first gathering of the General Assembly, marking the formality of law in the young colony.By March 1620, 32 Africans were documented living in Virginia; 15 men and 17 women. The first American-born African likely was either at Flowerdew Hundred Plantation or at Kicotan, both nearby settlements on the James River. In 1624, this small African population had shrunk to only 21, most likely from death due to illness, the 1622 Powhatan uprising, or because some were sold back into the Atlantic trade.There is no record stating the official legal status of these first Africans in Virginia. There was already an established racial caste in the Portuguese and Spanish colonies, and it is fair to presume the English followed this custom. They most likely saw these Africans as something other than indentured servants, a status common for their poor white counterparts.Early Virginia census records show that many Africans were never listed by name, just their “race,” and cited their appearance as starkly different from that of the colonists. This distinction marks the beginnings of a racial caste, formalized into Virginia law by the early 1650s, the enslaved status of African women was written into Virginia law as their children automatically inherited their status and were enslaved at birth, regardless of the father’s identity. This set up slavery as a permanent, hereditary condition. A series of laws, called slave codes, followed, each one cementing racism firmly in the DNA of the United States.Historians know few details about the first “20 and odd” Africans in Virginia. It is assumed that they spoke forms of the Bantu language, either Kikongo, from the Kongo Kingdom, or Kimbundu, from the Ngongo empire. Their documented names are of Spanish origin and most likely were assigned to them during their time on the San Juan Bautista. A few of them, and some of those who followed shortly after in the early 1620s, left clues to their lives in Virginia’s courts and records. In 1624, court records show the testimony of “John Phillips” and the census lists “Anthony” and “Isabella” as living in Elizabeth City, and “Angelo (Angela)” at Jamestown. It is this brevity that keeps the details of their lives absent from most written records and hinders current understanding of their experiences.A woman named Angela was one of the captured Angolans who arrived in Virginia on the Treasurer in 1619. She was listed as “Angelo” in the 1624 census, living in Lieutenant William Pierce’s home in Jamestown, along with three white indentured servants. Although her name sounds masculine, she is listed as a woman and referred to as both Angelo and Angela. She was born in Angola around 1600, and her name was likely changed by her enslavers. In 2017, archaeologists at Jamestown found at her site a cowrie shell, which likely held special signigicance to her. In West and central Africa, cowrie shells were used as currency, adornment, and in religious practices.Some of the English colonists might have failed to see the ethnic and religious diversity among their captives. But many slavers sought out particular ethnic groups for their skills. In addition to farming, these kingdoms were known for their iron work, masonry, glassmaking, weaving, and mining—all skills needed in the development of the colonies. The Kongo were well-known metal workers and brought with them unmatched skill sets.Angola was home to the Kongo Kingdom, which converted to Catholicism in the 15th century, but inhabitants still retained many of their own religious practices. Traditional rituals and beliefs, such as ancestor worship, were intermixed with Catholic rites. Archaeologists working at colonial sites have found traces of it in the material culture; the Kongo cosmogram, a cross-like mark, often with a circle encompassing it, can be found carved into objects such as pipes and bowls and into walls and metal throughout the African diaspora. This symbol, often mistaken for a cross, had a double meaning; it could pass as Christian while also performing essential ritual purposes. This symbol was used to pray to and conjure the African ancestors for protection.Handmade pipes, like the ones excavated at the Cliffs Plantation at Stratford Hall (above), date to the 1650s and were handmade by the enslaved Africans who lived there. The designs etched in the clay are specific to their ancestral cultures. Similar designs are found carved into objects throughout the African diaspora, which can yield clues about the dispersions of African populations in the early colonies. These pipes may also hold the DNA of the people who used them. In 2019, scholars were able to collect DNA from a 19th-century clay pipe found in Maryland and trace it back to modern-day Sierra Leone, most likely to the Mende people in West Africa.It is through the markings carved into pipes and other material objects, mostly found through archaeological investigations, that historians are given a glimpse into the Africans’ personal lives. Their religion, ethnicity, and culture survived the Middle Passage and took hold in the colonies. The first Africans in Virginia were followed by more than 400,000 people captured and brought directly from West and central African to the North American slave ports, from New England to New Orleans. Written records are mostly limited to names, sex, and monetary value, and occasionally occupation; more detailed descriptions typically are found only in advertisements about runaway slaves. This leaves historians with a limited amount of information, and as such, a heavy reliance on archaeological data and oral tradition. (See also: Last American slave ship is discovered in Alabama.)While slavery existed for millennia in other cultures around the world before 1619, it transformed significantly in the Americas. Traditional African slavery was vastly different from what developed in the colonies. In African kingdoms, slavery was not permanent nor was it inherited. Children of slaves were not automatically enslaved, and they could be socially and politically mobile. (See also: Nat Turner, an American rebel's complicated legacy.)In the “New World,” slavery transformed. It was permanent and hereditary. The enslaved had few or no civil rights. They could be bought and sold at their owners’ discretion. The social construct of race became tightly tethered to legal status, causing problems that ripple down to the present day.As the 400th anniversary of the 1619 arrival approached, more people actively tried to trace their roots back to their African ancestors’ arrival in the colonies. Some are fortunate, like members of the William Tucker 1624 Society. Many members can trace their lineage back to William Tucker, believed to be the first African American child born in Virginia. Their surname was recorded centuries ago, and they have remained connected to this distinct family line.Unfortunately, the Tuckers are the exception, as most African Americans can only trace their ancestors back to the late 19th century, following emancipation, when African Americans were free to record their own full legal names. Scientific advances in genetics have also given people new tools to find their ancestors via DNA, but creating a full family tree remains unlikely. Few family histories will ever be complete, yet another legacy of the inhumane treatment of enslaved Africans and their descendants. (See also: Their ancestors survived slavery. Can their descendants save the town they built?)Looking back to 1619, one realizes it is time to recognize how racist ideology fed the colonization of the Americas and the systematic enslavement and oppression of both Native Americans and captive Africans. Looking forward, one must also see how necessary it is for humanity to try to tell the full story of the millions of Africans who were stolen away.",
"An analysis of skeletons found in the El Chorro de Maíta suggests the individuals came from West Africa and Mesoamerica, as well as Cuba.More than twelve million people crossed from Africa to the New World as slaves. Historians know a good deal about the African ports where they embarked, the slave ships that carried them across the ocean, and the destinations of these enslaved peoples.But they know surprisingly little about where in Africa these masses of people originally came from.Now, thanks to recent advances in genetic techniques, scientists are filling in this important gap in the tragic African diaspora.“This will change our understanding of population and migration histories,” says Hannes Schroeder, a biological anthropologist at the University of Copenhagen. “What was just potential is now being fulfilled.”One example comes from a 17th century cemetery on the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of St. Martin. When archaeologists excavated the site in 2010, they noticed filed teeth in the skulls of two men and a woman. The three individuals were between 25 and 40 years old when they died in the late 1600s.Since teeth filing was a common practice in sub-Saharan Africa, it was a good bet that the individuals were enslaved Africans brought to the colony in the days of sugar plantations.Just five years ago, that would have been the end of the story. An attempt to extract DNA from the skeletons to learn more about their identity would have been quixotic, since hot and humid weather degrades genetic material.“These were badly preserved,” said Schroeder. “They had been laying under a Caribbean beach for four hundred years.” By contrast, biologists in 2012 readily sequenced the entire genome from Otzi, the frozen “ice man” who died in the Alps five thousand years ago.After months of careful work, however, Schroeder’s team was able to extract DNA from the St. Martin individuals using a new procedure called whole-genome capture. Devised at Stanford University in California, this technique concentrates the degraded genes, providing enough material to sequence.By comparing the results with a database from modern-day Africans, the researchers determined that all three people came from different parts of that continent. One of the men likely came from what is today northern Cameroon, while the other man and the woman may have originated in Ghana or Nigeria to the south.The results showed that the slaves, who may have traveled on the same ship, were a mix of ethnicities likely speaking mutually unintelligible languages.The scientists failed to pinpoint the origin more exactly because the genetic database of modern Africans is limited and far less developed than that for Europeans.Schroeder says that as the African database improves, it will be simpler to identify the homelands of individuals captured and shipped to the Americas. Ancient DNA from West Africa, which is also still sorely lacking, could strengthen the accuracy, he added.Filed teeth are one of many clues researchers can use to trace a skeleton's origins.Schroeder and a team of researchers are now investigating human remains from St. Helena, a British colony in the South Atlantic most famous as Napoleon’s place of exile.In the early and mid-19th century, the British Royal Navy patrolled the African coast to intercept slave ships. More than 26,000 slaves on board these vessels were taken to St. Helena from 1840 to 1872. Between 5,000 and 8,000 died after their ordeal on the seas and were buried on the island.During recent construction of a new airport, archaeologists found 325 individuals in 178 graves who appear to have been among the people who were freed only to die shortly thereafter.“This is a unique window into the transatlantic slave trade in the era of abolition,” said Marcela Sandoval-Velasco, a University of Copenhagen researcher involved in the project.Out of 63 tooth samples, Sandoval-Velasco and her colleagues managed to extract DNA from 20 people, including 17 males and three females.All but two were Bantu speakers probably from West Central Africa, though not all from the same groups. “The findings suggest that these people were of multiple origins,” said Sandoval-Velasco. “But we need more extensive sampling from Africa to understand the slave-trade dynamics of the time.”Meanwhile, an international team is analyzing the St. Helena bones using other methods, such as isotopic analysis, to discover what their shape and makeup might say about the enslaved Africans’ origins, diet, and overall health.These metallic ornaments from Colombia were found in an indigenous burial.Such methods also will help illuminate how and where Native Americans were enslaved in the early centuries of Spanish and Portuguese colonization of the New World.In an early 16th-century cemetery in southeastern Cuba called El Chorro de Maita, archaeologists found 133 people in 108 burials. This is the only cemetery in Cuba known to include native Taino people, according to Roberto Valcarcel Rojas at the Netherlands’ University of Leiden, who has studied the remains and artifacts.Isotope analysis suggests that individuals came from West Africa and Mesoamerica, as well as from Cuba. The Mesoamericans may be from Mayan populations on the Yucatan peninsula, and their presence in Cuba points to a European-run slave trade that included today’s Mexico as well as Africa.So far, Schroeder has attempted without much success to extract DNA from ten Cuban samples. "We were able to confirm the Native American identity of a handful of individuals, but to be able to trace their specific origins we need more data," he said.Schroeder and his colleagues are optimistic that new techniques ultimately will liberate the genetic heritage of enslaved peoples, an important history that otherwise went largely unrecorded. “In the not too distant future, we hope we can say more,” he said.",
"Archaeologists have discovered the first physical evidence of cannibalism by desperate English colonists driven by hunger during the Starving Time of 1609-1610 at Jamestown, Virginia (map)—the first permanent English settlement in the New World.The announcement was made by a team of researchers from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, Historic Jamestowne, and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at a press conference May 1 in Washington, D.C.There are five historical accounts written by or about Jamestown colonists that reference cannibalism, but this is the first time it’s been proven, said William Kelso, director of archeology at Historic Jamestowne.“This is a very rare find,” said James Horn, vice president of research for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. “It is the only artifactual evidence of cannibalism by Europeans at any European colony—Spanish, French, English, or Dutch—throughout the colonial period from about 1500 to 1800.”Portions of the butchered skull and shinbone of a 14-year-old girl from England, dubbed “Jane” by researchers, were unearthed by Jamestown archaeologists last year. They found the remains about 2.5 feet (0.8 meters) down in a 17th century trash deposit in the cellar of a building built in 1608 inside the James Fort site.Kelso then asked Doug Owsley, head of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, to examine the remains and determine if she was killed or cannibalized.Kelso said he hadn't believed previous historical accounts regarding cannibalism. He thought they were politically motivated, intended to discredit the Virginia Company—the stockholders who provisioned and financed the settlement."Now, I know the accounts are true," he said.Since the excavation of James Fort began in 1994, the discovery is second only to the discovery of the fort, he added.The findings answer a longstanding question among historians about the occurrence of cannibalism at the settlement during the winter of 1609, when about 80 percent of the colonists died. (Read about the real story of Jamestown in National Geographic magazine.)HesitationOwsley described multiple chop and cut marks on the girl’s skull that were made by one or more assailants after she died. “They were clearly interested in cheek meat, muscles of the face, tongue, and brain,” he said. Jane’s hair was not removed.One of the foremost forensic anthropologists in the world, Owsley has analyzed numerous skeletal remains of prehistoric people who were victims of cannibalism. Their bones were similar to Jane's in that they had cut marks and were splintered and fragmented, he said.Four closely spaced chop marks in her forehead indicated a failed attempt to split her skull open, Owsley said. The close proximity of the unsuccessful blows indicates that she was already dead, or they would have been more haphazard, he explained.The back of her skull was then cracked open by a series of chops by a light weight axe or cleaver, he said.Cleaver blades and knives excavated from the Jamestown site were compared to the blows, and Owsley said he thinks a cleaver was used.There were also numerous cuts, saw marks, and gouges along her lower jaw made by the tip of a knife to get to the meat, and to remove throat tissue and the tongue, he said.Owsley said the cutting was not done by an experienced butcher, except possibly the chops to the shinbone. “There is a hesitancy, trial, and tentativeness in the marks that is not seen in animal butchery,” he said.“The desperation and overwhelming circumstances faced by the James Fort colonists during the winter of 1609-1610 are reflected in the postmortem treatment of this girl’s body,” Owsley added.Although only part of the skull is still intact, researchers were able to produce a facial reconstruction of Jane by digitally creating a 3-D skull.Historic Jamestowne’s Kelso said that settling Jamestown was “a very dark undertaking.” This evidence of cannibalism “almost puts you in the time,” he added. (Learn about the harsh realities of life in Jamestown.)BackstorySince only ten percent of Jane’s skeleton has been recovered, researchers have not been able to tell much about her story, but they do know by examining her shinbone that she was 14 years old.Based on isotope studies of her third molar, the high nitrogen content meant Jane may have been from a high-status family or served as their maid.Elevated nitrogen levels indicate that she ate a lot of protein, which was scarce and expensive, said Kari Bruwlheide, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian who works with Owsley.Researchers also know that she was probably from the southern coast of England, based on a comparison of oxygen isotopes in her tooth and oxygen isotopes found in groundwater samples from the area. The water she consumed while her permanent teeth were forming during infancy helps to pinpoint where she was born.A study of the carbon isotopes in her bones indicated she was eating a mostly European diet, which means that Jane had not been in Jamestown for long before her death, Bruwelheide said.A Desperate SituationAccording to Horn, of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Jane probably arrived at Jamestown in August of 1609 on one of six ships from England that straggled into the fort after surviving a hurricane during their crossing.The new arrivals’ food stores were spoiled or depleted—most of their provisions were lost when the flagship Sea Venture shipwrecked during the storm—and many of them were in poor health, he said.The Jamestown colonists were already starving when the 300 new settlers arrived, having suffered from diseases and food shortages.Increasing demands for food from nearby Indian tribes, coupled with severe drought conditions, caused relationships with the Powhatan Indians—a powerful chiefdom that extended across much of Virginia’s coastal region—to deteriorate.The colony’s leader, Captain John Smith, who had been wounded in an explosion, left with the fleet on its return trip to England, leaving Jamestown rudderless.By November, the Powhatans launched a war against the English, laying siege to Jamestown and cutting the colonists off from outside help. “Conditions became increasingly desperate,” Horn said.At first the settlers ate their horses, then their dogs and cats. Jamestown residents also ate rats, mice, and snakes, according to a firsthand account by George Percy, who became the colony’s temporary leader after John Smith left.Percy writes that some colonists ate their boots, shoes, and any other leather they could find. Others left the fort to search for roots in the woods, but were killed by Powhatan warriors.“Nothing Was Spared”As the siege continued into the winter, Percy wrote in an eyewitness account: "And now famine beginning to look ghastly and pale in every face that nothing was spared to maintain life and to do those things which seem incredible, as to dig up dead corpse out of graves and to eat them, and some have licked up the blood which hath fallen from their weak fellows."According to several colonists, one man killed his pregnant wife and chopped her into pieces, which he then salted and ate for food. He was executed for murder."Only in the most desperate of circumstances would the English have turned to cannibalism," Horn said. He believed the accounts because he said there was no reason for Percy to write falsely about something that would reflect poorly on his leadership.By spring of 1610, only about 60 people living at the fort had survived, according to Kelso’s calculations. How many of the dead were cannibalized is unknown, but Jane was not an isolated case, according to historical accounts.The colony was saved that spring by the arrival of settlers who had been shipwrecked with the Sea Venture in Bermuda—they had built themselves a new boat—who brought in much-needed supplies. They were followed soon after by Lord de la Warr, Jamestown’s first governor, who brought in additional supplies—a year’s worth—and even more colonists.Upon his arrival, De la Warr ordered a clean up of the fort. Trash, including Jane's remains, were deposited in cellars and pits throughout the settlement.Jamestown endured and colonists kept coming. "They kept their foothold and kept the Spanish from claiming all of North America," Horn said."This discovery underlines the incredible challenges each colonist faced in establishing European settlements in the New World. There were scores that never lasted more than 6 to 12 months."A public exhibition about the discovery and investigation of Jane’s remains, along with the evidence of cannibalism, her facial reconstruction, and the circumstances that led to the Starving Time will open at the Archaearium at Historic Jamestowne, on Jamestown Island, on May 3.",
"A mural of the Clotilda adorns a concrete embankment in Africatown, a community near Mobile founded by Africans illegally transported to Alabama aboard the slave ship. Some of their descendants still live in the neighborhood.The schooner Clotilda—the last known ship to bring enslaved Africans to America’s shores—has been discovered in a remote arm of Alabama’s Mobile River following an intensive yearlong search by marine archaeologists."Descendants of the Clotilda survivors have dreamed of this discovery for generations," says Lisa Demetropoulos Jones, executive director of the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC) and the State Historic Preservation Officer. "We’re thrilled to announce that their dream has finally come true."One hundred and nine African captives survived the brutal, six-week passage from West Africa to Alabama in Clotilda’s cramped hold. Originally built to transport cargo, not people, the schooner was unique in design and dimensions—a fact that helped archaeologists identify the wreck.The captives who arrived aboard Clotilda were the last of an estimated 389,000 Africans delivered into bondage in mainland America from the early 1600s to 1860. Thousands of vessels were involved in the transatlantic trade, but very few slave wrecks have ever been found.(See how archaeologists pieced together clues to identify the long-lost slave ship.)"The discovery of the Clotilda sheds new light on a lost chapter of American history," says Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the National Geographic Society, which supported the search. "This finding is also a critical piece of the story of Africatown, which was built by the resilient descendants of America’s last slave ship."Rare firsthand accounts left by the slaveholders as well as their victims offer a one-of-a-kind window into the Atlantic slave trade, says Sylviane Diouf, a noted historian of the African diaspora."It’s the best documented story of a slave voyage in the Western Hemisphere," says Diouf, whose 2007 book, Dreams of Africa in Alabama, chronicles the Clotilda’s saga. "The captives were sketched, interviewed, even filmed," she says, referring to some who lived into the 20th century. "The person who organized the trip talked about it. The captain of the ship wrote about it. So we have the story from several perspectives. I haven’t seen anything of that sort anywhere else."In 1927 Cudjo Lewis, then one of the last living Clotilda survivors, shared his life story with anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston. Her book Barracoon, finally published in 2018, includes Lewis's telling of the harrowing voyage aboard Clotilda.Clotilda’s story began when Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Mobile landowner and shipbuilder, allegedly wagered several Northern businessmen a thousand dollars that he could smuggle a cargo of Africans into Mobile Bay under the nose of federal officials.Importing slaves into the United States had been illegal since 1808, and southern plantation owners had seen prices in the domestic slave trade skyrocket. Many, including Meaher, were advocating for reopening the trade.Meaher chartered a sleek, swift schooner named Clotilda and enlisted its builder, Captain William Foster, to sail it to the notorious slave port of Ouidah in present-day Benin to buy captives. Foster left West Africa with 110 young men, women, and children crowded into the schooner’s hold. One girl reportedly died during the brutal six-week voyage. Purchased for $9,000 in gold, the human cargo was worth more than 20 times that amount in 1860 Alabama.After transferring the captives to a riverboat owned by Meaher’s brother, Foster burned the slaver to the waterline to hide their crime. Clotilda kept her secrets over the decades, even as some deniers contended that the shameful episode never occurred.Patricia Frazier carries the flag of Benin, the modern nation once ruled by the kingdom of Dahomey, who sold more than a hundred captives to the captain of the Clotilda. "If they find that ship, I think it will make people more aware of our history," says Frazier. "Sometimes you need something tangible to spur those memories."After the Civil War ended and slavery was abolished, the Africans longed to return to their home in West Africa. Lacking the means, they managed to buy small plots of land north of Mobile, where they formed their own tight-knit community that came to be known as Africatown. There they made new lives for themselves but never lost their African identity. Many of their descendants still live there today and grew up with stories of the famous ship that brought their ancestors to Alabama."If they find evidence of that ship, it's going to be big," descendant Lorna Woods predicted earlier this year. "All Mama told us would be validated. It would do us a world of good."Mary Elliott, a curator at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, agrees."There are many examples today—the Tulsa race riots of 1921, this story, even the Holocaust—where some people say it never happened. Now, because of the archaeology, the archival research, the science combined with the collective memories of the community, it can't be refuted. They are now connected to their ancestors in a tangible way, knowing this story is true." (Their ancestors survived slavery. Can their descendants save the town they built?)A bust of Cudjo Lewis, one of the last Clotilda survivors to pass away, sits at the entrance of Union Missionary Baptist Church, which he helped found.The Old Plateau Cemetery—also known as the Africatown Cemetery—became the final resting place for many Clotilda survivors who settled the community, including Lewis.Several attempts to locate Clotilda’s remains have been made over the years, but the Mobile-Tensaw Delta is rife with sloughs, oxbows, and bayous, as well as scores of shipwrecks from more than three centuries of maritime activity. Then in January 2018 Ben Raines, a local journalist, reported that he had discovered the remains of a large wooden ship during an abnormally low tide. The AHC, which owns all abandoned ships in Alabama’s state waters, called in the archaeology firm Search, Inc., to investigate the hulk.The vessel in question turned out to be another ship, but the false alarm focused national attention on the long-lost slaver. The incident also prompted the AHC to fund further research in partnership with the National Geographic Society and Search, Inc.Researchers combed through hundreds of original sources from the period and analyzed records of more than 2,000 ships that were operating in the Gulf of Mexico during the late 1850s. They discovered that Clotilda was one of only five Gulf-built schooners then insured. Registration documents provided detailed descriptions of the schooner, including its construction and dimensions.Maritime archaeologist James Delgado scans a section of the Mobile River during the search for Clotilda’s final resting place."Clotilda was an atypical, custom-built vessel," says maritime archaeologist James Delgado of Search, Inc. "There was only one Gulf-built schooner 86 feet long with a 23-foot beam and a six-foot, 11-inch hold, and that was Clotilda."Records also noted that the schooner was built of southern yellow pine planking over white oak frames and was outfitted with a 13-foot-long centerboard that could be raised or lowered as needed to access shallow harbors.Forensic scientist Frankie West examines samples of wood from the ship's hold in hopes of recovering DNA from captives' blood or bodily fluids.National Geographic engineer Arthur Clarke analyzed a nail from the wreck and found that it was nearly 99 percent pure iron, consistent with fasteners used in shipbuilding in Alabama in the 1850s.Based on their research of possible locations, Delgado and Alabama state archaeologist Stacye Hathorn focused on a stretch of the Mobile River that had never been dredged. Deploying divers and an array of devices—a magnetometer for detecting metal objects, a side-scan sonar for locating structures on and above the river bottom, and a sub-bottom profiler for detecting objects buried beneath the mucky riverbed—they discovered a veritable graveyard of sunken ships.Prior to the state survey, Raines continued his own search for the wreck, enlisting researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) to map the contours of the riverbed and detect any submerged objects. The USM survey revealed the presence of a wooden wreck bearing some hallmarks of a 19th-century vessel."The dimensions of the ship have not been determined yet,” Raines reported in June 2018. “It also remains unclear what type of vessel was found. Answering those questions will take a more thorough and invasive examination, precisely the expertise of Search, Inc."Delgado’s team easily eliminated most of the potential wrecks: wrong size, metal hull, wrong type of wood. But the vessel Raines and the USM survey had highlighted stood out from the rest.Over the next ten months, Delgado’s team analyzed the sunken vessel’s design and dimensions, the type of wood and metal used in its construction, and evidence that it had burned. It "matched everything on record about Clotilda," Delgado said.Samples of wood recovered from Target 5 are white oak and southern yellow pine from the Gulf coast. The archaeologists also found the remains of a centerboard of the correct size.Metal fasteners from its hull are made of hand-forged pig iron, the same type known to have been used on Clotilda. And there’s evidence that the hull was originally sheathed with copper, as was then common practice for oceangoing merchant vessels.No nameplate or other inscribed artifacts conclusively identified the wreck, Delgado says, "but looking at the various pieces of evidence, you can reach a point beyond reasonable doubt."Meaher State Park is named for the prominent Mobile family who donated waterfront property for the preserve. In 1860 Captain Timothy Meaher bet a large sum that he could import African slaves on Clotilda without being caught. He won the wager.A replica of the Africatown Freedom Bell stands in the courtyard of the Mobile County Training School. Local legend says the original bell came from Clotilda.The wreck of Clotilda now carries the dreams of Africatown, which has suffered from declining population, poverty, and a host of environmental insults from heavy industries that surround the community. Residents hope that the wreck will generate tourism and bring businesses and employment back to their streets. Some have even suggested it be raised and put on display.The community was recently awarded nearly $3.6 million from the BP Deepwater Horizon legal settlement to rebuild a visitor center destroyed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. But what’s left of the burned-out wreck is in very poor condition, says Delgado. Restoring it would cost many millions of dollars.But a national slave ship memorial—akin to the watery grave of the U.S.S. Arizona in Pearl Harbor—might be an option. There visitors could reflect on the horrors of the slave trade and be reminded of Africa’s enormous contribution to the making of America. (Read about 13 museums and monuments that connect to important moments in African-American history.)"We are still living in the wake of slavery," says Paul Gardullo, director of the Center for the Study of Global Slavery at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and a member of the Slave Wrecks Project that was involved in the search for Clotilda. “We continue to be confronted by slavery. It keeps popping up because we haven’t dealt with this past. If we do our work right, we have an opportunity not just to reconcile, but to make some real change.”",
"It’s cold and gray outside the historic Mobile County Training School, but inside it’s as warm as an Alabama family reunion. More than 200 people have come together for the first gathering of the descendants of the Clotilda, the last slave ship to bring African captives to U.S. shores in July 1860.Deborah Ferguson welcomes Clotilda descendants and visitors to a recent gathering at the Mobile County Training School in Africatown. Their ancestors “survived slavery, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow,” she says. “They survived it all.”Drawings of Africatown founders Pollee Allen (left), Ossa Keeby (center), and Abache Lewis are on display at the Mobile County Training School.After being freed by Union soldiers at the end of the Civil War, more than 30 of the Africans settled among the woods and marshes of nearby Magazine Point in north Mobile. Blending African traditions with American folkways, they built houses, planted gardens, tended livestock, hunted, fished, and farmed. They founded a church and the first black school in Mobile—which, with the help of Booker T. Washington, became the Mobile County Training School. Together they created a tight-knit, self-reliant community that took care of its own. It came to be known as Africatown.Patricia Frazier carries the flag of Benin, the modern nation once ruled by the King of Dahomey, who sold 110 captives to the captain of the Clotilda. “If they find that ship, I think it will make people more aware of our history,” says Frazier. “Sometimes you need something tangible to spur those memories.”“This little community was self-sustaining,” says Darron Patterson, a descendant of founder Pollee Allen. Patterson attended the training school in the 1960s before moving to Detroit to work as a sportswriter. “We had everything we needed right here,” he says. “This school taught us to be viable women and viable men. These folks had it going on.”His words echo throughout the day as representatives from five of the original families take the microphone and speak about their past, their present, and their hopes for the future.Home to some 12,000 people during its heyday in the 1960s, Africatown's population has fallen to less than 2,000. It once boasted several stores, gas stations, and barber shops. Now heavy industries surround the community, while many houses are unoccupied or in disrepair.Lorna Woods grew up in Green’s Alley behind the Union Baptist Church. The houses there were squeezed so close together, she recalls, “we could reach out the window and hand two slices of bread to the home next door.”Sometimes those gifts were sorely needed. If no smoke was rising from a neighbor’s chimney late in the afternoon, it meant they had no food for supper, Woods says. Soon enough they’d find a bag of groceries on the porch.Since those days the population of Africatown has plummeted—from about 12,000 in the 1960s to less than 2,000 today. Only half of the homes are occupied, and many abandoned dwellings are dilapidated or falling down. The Josephine Allen housing project in Happy Hills was home to hundreds of families in the 1970s. It closed years ago and sits empty and ransacked on a knoll overlooking the Mobile River.“I’m 70 years old,” Woods says, “and I still have in my heart a dream that our town will one day have stores and shops and gas stations again.”Joe Womack, a retired Marine Corps officer and environmental activist, formed Africatown-C.H.E.S.S. (Clean, Healthy, Educated, Safe, and Sustainable) to help clean up the community and serve as a watchdog for industrial pollution. “The city [of Mobile] hasn’t taken care of the community,” says Womack. “They want to industrialize the whole area.”Anderson Flen, a retired health care professional and long-time community activist, spent many hours fishing with his father in the waterways around Africatown. “It was a great place to grow up,” he says.It’s a dream many in the community share, but the City of Mobile seems to have another, more industrial vision. According to a recruiting brochure produced by Alabama Power and the Chamber of Commerce, Africatown is part of Alabama’s Chemical Corridor, a 50-mile stretch of river that’s home to 26 major chemical companies.Big industry began moving into the neighborhood in the 1920s, and during its boom years the area was home to three paper mills, a massive sawmill and lumber yard, and a tank farm with a dozen or so hulking oil and gasoline storage tanks. The four-lane Africatown-Cochran bridge, completed in 1991, was thrust through the heart of the business district, dividing the community and destroying local shops and stores.Located on Magazine Point in the middle of Africatown, the Kimberly-Clark paper mill (formerly Scott Paper) is one of three large paper mills that dominated the community for decades and the only one still in operation. "A lot of my family died from cancer," says Michael Ellis, 63, who worked at Scott Paper for 15 years. “I’m a cancer sufferer too.”The large industries provided good jobs, but they were a mixed blessing, says Michael Ellis, 63, who worked at Scott Paper for 15 years. His family had a big house on Bay Bridge Road, not far from one of the three paper mills that for decades released thousands of pounds of chloroform, a known carcinogen, into the air.“When I was a kid and all the paper mills were going, they were making a lot of people sick,” says Ellis, another descendant of Pollee Allen. “The smoke from those stacks would eat the paint off cars, so you know it wasn’t good for people. A lot of my family died from cancer.” Ellis himself is now fighting kidney cancer.The giant International Paper mill was located near the training school. It closed in 2000 and the company bulldozed the plant. Residents are now suing the company for failing to remove all the pollutants from the site.Joe Womack is one of several local activists who envision a cleaner, healthier future for the community, and who believes Africatown’s unique past can help revitalize its economy.“The city hasn’t taken care of the community because they want to industrialize the whole area,” Womack says. “They just want to make money, but they could make money with tourism. We just have to head them the right way.”A recent proposal to build 40 more tanks to store tar sand oil from Canada failed for a variety of reasons, including local opposition. The community has also been awarded $3.5 million from the BP Deepwater Horizon legal settlement to rebuild a visitor center destroyed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. There, tourists will learn the story of the last American slave ship and the resilient souls who founded Africatown.Descendants of Charlie Lewis gather for a family portrait in Africatown, not far from “Lewis Quarters,” where their family first put down roots as free Americans. More than 200 people from all over Mobile gathered to hear the descendants’ stories. “I never in a million years thought it would be that big,” says event organizer Joycelyn Davis, second from left. “It was amazing! We have to do it again next year.”Last year the Alabama Historical Commission partnered with the underwater archaeology firm Search, Inc., and the National Geographic Society to study a section of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta where the Clotilda is believed to have been burned and scuttled. Last summer marine archaeologists surveyed the area and located 18 objects of interest, including the remains of sunken ships. Analysis of their finds is ongoing, says James Delgado, leader of the Search team. (Related: "Expedition Hopes to Solve Mystery of Last American Slave Ship.")“People have been searching for Clotilda since 1860, and the only way to find it is through a careful and systematic survey,” Delgado says. “We promised everyone in the community that we’d leave no stone unturned, and that’s what we’re in the middle of doing.”",
"Archaeologists search a branch of the Mobile River for the sunken remains of the Clotilda, the last vessel to bring enslaved Africans to America.Mobile, AlabamaIt was one of the greatest unsolved crimes of the 19th century. Now a team of archaeologists is hunting for the smoking gun—the charred wreck of the Clotilda, the last slave ship to reach the United States before the outbreak of the Civil War.Experts from the National Geographic Society have joined marine archaeologists and divers from Search, Inc., and the Slave Wrecks Project of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in an intensive survey of a muddy branch of the Mobile River where the vessel is thought to lie.The Alabama Historical Commission (AHC) sponsored the expedition after a local reporter found what was thought to be the wreck earlier this year, focusing national attention on the vessel. Though it turned out to be another ship, it brought to the surface an important, if painful, era in the state's and nation's past.Towing sensing devices in their wake, researchers monitor laptops in hopes of detecting signs of sunken wreckage.“Many tourists like to come visit our plantation houses, but this is the true symbol of the horrors of slavery,” said Lisa Jones, executive director of AHC.The Clotilda, however, was no ordinary slaver, for the roots of its voyage extend to both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. The mastermind was Captain Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Mobile shipbuilder, riverboat captain, and plantation owner, who was born in Ireland and raised in Maine. Meaher allegedly wagered several Northern businessmen $1,000 that he could smuggle a cargo of Africans into Mobile Bay under the nose of federal officials—and act of piracy punishable by death that had been banned in the U.S. since 1805.A mural of the Clotilda adorns a concrete embankment in Africatown, a neighborhood in Mobile where Clotilda captives settled after the Civil War.Undeterred, Meaher hired Captain William Foster, a native of Nova Scotia, to take his fast, new schooner to the infamous slave port of Whydah in present-day Benin to purchase a cargo of captives for $9,000 in gold. He returned in July 1860 with 110 humans on board, snuck them up the braided Mobile River under cover of night, and offloaded them onto a riverboat.The captives were taken farther upstream and hidden deep in the swamps until they could be transferred to plantations owned by Meaher, his two brothers, and their associates. Foster then burned his ship to the waterline to hide the evidence of his crime.The widely reported story made Meaher and Foster heroes throughout the South. They were indicted by the local U.S. attorney but never convicted. The charges became moot six months later after Alabama seceded from the Union.A bust of Cudjo Kazoola Lewis, the last survivor of the original group on the Clotilda slave ship, stands in front of the Union Missionary Baptist Church.It was the Clotilda's passengers, however, who made the ship unique. After the Civil War, the West African captives who had remained on local plantations reunited and settled on a wild bank of the river known as Plateau, just north of Mobile. There they elected a chief, built simple homes, and resurrected many of their African customs. Though they eventually intermarried with other freed slaves, the tightly knit, fiercely independent community became known as Africatown.Descendants of those original Africans brought over on the Clotilda still live in Africatown today, providing an unbroken genealogical record for their families unavailable to most African-Americans. Despite their obvious presence, their story was repeatedly denied by Meaher, Foster, and others in Mobile, blurring the lines between fact and fiction.Lorna Woods poses for a portrait in the historic district of Africatown. Mrs. Woods is a 5th generation descendant of her great-great grandfather Charles Lewis, who was aboard the Clotilda and a founding member of Africatown.“The stories about Clotilda were always taught in our home,” said Lorna Woods, a local historian and descendant of Charlie Lewis, one of the West Africans who settled in the community. “People just didn't talk to folks in this neighborhood. Mr. Meaher was a powerful man and he didn't want the story to get out. But this is a major part of our history, as important as the Amistad or the Titanic.”The team of archaeologists—led by James Delgado, former head of maritime archaeology for the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—is using high-resolution sonar and other sensing devices to search a muddy, two-mile stretch of the Mobile River for remains of the burned vessel.“I get goosebumps when I think we may provide conclusive evidence for this missing piece of American history,” said National Geographic archaeologist Fred Heibert. “One of the most important things that archaeology can provide is closure to stories that have no conclusion.”A crabber works his lines beneath the giant span of the Cochrane-Africatown Bridge. Built in 1991, the bridge's landing split the community in two, one of many industrial impacts on the close-knit neighborhood.",
"The National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is the largest cultural destination devoted to the African-American experience.In 1860, the schooner Clotilda—the last slave ship to bring African captives to the American South—arrived at the Alabama coast, its hold containing 110 people smuggled into the U.S. more than 50 years after importing slaves was outlawed. After an intensive yearlong search, supported by the National Geographic Society, marine archaeologists have located the Clotilda. Few slave vessels have ever been found, so this groundbreaking discovery unlocks a mystery that many thought lost to history. (Read more about finding Clotilda.)Such breakthroughs help preserve our shared heritage and tell the stories of the estimated 389,000 Africans delivered into bondage in mainland America from the early 1600s to 1860. For some descendants of slaves, artifacts such as the Clotilda represent a tangible connection to their ancestors. For travelers, such discoveries can present an opportunity to learn more about U.S. history.“The African-American experience is the lens through which we understand what it is to be an American,” writes Lonnie G. Bunch III, the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The national collection in Washington, D.C., is just one of many diverse museums and monuments across the country that help visitors connect to significant moments in black history and to learn about the country’s legacy of racial injustice. Here are 13 destinations for discovering more about African-American history and culture.Despite initial funds provided in 1915 by black Civil War veterans and a signed Public Resolution from President Calvin Coolidge in 1929 establishing a commission to plan its construction, it wasn’t until legislation signed by then President George W. Bush in 2003 that the museum had the authorization it needed to be created on the National Mall. Since the museum opened in fall 2016, visitors will be able to explore more than 400 years of artifacts and historical information detailing the African American experience. (Read more about the museum.)Established in 1965, this Detroit museum holds the world’s largest permanent collection of African-American culture. Among the more than 35,000 artifacts, find interactive kids stations, displays on trailblazers in science and engineering, and stained-glass windows by Samuel A. Hodge that depict stories of notable African Americans from dancers to civil rights activists. The annual three-day African World Festival held in August celebrates the cultures of the diaspora with hosts free performances by gospel legends such as the Clark Sisters, African drummers, and dance troupes.The Tuskegee Airmen of World War II, the first squadron of back military airmen, weren’t considered equals in the eyes of the law but that didn't stop them from defending the country. The museum details their training and the role they played in desegregating the military. Also find monuments to the men who served as “Red Tails” all over the country, including a National Park Service site in Tuskegee, Alabama, in their honor.Informally called the lynching memorial, the first U.S. commemoration of the thousands of men, women, and children who were murdered—primarily because of the color of their skin—opened in Montgomery in April 2018. This Alabama site holds 805 hanging, steel rectangles in the shape of coffins, each representing one of the U.S. counties where a documented lynching took place, as reported by legal advocacy nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative. Steps away, visitors may explore the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration, which opened on the same day and displays the history of racism in America—beginning with slavery before examining lynching, the Civil Rights era, and the present. (Discover the new U.S. Civil Rights Trail in Alabama.)A slave cabin from a South Carolina plantation sits among the exhibits at the NMAAHC. At the Whitney Plantation, visitors can walk the fields once toiled in by slaves and learn the history of this brutal time in American history. Informed docents provide tours through memorials, slave cabins, and the great house with a unique focus on the slaves’ perspective. (Plantations are a dark chapter in American history—here’s why to visit.)There is no shortage of museums dedicated to civil rights in America set in spots where pivotal points in the movement's history occurred. The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis is built across from the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated as he stood on a balcony in 1968. Visitors can hear audio of oral history recounting firsthand accounts of life under Jim Crow or women of Montgomery boycotting bus segregation.African American men who worked as porters on the trains of the Pullman Car Company are revered for their service and dedication. The men endured incredibly long working hours for about $60 per month and more than half of that went back to the company to pay for the supplies they used on the job. Stories of their experience on the segregated trains, and off, are detailed in the intriguing museum, which also explains the political climate of the time and rise of unions like the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.The Buffalo Soldiers were a group of former slaves, freemen, and black Civil War soldiers who continued to serve America during peacetime. So named by the Native Americans, the soldiers often are lauded for helping to forge the Wild West. The museum showcases the efforts of African Americans in the protection of this country, at home and abroad, where often their safety was equally at risk due to the color of their skin.The intricate, secret network of allies that runaway slaves relied on to escape to freedom was called the Underground Railroad. Although slavery ended in the United States roughly 150 years ago, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center works to keep the story and the message alive for the current generation. With exhibitions that highlight slave trades of the past and present, the center presents interactive exhibits, films, and even includes a slave pen from Kentucky built in the early 1800s. The moving tribute is even more relevant given the approximately 27 million people estimated to be enslaved around the world today. (What if Martin Luther King Jr. were never assassinated?)Although Americans of all races are lauded here, the inclusion of the relationship of Memphis Soul to the 1930s sharecropper roots and the city’s civil rights movement history lend a poignant backdrop. The museum's artifacts and exhibits were curated by the Smithsonian Institute and offer opportunities to hear the music, read the stories, and watch films from decades past.Long before Jackie Robinson became a household name, African American baseball players were making a name for themselves on the field. The Negro League offered these men a place to play in a segregated America. The museum highlights the successes and struggles of the players (both superstars and the unknown) and provides a glimpse into the incredible talent kept out of the mainstream. The museum is located in the historic 18th and Vine district with the American Jazz Museum, also worthy of a look for those in town.What started as an ode to black cowboys has grown to include tales and artifacts of African Americans who made their way west to forge new lives, whether driven by professional or personal circumstances. Located in the former home of Colorado’s first female African American physician, Justina Ford, the museum is packed with photos and artifacts is best experienced with a pre-arranged tour.This 44,000-square-foot museum does a great job of showcasing items from African American history while also heralding contemporary themes. The exhibition “Oh Snap! West Coast Hip Hop Photography” is just one example of how the museum makes the collection interesting, informative, and accessible to younger audiences.",
"Lonnie Bunch, 65, has been an author, an educator, and a historian. Each vocation shaped him for the job he has today: founding director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Bunch recently was interviewed by National Geographic Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg.Susan Goldberg: The museum has been an overwhelming success; visitors have to order tickets months in advance. To what do you attribute that passionate interest?Lonnie Bunch: I think part of it is that so many people really wanted to understand the full history of the United States. A lot of people find this a pilgrimage. The most amazing thing is to watch grandparents talk to grandchildren about an event they lived through or to see people cross racial lines to find common ground over things that once divided us. It really has become a place whose time is now and whose story is so important to all of us. The human scale allows people to feel that they can talk about issues. Suddenly they’re thinking, That could be me. That could be my grandmother. You have an engagement you don’t normally have.SG: The discussions about race in the United States right now have taken on a hard edge, a pointed edge. Do you think that this museum is helpful in allowing people to have a place to talk?LB: We are in a divided America, where race and issues of white supremacy are at the forefront of our conversations. I think the museum is a place that helps us explore things that are difficult, helps us explore where race matters and how it’s divided us. I also think people come because they believe that by looking at the history of America through an African-American lens, they’re finding moments of optimism, moments to believe that no matter how bad things are, you can effect change if you’re willing to struggle and to demand America live up to its stated ideals.SG: April is the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. If Dr. King could come back, what would he think about things now?LB: Dr. King would feel that there has been great progress. We had an African-American president. You have people like me running museums.But I think he also would be saddened by the fact that we’ve not found what he called “the beloved community.” We’ve not found the community where there is economic justice. We’ve not found the community where race matters, but matters less.I think he would be impressed by the growth of a black middle class and also the growth in the number of African Americans going through college and being educated. He’d be pleased to see that there are better notions of integration in certain areas.I think he’d be disappointed in that we’re still so segregated in our schools, that the cities are places where often the American dream doesn’t exist for many people. He would be really pleased, but also perplexed at why, 50 years later, these issues still divide us. I think he would be encouraging us to protest, to push, to demand. I think he would demand that we continue to make America better by challenging it.SG: Do you think he’d be proud of what he’d find on many of the streets, in the United States and around the world, that now bear his name?LB: He would’ve hoped that his street would’ve run through neighborhoods where people were reaping the best of America. He would be proud that his name would inspire people to be better. I think he would be really impressed that his dream still lives.",
"A composite image of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The left shows marchers starting the second Selma-to-Montgomery march in 1965, while the right shows the bridge in 2014."The lemonade ain’t ready yet, sweetie,” the cashier says. “We got sweet tea, though.”It’s 11 a.m. at Eagle’s restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama. I can see women in the kitchen squeezing the juice out of bright yellow lemons into a giant plastic vat. This wasn’t going to be some Country Time powdered mix. It was going to be fresh.A soul food joint just off I-65 in the northern part of the city, Eagle’s has been Black-owned and family-operated since it opened its doors in 1951, 40 years before I was born. On the walls are faded pictures of the athletes and politicians who’ve dined here. It’s early for this buffet of oxtails, black-eyed peas, mac and cheese, collard greens, candied yams, and spaghetti in tomato sauce. But since my dad and I have only just begun our Alabama road trip, the novelty of having soul food for every meal is overpowering. I order the sweet tea. [Read about the food of the American Civil Rights movement.]A bust of Martin Luther King, Jr., keeps the dream alive at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, in Selma. The church was the starting point for the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights marches in 1965.My father sits at one of the restaurant’s six vinyl booths, eyeglasses lifted onto his forehead, squinting down at a Google map on his iPhone that traces our path from Birmingham to Selma to Montgomery. I’ve never been to the Deep South before, but I’m here now to visit historic sites along the recently inaugurated U.S. Civil Rights Trail, a conceptual pathway that links 130 museums, churches, courthouses, and other places that have contributed to the advancement of social equality in this country.The trail includes Topeka, Kansas—the site of the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case—and Memphis, Tennessee, where, just a few weeks prior to my trip, thousands of people flocked to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, death and to mark the opening of the new National Civil Rights Museum in the Lorraine Motel where King was assassinated.Nearly a quarter of the trail’s sites are in Alabama, a place many consider ground zero for the civil rights movement. The trail covers the attacks on Freedom Riders, the Selma-to-Montgomery Voting Rights March, and the Montgomery street corner where Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. Birmingham itself was nicknamed “Bombingham” in the 1950s for the sticks of dynamite set off by racists at the homes of Black activists and at public gathering spaces, including the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four young girls lost their lives.The Southern Poverty Law Center Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, was designed by Maya Lin and features a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech.I break a piece of cornbread and watch steam rise from the middle. My family has roots below the Mason-Dixon line, but I’m a die-hard Brooklyn girl who spent my adolescent years pretending to be from the Caribbean, because that’s where most of the Black kids in my elementary school were from. They’d always tease me that, as a Black American, I had “no culture.” And for a while, I believed them. It had me questioning early on what it meant to be not just Black in America, but to be Black and American.I think about that now, sitting here in Eagle’s, eating food prepared by women who remind me of women in my own family. This food is so clearly of a culture, with a specific way to be enjoyed. I know to bow my head and thank the hands that prepared it before I eat it; I know to put hot sauce on the mac and cheese, a little vinegar on the greens; I know that when I’m done, I’ll probably need a nap. It’s this knowledge that makes the South seem like home to me, despite my geographical distance from the region. I sensed it immediately at Eagle’s, an unspoken message: “I see you, respect you, affirm you.”I’m road tripping with my dad to see if this kind of deep-seated connectedness is something I’ll find throughout Alabama. And I’m on a quest to bridge what I have learned about Black history and culture with what I can feel of it in a place steeped in the foods, religion, and rich traditions of my people.On our way out of Eagle’s, the cashier rushes over with a cup of lemonade. “It’s on the house, sweetie,” she says. I smile. I’ve just gotten my first taste of Southern hospitality.In Birmingham, we stay at the 14-story Redmont, Alabama’s oldest operating hotel. It’s all about vaulted ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and doormen who still wear pillbox hats and jackets. Typically I’d find this charming. But now the period details are a reminder that back when the Redmont was built, in 1925, my father and I wouldn’t have been able to get a room. Instead, we would have been directed to the Gaston Motel, one of the numerous businesses owned by A.G. Gaston, an Alabama native who, by 1960, was considered the “richest Black man in America.”Bombed once, the Gaston was a meeting point for civil rights marchers. Room 30, where King stayed, was notably dubbed the “war room.” Situated near Fourth Avenue, the motel anchored this historic Black business sector, which saw its height during the civil rights era but traces its roots to the early 1900s. At that time, locals and those passing through could find places to rest and eat, and maybe get a haircut or shoe shine. There are plans to rehabilitate the long-shuttered motel as an annex to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. [Consider what if Martin Luther King Jr. were never assassinated.]Little remains of Fourth Avenue’s vitality. At Green Acres Cafe, one of the last remaining Black-owned businesses from the civil rights era, we order fish sandwiches—whiting fried hard, doused in hot sauce and ketchup, between two slices of white bread, just the way I’d had them growing up. We sit on a bench outside to eat. I imagine a Fourth Avenue as it once was: Black folks shopping, dining, being enterprising, being. I am struck by the power in this conjured scene.Saw’s Soul Kitchen, in Birmingham's Avondale area, is famous for its BBQ pork and collard greens.“You know Black people invented bed-and-breakfasts, right?” my father says as we drive to Selma, less than two hours south of Birmingham.I tilt my head to the side, “For real?”.“Well, not exactly. It’s just my theory, because we could never stay nowhere. That’s what the Green Book was for, so we’d know exactly where to go and not to go.”The Negro Motorist Green Book was an annual guide for African-American road-trippers. Published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green, the book was made up of personal testimonials from one Black traveler to another. Readers could flip through pages of recommended establishments to discover where they could have a warm meal—not just the fried chicken they’d stashed in a shoe box in case the next eatery serving Black folks was miles away—or where they could use a real bathroom, instead of going by the side of the road, or in a “pee can.” Rest stops were a no-go, as were certain cities after dark. Those were called Sundown Towns, and the Green Book advised Black travelers to drive on.My father and I have spent lots of time together in cars, driving up and down highways and parkways in the northeast, shuttling groceries and antique furniture to and from the five bed-and-breakfasts my family operates. The only fight we ever get into is over the radio: I always want a hip hop station, he insists on NPR. While we haven’t felt particularly unsafe on the road in Alabama, my father does make a point of putting on his U.S. Navy Veteran hat before we go out each day. [Discover more than 1,000 streets honoring Martin Luther King Jr. around the world.]Only six in 1964, when Jim Crow laws ended in the South, my father experienced the civil rights movement mainly by watching Dr. King give speeches on TV. During the annual road trips he and his family took to South Carolina to visit relatives, he would see signs declaring “You Are Now Entering Klan Territory,” and he’d be filled with a fear he didn’t understand because, on the East Coast Army bases where he grew up, pecking order was based more on military rank than race. “Everyone was cool with everyone, especially the kids,” he said. “Black, white, it didn’t matter.”Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church served as a community hub for civil rights activists. On September 15, 1963, a bombing here killed four young girls. A stained-glass window memorializes the event at the still active church.As we approach Selma, a small town of around 18,000 people, I shoot a text to Thelma Dianne Harris, a 69-year-old Selma native and former student activist in the Voting Rights March. Ms. Harris now offers tours of Selma’s civil rights landmarks; I found her on Facebook, and we’ve been talking over the phone for a few weeks. She had helped me track down a Black-owned homestay in town.I meet her on the steps of Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, the starting point for the Selma-to-Montgomery marches. She’s a petite woman with a soft voice and warm smile. Her hair, makeup, and clothes are styled in a careful way that reminds me of every older woman in my family. We hug like best friends.“Welcome to Selma,” she says, proudly.Throughout our journey, my father keeps saying that the places we’re visiting are on “hallowed ground.” It becomes his mantra. Inside Brown Chapel, we take seats in a wooden pew near the front. The wood is worn down to a softness that makes me think about the bodies that once filled these same seats. What were they feeling when they sat here? Joy? Anger? Mourning? Righteousness? All were possible in the civil rights era, when the church wasn’t just a place to go for Sunday service but a safe space to organize demonstrations and share resources. It’s why churches were, and are, targets of hate groups determined to thwart progress and spread fear.Later that afternoon, Ms. Harris brings us to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. “I remember the day so well,” she says. “I was 15.” She’s referring to March 7, 1965, or “Bloody Sunday.” That day, some 600 demonstrators attempted to cross the Pettus Bridge on a march from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights.The demonstrators’ plan was to march to the capitol building in Montgomery and bring their case directly to Alabama Governor George Wallace. When they got to the bridge, which sits at the edge of Selma’s city limits, “there was a mob, and they started attacking marchers at the front, beating them with bats and pipes. There was tear gas in the air,” she tells us.Ms. Harris was marching with her brother and they started running, trailed by a policeman on horseback. “All I kept telling myself was ‘just get back to the church, just get back to the church.’” Fourteen days later, on March 21, demonstrators successfully crossed the bridge, arriving in Montgomery on March 25. Ms. Harris was among the 25,000 demonstrators in Montgomery that day.As a young girl, I knew the civil rights movement as names, places, and dates I needed to memorize to pass quizzes during Black History Month. But listening to Ms. Harris’s stories, this distant history seems suddenly tangible.A statue depicts a slave family in chains at the Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama.The next morning, we wake up in the home Ms. Harris helped us find. It’s a shotgun-style house with a coziness that feels like families have made memories here. Of all the places we would stay in Alabama, this will be our favorite. Although our host, Mark, isn’t physically there, his presence is everywhere. There are little notes on the fridge and cabinets that encourage us to help ourselves to snacks. When we check out, I’ll foolishly leave my ID behind, and Mark will priority-mail it to my Brooklyn apartment. When I email him to say thank you, he replies with a nod to the world of Black Panther, “That’s what we do in Wakanda. We look out for each other.”I read online that the Old Live Oak Cemetery, not too far away, is dripping in Spanish moss and I decide we have to check it out.Driving up the gravel entrance to the cemetery, we see a lot of moss—as well as Confederate flags neatly dotting every grave in sight. When the wind blows, they flap in a flurry of red. They seem to me like flags of a foreign country.We discover a headstone for Edmund Pettus, for whom the bridge was named. The stone indicates that he was a general in the Confederacy; above the inscription is an iron Ku Klux Klan cross. Pettus was a Grand Dragon of the KKK.As we walk further into the cemetery, we run into a towering statue of a Confederate soldier, north-facing cannons, and a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and the first leader of the Ku Klux Klan. We are standing at Confederate Circle, a commemorative plot commissioned in 1877.Are these flags and statues reminders of an ugly racist past, or are they emblems of a history we should never forget? I have trouble divorcing the heritage from the hate. Student groups in Selma have rallied to remove the Forrest statue, but the land has long been managed by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group that says it “totally denounces any individual or group that promotes racial divisiveness or white supremacy,” and only wants to “honor the memory” of their ancestors. As my father and I pull out of Live Oak, a woman sitting idly in a car near the monument smiles and waves at us. I notice the UDC logo is printed on her car’s fuel door.Michelle Browder, a civil rights tour operator in Birmingham, has an office at the renovated Kress Building. During the 1960s, lunch counters at S.H. Kress five-and-dime stores throughout the South were sites of sit-ins protesting segregation.The last city on our Southern road trip is Montgomery, where we arrange a tour with Michelle Browder, a painter and activist who was raised in Alabama, and who founded I Am More Than..., a non-profit organization that helps young people gain entrepreneurial skills and training as tour guides. Browder is a boisterous Black woman with big hair and a bright red pair of cat-eye glasses. She’s sharp, candid, and seemingly knows everyone in Montgomery. We climb into her golf cart, which sports a decal of her signature glasses. She takes us to the Court Square-Dexter Avenue Historic District and explains that it’s a hotbed of history—the Winter Building, which sits on the circle, is where the telegram calling for the strike on Fort Sumter, which triggered the Civil War, was transmitted. Rosa Parks was arrested on the opposite corner and, most jarring for me, the entire circle was once where Black bodies were auctioned off during the slave trade.Browder swings her cart up Dexter Avenue near the Alabama State Capitol grounds to cut across town. As she does, we notice at least 25 men standing on the Capitol lawn. Long-haired and dressed in leather, they each carry large Confederate and Alabama state flags. A man declares through a bullhorn that his “right to carry guns shouldn’t be hindered by liberals.”Then we look to our right and see a party of people dressed in traditional Civil War-era clothing filling the lawn of the First White House of the Confederacy, which served as the executive residence of President Jefferson Davis when Montgomery was the capital of the Confederate States of America. It’s at least 85 degrees outside, and men are in three-piece suits and top hats. Women wear big hoop skirts and intricate lace blouses. The scene is surreal. Sandwiched by both gatherings, I feel torn between past and present.Browder turns to us. “I’m embarrassed,” she says. All afternoon she’d been showing us around her city, telling us how far they had come: the newly renovated retail and community space in the once segregated Kress department store, the work Bryan Stevenson is doing at the Equal Justice Initiative, headquartered in downtown Montgomery. Real progress, often complicated.“I think I know what will make us feel better,” Browder says, restarting her cart. We putter wordlessly across a few avenues and stop at the Malden Brothers Barber Shop, where Martin Luther King, Jr., regularly had his haircut. The space is quiet, save for the hum of the clippers. The wood-paneled walls are cluttered with pictures of King and the many other notable individuals who’ve had their hair cut here. There are posters from President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign beside a vintage “Colored Waiting Room” sign.“How y’all doing this afternoon?” the barber asks us, dusting away stray hairs from the neck of his client with a soft brush. The familiarity of the place eases the disquiet of moments before. I’m not sure how to answer, so I nod and say “Doing alright.”My road trip has been a seesaw of the familiar and the strange. The Civil Rights Trail is a powerful testimony to the legacy of my people’s perseverance. It says to those who fought, and continue to fight, injustice: I see you. I respect you. I affirm you. But if this journey has taught me anything, other than that I really like hush puppies and sweet tea, it’s that in America it’s possible to feel wholly at home and yet strangely removed at the same time.As my father and I head back north, I remember something a woman I met at Selma’s Brown Chapel said, lamenting the decline in church membership. “A lot of young people have moved to bigger cities for work, or they just aren’t interested in coming,” she said. “We wish they knew this was a place for them. Perhaps things would be better if they did.”In her words I hear a message that extends beyond the church and beyond Alabama. The message is partly an open invitation: When you journey into the past, you gain a glimpse into the future. Make it better.",
"The Whitney Plantation is located on the west bank of the Mississippi on Louisiana’s historic River Road.The moment I see her name, I feel a lump in my throat.“Pauline Johnson” is written on the back of the small card hanging from a lanyard around my neck. It tells me she was a 12-year-old child who had watched her father die in Louisiana just before slavery was abolished in the United States.Everyone who visits the Whitney Plantation, located on the west bank of the Mississippi less than an hour’s drive from New Orleans on Louisiana’s historic River Road, receives a similar card. Each bears the story of a different slave, derived from interviews with more than 2,300 former slaves conducted by the Federal Writers’ Project in the 1930s.I am standing next to my own 12-year-old the moment I read Pauline’s story and can’t imagine him having to grow up knowing he was someone else’s property.The inability to imagine is part of the luxury of this tour.Visitors have the opportunity—the privilege—of learning about the complex and often grueling history of slavery in the United States from a distance of more than 150 years. The 13th Amendment to the nation’s constitution, which outlawed the practice unequivocally, was ratified in December 1865.Despite the fact that the Whitney Plantation, a sugar-cane plantation formerly home to more than 350 African slaves, is immaculately groomed, the raw emotion of the place is undeniable.Travel across sections of the American South and you’ll be hard-pressed to avoid running across one of the large antebellum plantations—some as populous as modern-day suburban housing developments—that once dominated the countryside.Plantation tours are almost equally ubiquitous. At most properties, the visitor experience includes a guided exploration of the plantation home and grounds led by a living historian clad in period garb.It typically goes a bit like this: Tour the big house with a docent portraying a privileged occupant, then follow one meant to be a black slave or cook through the fields and kitchens.A retired (white) trial lawyer named John Cummings took it upon himself to tell the plantation story in a different way.In 2014, at the age of 77, the New Orleans native opened the doors on a project 15 years in the making. The Whitney Plantation Museum is one of the only historic sites in the country focused solely on the slave experience.From the outset, our guide Courtney makes it clear to the group, which includes a mixed bag of ages and races, that the goal here is to inform and educate, not to shame or romanticize. Notably, she isn’t wearing a costume.Contrary to precedent, the tour doesn’t commence in the massive plantation home, where the land (and slave-) owners would have lived. This experience is not about them, Courtney tells us.Instead we start in the tiny freed-slave-built Antioch Baptist Church, a cool spot to escape the searing heat of a Louisiana summer’s day, to be sure, but also the kind of place where slaves would have found sanctuary and a few moments of rest and peace.The church isn’t original to the property; it was donated to the plantation in 2001 by a congregation in Paulina, a community located just a few miles away on the opposite side of the Mississippi River.This kind of deliberate borrowing is part and parcel of the Whitney Plantation Museum experiment, which seeks to provide a unique perspective on the working plantation as it evolved over time in Louisiana in addition to paying homage to the experiences of slaves across the American South.Many of the outbuildings that now sit on the living history museum’s grounds, including most of the slave cabins—small shacks that would have been shared by up to a dozen workers—have been imported from nearby plantations to help tell that story.Though some acquisitions have been donated, Cummings has personally invested millions here. Art he has commissioned includes 40 life-size casts of slave children that stand and sit in and among the pews of the church, and a massive bronze angel erected in the garden to memorialize the 2,200 children who died on the plantation and across St. John the Baptist Parish before slavery was abolished in the United States.A young man comforts his friend after taking a tour at the new African American Museum of History and Culture in Washington, D.C., during the opening weekend of the museum.As we walk through the fields where slaves once collected sugar cane, we come upon Allées Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, an open-air monument honoring the 107,000 people who were held in bondage in Louisiana.The group is left to read plaque after plaque in silence before Courtney shares more information.We learn about Louisiana’s Code Noir, a list of state-proposed recommendations—regarding housing, clothing, food, and more—put forth in order to make the slave trade more “humane.” The terms of the code suggest slaves should be given a day off each week (it rarely happened, we are told), guaranteed food (insufficient weekly rations drove many slaves to hunt squirrel, possum, and alligator), and treated with care (abuse was rampant), exposing the shocking gap between prescribed behavior and reality.We see the tiny outdoor kitchen (the oldest in Louisiana) where the enslaved cook would have prepared meals for the master’s family and the “hot box”—a rusting metal chamber barely wide enough to stand in with arms outstretched where slaves awaiting sale at auction or those being punished would be left to suffer in the hot sun. On the interior walls, Courtney points out small cutouts meant to hold a slave’s chains. Nearby, a list of slaves and the prices for which their lives were bought and sold is posted.And on it goes.By the time we get to the 14-room plantation house, it seems to have grown in size. Courtney shows us the fine china, elaborate drawing rooms, and frescoed ceiling without emotion. Still, I feel my stomach turn. The view of the cabins in the distance only makes it worse.In addition to the escorted tour, the plantation offers a small self-guided area where visitors can learn about the history of slavery on an international scale, offering vital perspective on an industry that once fueled much of the world’s economy.It is there that we learn most slaves came from West Central Africa, that Portugal and Brazil were among the largest slave traders, and that 2,500,000 slaves eventually were brought to North America. We are also introduced to the pope, Nicholas V, who authorized the King of Portugal to “capture and subjugate” people who weren’t Christians for the purpose of forced labor “in perpetuity,” a harsh reminder of how morally upright the practice was felt to be.Courtney is careful with specifics of brutality owing to the children on the tour. My own two boys remain interested but detached as we make our way around the property. They take in the information presented, sometimes offering their thoughts (“That’s not right.”), and move along. But the tour dominates our conversation as we drive away from the plantation, grateful for the chance to talk about the experience in private.Much like a trip to Auschwitz-Birkenau, there is no joy in visiting the Whitney Plantation, or in learning about the atrocities that happened there and on similar properties throughout the South. You won’t leave feeling better about humanity, especially in light of recent racial tensions across the United States. But you will leave informed … and affected.",
"At Charleston landmarks such as McLeod Plantation and the Aiken-Rhett House, visitors learn how cotton and rice powered South Carolina’s economy in the 17th and 18th centuries. It’s less known that indigo was also such a vital crop for the British colony that planters called it “blue gold.” The leggy, subtropical bush produced an enchanting blue dye that was sent back to England to produce household items, military uniforms, and even Union Jack flags.Though indigo disappeared in the American South after the Revolutionary War, it’s now making a comeback in and around Charleston. Travelers can take artisan-led workshops on how to harvest and dye with the plant, and most of all, visit historic sites which explore the ugly past of this beautiful color.Revered by ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans for its association with power, authority, and the sacred, indigo belongs to the pea family. The British attempted to grow it as early as 1607 in Jamestown, their first colony in Virginia.(How Charleston is telling stories about enslaved Africans in a new way.)But it wasn’t until 16-year-old Eliza Lucas (Pinckney) came along that the crop took off. In the 1730s, Eliza’s father, a lieutenant governor stationed in Antigua, put her in charge of the family’s three plantations (and 60 enslaved people) outside of Charleston. Skilled in botany, she had her father ship her some indigo seeds.“There was absolutely no one in the Carolina colonies that knew anything about indigo plants,” says Andrew Rodrigues, a historian at the Gullah Museum in Georgetown, South Carolina. “Her father sent an expert [African] dye maker from one of the French islands, and he taught Eliza and the [enslaved people] how to process indigo.”Indigo soon became South Carolina’s second best cash crop. “Along with rice, it made South Carolina the wealthiest of the 13 colonies,” Rodrigues says. At one point in the 1700s, more than a million pounds of it a year were harvested, processed, and packed into cakes to be shipped back to Britain, a $40 million value today.Enslaved laborers made the indigo bonanza possible. They were forced to work in giant brick vats where the fermenting smell and stagnant water attracted flies and mosquitoes, and with them, the constant threat of cholera, yellow fever, and malaria. It took some 180 pounds of leaves to produce one pound of indigo dye.“There’s a reason why enslaved labor was used,” says Jeff Neale, director of preservation and interpretation at Middleton Place, a circa-1675 Charleston-area plantation where rice and indigo once thrived. “No one else would do it; conditions were horrible.”After American independence in 1776, Britain took its indigo business to India and U.S. farmers stopped growing the plant. Most denim makers and other manufacturers turned to chemical dyes.Then, about a decade ago, natural indigo started resurging. Books including The Indigo Girl by Natasha Boyd, a novel about Eliza Lucas, spurred interest in its history. Textile artists, moving away from polluting petroleum-based dyes, rediscovered the ancient plants.Despite the crop’s ubiquity in colonial times, the Otranto Plantation Indigo Vat, in Berkeley County, South Carolina, is one of the only tangible sites left behind. A historical marker spotlights two 14-by-14-foot brick basins where indigo would have been processed. “During its heyday, the dye was brewed in vats as large as swimming pools,” Neale says.Today, Middleton Place grows indigo again, and museum employees give demonstrations on dyeing and explain the brutal labor required to dig reservoirs for water, plant, harvest, and process the indigo.(Find out why Charleston is on our 2023 Best of the World list.)The Gullah Geechee people, descendants of enslaved Africans forced to work plantations in coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, still live on the islands and Lowcountry along the southeastern United States coast. Today, the Gullah Museum in Georgetown explores the region’s history.Other traces of indigo appear in unexpected places through South Carolina’s Lowcountry. Many homes are accented with sky blue paint, often called “haint blue.” Enslaved people started the custom, covering their doors, shutters, and entryways with a potion made of indigo, dirt, lime, and milk. It was meant to ward off evil spirits, or “haints.” Today, the shade remains popular on Southern porch ceilings.Travelers can try indigo crafts themselves at workshops and retreats run by artisans in and around Charleston.Caroline and David Harper started CHI Design Indigo in Charleston about nine years ago, focusing on eco-conscious fashion as well as historic preservation. Before starting her business, Caroline had attended an indigo workshop in Japan, only to realize the plant was native to the Carolinas. The Harpers now hold indigo classes and retreats throughout the year.Leanne Coulter and Rhonda Davis run Daufuskie Blues studio out of a 1930s schoolhouse on remote Daufuskie Island, South Carolina, accessible only by ferry from Hilton Head. “I was shocked to learn indigo was here in our backyard, growing wild,” Davis says. “It’s leftover from the days of indigo plantations.” And textile artist Leigh “Madame Magar” Magar offers one- to three-day workshops on her property on Johns Island near Charleston, which once held an indigo plantation.At the workshops, students learn the basics of dyeing, folding pieces of fabric and cinching them with string, then dipping them into vats of blueberry-hued indigo. The cloth comes out looking greenish before exposure to the air turns it a rich blue.Indigo isn’t restricted to the South. Kenya Miles first discovered it while living in California. “A friend from El Salvador said people there were using indigo, and we were trying to do sustainable work,” she says. Miles learned how to work with it, and now lives in Baltimore, Maryland, where she runs Blue Light Junction, a studio with a color lab and dye garden. “People are hungry for indigo,” she says.",
"None of the exhibits at the Old Slave Mart Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, will tell you that the fingerprints pressed into the building’s bricks are those of enslaved people. No poster explains that prior to the Civil War, enslaved African and African-descended people at nearby plantations made the material by hand: harvesting clay out of rivers, packing it into molds, continuously feeding the fire for the kiln.When Ista Clarke was hired as the museum’s operations manager, he noticed the tiny fingerprints in a brick three months into the job—most likely from an enslaved child tasked with turning bricks over by hand as they dried. He began to curate dozens of photos of the bricks from across South Carolina and Georgia, calling the marks “an impression easily missed.”The museum, located inside the concrete shell of the last standing slave auction hall in South Carolina, summons a painful scene from that era with a soundtrack of clinking chains and bartering salesmen. Three silhouettes—labeled trader, slave, and buyer—cover one wall. Placards detail a day in the life of a slave trader. The museum, like many other sites in Charleston, is still figuring out how to tell local Black history after centuries of suppression.Between the early days of the Carolina colony in 1670 and the 1808 federal ban on “importation of persons,” about 40 percent of enslaved Africans forced into North America passed through Charleston’s harbor. Slavers confined those who survived the passage to various warehouses and slave markets until selling them to the highest bidder. Historians estimate that more than 90 percent of all African Americans can trace at least one ancestor to this area.June 23 marks one year since the city council voted to remove the statue of prominent Southern politician and defender of slavery John C. Calhoun—citing the police killing of George Floyd and “the voices of protest” that followed as catalysts. It‘s also three years since the city apologized for its role in the slave trade. After 20 years of planning, the International African American Museum is scheduled to open next year on the plot of the former Gadsden’s Wharf—a feat that South Carolina Democratic representative and museum board member James E. Clyburn has called “long overdue.”(As monuments fall, how does the world reckon with a racist past?)Yet, the city’s path to preserving and presenting Black history has been a contentious one, filled with starkly different narratives about its role in making America. “It’s about the ancestors,” says Clarke. “It’s always been about the ancestors. But unfortunately, the city doesn’t know that.”When the original Old Slave Mart Museum opened in 1938, it was the first, and for many decades the only, museum dedicated to the slave trade in the United States.The museum’s founder, a white Ohioan named Miriam B. Wilson, filled the gallery with crafts like hand-sewn sheets and ironworks made by enslaved people. Even though the mart was a commercial epicenter for the buying and selling of human beings, the museum’s exhibits reflected Wilson’s belief that the brutality of slavery had been overstated, and that it was primarily a civilizing institution.(Take a virtual tour of South Carolina’s only civil rights museum.)Those kinds of views were not uncommon in Charleston at the time, and they permeated through the budding movement to protect its colonial-era architecture. “There’s zero question that the history of the preservation movement in Charleston is a history of elite whites,” says Winslow Hastie about the city’s influential preservation movement that took root during Jim Crow. Hastie is a 13th-generation plantation owner and president and CEO of the nonprofit Historic Charleston Foundation (HCF).The HCF is trying to change the course of a preservation movement that’s neglected Black history and, simultaneously, displaced Black people through restoration projects that systematically gentrified parts of Charleston. Some of that course change is happening at the Foundation’s house museums.At the Aiken-Rhett House, opened in 1996, the audio tour begins with the workspaces and living quarters of the people who were enslaved there. Hastie believes the choice to replace docent-led tours with audio was about achieving consistency as much as avoiding deep-seated bias. “Back then,” he says, referring to the 1990s, “telling true history about the institution of slavery and what it did for the economy of Charleston was more controversial.”“[The order of the tour] subverts the typical narrative where you start at the big fancy house,” continues Hastie, explaining that the Aiken-Rhett House lent itself to a more expansive interpretation of the lives of the enslaved because of the rare “intactness” of the outbuildings.(Who owns history? Americans push to be more inclusive in honoring the past.)At the HCF’s other museum, the Nathaniel Russell House, restoration of the enslaved quarters is currently underway. Hastie calls the 19th-century rats’ nests (or middens) found tucked between the kitchen house walls “time capsules for architectural historians.” The preserved bundles offer clues about the people who lived there: rice husks, scraps of letters, a whole piece of an enslaved man’s—probably a carriage driver’s—livery.More than eight decades since its opening, the Old Slave Mart Museum no longer features Wilson’s collection. The City of Charleston purchased the museum building in 1988, after the attraction closed due to financial woes. Reopened as museum in 2007, the site now covers the evolution of the property and the local slave trade. Although Clarke no longer works there, he still believes the museum will one day embody the “sacred space it has the potential to be.”When Michael Allen joined the National Park Service in June 1980, he noticed that something was missing from the historical narratives at the Charleston properties. At forts Moultrie and Sumter, there was no mention of slavery, even though the forts were built by enslaved laborers. The pest houses where captive Africans were left to quarantine after being hauled across the Atlantic Ocean were absent from information about Sullivan’s Island.Instead, the focus narrowed in on military history: the defeat of the Royal Navy in 1776, and the first shots of the Civil War—a war that, according to the official narrative, was fought over tariffs and states’ rights. “Either I was out of place or the Park Service was out of touch,” Allen says, “and I didn’t believe I was out of place.”(Learn how National Parks are working to combat racism.)Through numerous projects over the course of four decades, Allen helped the Park Service improve its interpretation of Black history. One of those projects included the creation of the Gullah Geechee Heritage Cultural Corridor, which runs along the coast from Pender County, North Carolina to St. Johns County, Florida. The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of West Africans who—due to their isolation on sea and barrier islands during enslavement—retained many of their African traditions and developed distinctive foodways, crafts, spiritual practices, and language. The corridor highlights their vast contribution to the history and culture of the Lowcountry.At the same time that Allen was helping the Park Service expand its interpretive approach, post-Civil Rights Charleston was coming to terms with its incomplete version of public history. The tourists who had powered the city’s economy since the early 1900s were increasingly interested in the Black culture that the city’s leadership suppressed.As African American heritage tourism took off in the 1980s, independent tour guides picked up the slack where official sites lagged. Damon Fordham, who leads a Lost Histories of Black Charleston tour, sees himself as carrying on the storytelling work that’s preserved Charleston’s Black history all these years. “I deal a lot with the obscure and the social situations that lead to them,” says Fordham. One of the stops on his tour is the former City Jail on Magazine Street, where he points out fingerprints in the brick walkway and shares that those bricks likely came from Boone Hall Plantation in Mt. Pleasant—the same place his great-great-grandparents were enslaved.The tides in South Carolina and its oldest city have continued to move toward a fuller representation of Black history; the city council’s unanimous vote to remove the Calhoun statue and (more divided) vote to apologize for slavery attest to that. Sweetgrass baskets, woven with techniques carried over from Africa, is recognized as the state craft. The bridge that crosses the Combahee River where Harriet Tubman raided Confederate troops and freed hundreds of enslaved people bears the abolitionist’s name.These changes are the result of ongoing and centuries-long preservation, protest, and advocacy work, part of what Allen calls “higher consciousness.” He describes the forthcoming International African American Museum as a “linchpin” in the movement forward: “an opportunity for a new generation of people to take the baton and move it further than I could ever imagine.”Jalen Coats is a writer and producer who has worked on projects for VICE, The Huffington Post, and HBO, and is currently based in North Carolina.",
"A drone image shows the area surrounding the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. The statue, erected in 1890, is slated for removal. Protests demanding the removal of racist symbols were sparked by the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Richmond, Virginia’s city hall was packed on July 17th, 1995 with people who had come from as far away as Florida for a hearing on a proposed monument to the late Arthur Ashe, an African American tennis champion and humanitarian who was born in the city. The question was whether to honor Ashe on Richmond’s famous Monument Avenue, which had celebrated General Robert E. Lee since 1890; other Confederate leaders were added in decades that followed.Former Virginia Governor Douglass L. Wilder, the first African American elected governor in the United States since Reconstruction and a longtime friend of Ashe, had lobbied relentlessly for the statue. He and other supporters had been met by ferocious blowback, primarily by people who considered the boulevard a shrine for the preservation of Confederate memories.A crowd gathers at the base of the Arthur Ashe Monument in Richmond, Virginia after a July 10, 1996 ceremony dedicating the statue. In June 2020, the statue of the African American tennis legend and humanitarian was vandalized with the words “White Lives Matter” as demonstrators around the world protested the death of George Floyd while in police custody and demanded an end to police brutality. Red paint was cleaned off by community members.Then Councilwoman Viola Baskerville, a 43-year-old African American, cast her ballot in favor of the Ashe statue.“There was a lot of animosity in that room. You could see it in people’s eyes,” says Baskerville, who went on to serve in the cabinet of Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, now a U.S. senator. “I still believe that a statue of Arthur Ashe belongs on Monument Avenue. It’s a symbol of perseverance and excellence. But we’re fighting ghosts. There’s a lot of blood in the soil. There has been no resolution; we are still restless and torn.”A quarter-century later, the statue of Arthur Ashe may soon be the last one standing on Monument Avenue in Virginia’s capital. In the past month, Confederate monuments adorning the boulevard have either been toppled or are slated for removal. Pushed by a dizzying groundswell of opposition to long standing symbols of the Confederacy and white supremacy, numerous state and local governments, universities, corporations, and entertainers such as the Dixie Chicks and Lady Antebellum, have taken decisive steps to distance their names and brands from iconography of America’s racist past.Few monuments in the U.S.—or around the world, for that matter—seem safe from scrutiny at the moment. Statues of former Presidents George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, and Theodore Roosevelt have become high-profile targets for attack or removal. There are discordant rumblings about the mixed moral legacies of the four celebrated U.S. presidents memorialized in granite on Mount Rushmore. British colonial-era politicians Winston Churchill and Cecil Rhodes and even anti-colonial Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi have come into the crosshairs of statue abolitionists.A worker cleans the Winston Churchill statue in London, England’s Parliament Square that had been spray painted with the words 'Was a racist' on June 8, 2020 amid anti-racism protests. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave-trader, and tossed it into the harbor.The statue of Mahatma Gandhi in London’s Parliament Square is boarded up following Black Lives Matter protests across the United Kingdom.Demonstrators at the University of Oxford, holding placards during a protest arranged by the 'Rhodes Must Fall' campaign, called for the removal of a statue of British businessman and imperialist Cecil John Rhodes on June 9, 2020. Thousands of people called for the removal of the statue as debate raged about dismantling monuments to the nation's colonial past. Protesters chanted "Take it down!" and "Decolonise!" and held signs that said "Rhodes Must Fall" and "Black Lives Matter" in front of the statue at Oxford’s Oriel College. Governors of the University of Oxford voted to remove the Rhodes statue.A major reconsideration of how the history of colonialization, slavery, and white supremacy is taught and viewed, especially through public art and memorials, is furiously underway. It grew out of social unrest and a tense reexamination of race relations that has raged since video emerged of George Floyd pinned to the ground and dying under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020. Calls for change started long before that awful encounter. Floyd’s blood served as gasoline on a smoldering fire. (African Americans have always fought for their rights—now the movement is global.)Now, tough questions are being asked globally. What symbols from our past must be reconsidered or simply discarded? What stories demand a more complete and honest retelling? How should history be taught?Using contemporary values to judge the moral failings and atrocities of ancestors and to reevaluate the lives and legacies of canonized leaders is an explosive calculus. Nonetheless, a growing number of nations seem ready to embrace the moral deconstruction of the past to understand and improve the present.The removal of monuments and symbols to a racist past is an important step to a more just future. Some scholars see the current waves of activism that sprouted primarily from the Black Lives Matter movement as a precursor to overdue structural reform.Demonstrators attempt to topple the Albert Pike statue in Washington, DC on June 19, 2020.A statue of Jefferson Davis lies on the street after protesters pulled it down in Richmond, Virginia, on June 10, 2020.  Symbols of the Confederacy, which supported slavery, are being targeted for removal following the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.A portrait of George Floyd and other victims of police brutality are projected on the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia June 8, 2020. Video and light designer Dustin Klein created the projection in honor of Floyd, who died under the knee of a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam says the Confederate statue will be removed.“The racial justice movement currently underway is unprecedented and can be considered a game changer. The way many people look at the world has literally changed in weeks,” said Kevin K. Gaines, Julian Bond Professor of Civil Rights and Social Justice at the University of Virginia.“Majority-Black protests like we’ve seen in the past can be marginalized or discounted. But now when you see little white kids and college students posting Black Lives Matter on Instagram, the narrative isn’t so easy to corrupt. When you see an elderly white man knocked down by police in Buffalo while peacefully protesting, the demands of a movement are not easily discarded or ignored. Dominant national myths are being exploded. This is a transformational moment not only in the United States but around the globe. In the United States this is a multi-racial movement under the banner of Black Lives Matter. That’s what’s novel and unprecedented about this effort,” said Gaines. (Hear from those demanding racial justice in Washington, D.C.)The assault on effigies of racial supremacists from bygone eras has proven contagious. British demonstrators in Bristol tore down a bronze statue of Edward Colston, an infamous 17th Century slave trader, and tossed it into a harbor; a week later, the governors of the University of Oxford voted to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes was a mining magnate who ruled over the British Cape Colony in what is today South Africa and paved the path for South Africa’s system of apartheid. The man responsible for the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship was an unabashed white supremacist who viewed the indigenous Black population of South Africa as an inferior race.Demonstrators throw the statue of Edward Colston, an infamous 17th century slave trader, into Bristol harbor during a Black Lives Matter protest rally.Now, an argument percolates on the Oxford campus and beyond: How far should any university go to challenge the past?"My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment," Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of Oxford, told the BBC. "We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did," she said."This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years, the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? Personally, no—I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time," she said.A similar debate is raging over Christopher Columbus and which historical legacies need to be challenged. A statue of the Italian seafarer has stood outside City Hall in Columbus, Ohio, since 1955. Just as it is in other places throughout the Americas, the bronze image is slated for removal. Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said the statue, a gift from the citizens of Genoa, Italy, will be placed in storage “in favor of diversity and inclusion.” The mayor of America’s 15th largest city didn’t stop there. Earlier this month he offered a scathing sentiment of the city’s patron saint.“For many people in our community, the statue represents patriarchy, oppression and divisiveness. That does not represent our great city, and we will no longer live in the shadow of our ugly past,” said Ginter.But how should Columbus now be remembered? The explorer has long been credited with “discovering” the Americas while in search of riches of East Asia. Scholars occasionally offered brief nods to the inhumane treatment indigenous people suffered at the hand of Columbus and his hired seafarers–such as rape and enslavement–but he had long been considered the father of the “New World.”A protective covering surrounds the statue of former U.S. President George Washington in London’s Trafalgar Square. Protests were sparked in communities around the world following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.“The work of historians over the last century has shown that Columbus was a controversial figure during his own life, because of his actions that supported the genocide of indigenous populations in Hispaniola,” says Ana-Lucia Araujo, a professor of history at Howard University.“Columbus represents the European conquest of the Americas that led to the killing and the enslavement of Native American populations, and then the massive importation of enslaved Africans to the Americas.”“I believe that the study of slavery, the Atlantic slave trade and the history of populations of African descent should be made mandatory at the school level and the university level,” added Araujo, author of the forthcoming book Slavery In The Age Of Memory. “The United States remains segregated. White Americans must understand that slavery is not about black history. It is American history. It is the history of the victims and the perpetrators, and in order to not keep repeating the atrocities of the past, we need to know this history, even though it may feel uncomfortable.”Columbus Day became a federal holiday in the U.S. in 1937. But should his legacy be celebrated? Not only are statues of Confederate soldiers and celebrated colonizers being ripped from pedestals or rushed into cold storage, large portions of American life are now also considered ripe for rigorous review.Quaker Oats and Mars, Inc. are making plans to remove popular but polarizing stereotypes advertising Aunt Jemima’s maple syrup and Uncle Ben’s rice. The sports and entertainment industries are also undergoing reckonings. NASCAR has banned the Confederate flag at its events, and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell has apologized for not listening to players’ concern about the historical mistreatment of African Americans.Politicians are racing to properly position themselves on the quickly evolving racial landscape. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that “Juneteenth” will be recognized as a paid state holiday starting next year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the portraits of four House Speakers who served in the Confederacy to be removed from the halls of the U.S. Capitol building. And various cities and counties throughout the nation are studying ordinances to label racism a public health crisis.Workers remove a painting of former Confederate House Speaker Howell Cobb of Georgia from the east staircase of the speakers lobby in the U.S. Capitol on June 18, 2020.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the removal of four portraits of former house speakers who served in the Confederacy, saying their images symbolize "grotesque racism." The other outgoing portraits are Robert Hunter of Virginia, James Orr of South Carolina, and Charles Crisp of Georgia.Earlier this month, Clemson University stripped the name of former Vice President John C. Calhoun, a slavery proponent, from its honors college. The University of Southern California removed the name of Rufus B. von KleinSmid, a noted eugenicist, from a prominent building on its campus. Princeton University removed the name of Woodrow Wilson, America’s 28th president, from its school of public policy, because of what a university statement called his “racist thinking.”“Wilson’s racism was significant and consequential even by the standards of his own time,” Princeton’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, said in the statement.Rhode Island announced that it was changing its name from “Rhode Island and Providence Plantation” to just “Rhode Island.” And the Republican-controlled Mississippi state legislature just passed a measure to redesign the state’s flag, which has been embedded with the Confederate battle flag since 1894, three decades after the Civil War, and has long inflamed racial tensions. (Here's why the Confederate flag gained popularity in the 20th century.)How history will judge us a century from now is anyone’s guess. It seems likely the emerging generation of young scholars and social activists will be remembered for challenging systems of oppression and racial hierarchy.Yet as philosopher-poet George Santayana famously said, those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. The aphorism weighs heavily on those trained to study the behaviors and achievements of past cultures.“As a historian, I am concerned about the past being erased,” says Gaines, the UVA professor. "If we sanitize our history, we run the risk of forgetting how we’ve progressed and changed over time…Those who come after us must understand that America was conceived in white supremacy and continues to suffer the consequences.”In his best-selling memoir, In The Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History, former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu recounts the volatile emotions stirred when he orchestrated the removal of four highly visible Confederate monuments from his city in 2017. He called the decision an important step toward racial justice and healing.“Symbols matter. We use them in telling the stories of our past and who we are, and we choose them carefully. Once I learned the real history of these statues, I knew there was only one path forward, and that meant making straight what was crooked, making right what was wrong. It starts with telling the truth about the past,” wrote Landrieu.The irony that Arthur Ashe could well be the last man standing on Richmond’s Monument Avenue is testament to the power of sustained moral protest.",
"Widely referred to as Mahatma, meaning great soul or saint in Sanskrit, Gandhi helped India reach independence through a philosophy of non-violent non-cooperation.He’s been called the “father of India” and a “great soul in beggar’s garb." His nonviolent approach to political change helped India gain independence after nearly a century of British colonial rule. A frail man with a will of iron, he provided a blueprint for future social movements around the world. He was Mahatma Gandhi, and he remains one of the most revered figures in modern history.Born Mohandas Gandhi in Gujarat, India in 1869, he was part of an elite family. After a period of teenage rebellion, he left India to study law in London. Before going, he promised his mother he’d again abstain from sex, meat, and alcohol in an attempt to re-adopt strict Hindu morals.A portrait of Gandhi as a young man.In 1893, at the age of 24, the new attorney moved to the British colony of Natal in southeastern Africa to practice law. Natal was home to thousands of Indians whose labor had helped build its wealth, but the colony fostered both formal and informal discrimination against people of Indian descent. Gandhi was shocked when he was thrown out of train cars, roughed up for using public walkways, and segregated from European passengers on a stagecoach.In 1894, Natal stripped all Indians of their ability to vote. Gandhi organized Indian resistance, fought anti-Indian legislation in the courts and led large protests against the colonial government. Along the way, he developed a public persona and a philosophy of truth-focused, non-violent non-cooperation he called Satyagraha.Gandhi brought Satyagraha to India in 1915, and was soon elected to the Indian National Congress political party. He began to push for independence from the United Kingdom, and organized resistance to a 1919 law that gave British authorities carte blanche to imprison suspected revolutionaries without trial. Britain responded brutally to the resistance, mowing down 400 unarmed protesters in the Amritsar Massacre.A map of Gandhi’s 1930 protest march against a law compelling Indians to purchase British salt.Now Gandhi pushed even harder for home rule, encouraging boycotts of British goods and organizing mass protests. In 1930, he began a massive satyagraha campaign against a British law that forced Indians to purchase British salt instead of producing it locally. Gandhi organized a 241-mile-long protest march to the west coast of Gujarat, where he and his acolytes harvested salt on the shores of the Arabian Sea. In response, Britain imprisoned over 60,000 peaceful protesters and inadvertently generated even more support for home rule.Children in Rajkot, Gujarat, where Gandhi spent most of his boyhood, dressed as the legendary activist to celebrate what would have been his 144th birthday in 2013. This year will mark Gandhi’s 150th birthday.By then, Gandhi had become a national icon, and was widely referred to as Mahatma, Sanskrit for great soul or saint. Imprisoned for a year because of the Salt March, he became more influential than ever. He protested discrimination against the “untouchables,” India’s lowest caste, and negotiated unsuccessfully for Indian home rule. Undeterred, he began the Quit India movement, a campaign to get Britain to voluntarily withdraw from India during World War II. Britain refused and arrested him yet again.Huge demonstrations ensued, and despite the arrests of 100,000 home rule advocates by British authorities, the balance finally tipped toward Indian independence. A frail Gandhi was released from prison in 1944, and Britain at last began to make plans to withdraw from the Indian subcontinent. It was bittersweet for Gandhi, who opposed the partition of India and attempted to quell Hindu-Muslim animosity and deadly riots in 1947.India finally gained its independence in August 1947. But Gandhi only saw it for a few months; a Hindu extremist assassinated him on January 30, 1948. Over 1.5 million people marched in his massive funeral procession.Ascetic and unflinching, Gandhi changed the face of civil disobedience around the world. Martin Luther King, Jr. drew on his tactics during the Civil Rights Movement, and the Dalai Lama was inspired by his teachings, which are still heralded by those who seek to inspire change without inciting violence.But though his legacy still resonates, others wonder whether Gandhi should be revered. Among some Indian Hindus, he remains controversial for his embrace of Muslims. Others question whether he did enough to challenge the Indian caste system. He has also been criticized for supporting racial segregation between black and white South Africans and making derogatory remarks about black people. And though he supported women’s rights in some regards, he also opposed contraception and invited young women to sleep in his bed naked as a way of testing his sexual self-control.Mohandas Gandhi the man was complex and flawed. However, Mahatma Gandhi the public figure left an indelible mark on the history of India and on the exercise of civil disobedience worldwide. “After I am gone, no single person will be able completely to represent me,” he said. “But a little bit of me will live in many of you. If each puts the cause first and himself last, the vacuum will to a large extent be filled.”",
"Flowers, signs, and balloons are left near a makeshift memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died while in custody of the Minneapolis police on May 25.The video frame of George Floyd on Facebook, handcuffed on his stomach as a Minneapolis police officer presses his knee into Floyd’s neck, feels narrowed.Floyd lies immobilized, groaning on the pavement as cars rush by, police radios beep and bystanders gather, yelling that Floyd’s nose is bleeding, that he is subdued, cursing and entreating the officers. “Let him breathe, man!” one bystander yelled.“Please, man!” Floyd begs as he is ground into the pavement. His pleas mix with the ambient noises around him. They are the disjointed sounds from the clash of belief systems and competing visions of sovereignty, of ownership, of authority over black bodies compressed into the narrow frame of Floyd’s last moments.“Momma!” Floyd, 46, calls out. “Momma! I’m through,” the dying man says, and I recognize his words. A call to your mother is a prayer to be seen. Floyd’s mother died two years ago, but he used her as a sacred invocation.“He is a human being!” comes an anguished plea from someone in a desperate attempt to engage the officers’ reason or compassion or oaths of office. But in that moment, those officers are beyond the reach of humanity. Not Floyd’s, but their own.I didn’t want to click on the video. I didn’t want to see another police snuff film. I didn’t want to watch whatever it is that compels someone to put his knee into a man’s neck, until he can no longer draw breath. But I heard this black man had called out to his momma as he lay dying, and I too am a black mother. One of the ones since time immemorial who have to answer the sacred call. Who have to answer the call for the divine sisterhood of black mothers. Even when they are not our own, we are asked to bear witness.I was in the delivery room with my son, in pain with no medication, save the one that magnified my contractions. As my vision narrowed, I focused on a point above me and I heard the nurses talking about me as if I wasn’t there. I stared at the ceiling and over and over I called out for my mother. There are moments when it feels like life hangs in the balance, and in those moments, we want to go back to the beginning, when we were known.Dying soldiers called out for their mothers, according to Civil War battlefield reports. Last year, an article from The Atlantic cited a hospice nurse. “Almost everyone is calling for ‘Mommy’ or ‘Mama’ with the last breath.”We are the ballast. The anchors. A way for those who are close to the edge to find their way back, or their way home. This is true for black mothers, who are especially tested and learned in all the dread fates of black bodies. We are the hedge against the people who don’t see us. We are an assertion of black life.For black people who feel they are about to be taken from themselves, we are the assurance of memory, of justice, of 10-hour waits to cast our ballots at polling places. We will not be moved.I have often imagined 14-year-old Emmett Till calling for his momma, Mamie Till-Mobley, as he was kidnapped, tortured and killed over the false witness of Carolyn Bryant Donham, whom America had invested with the savage idea of white womanhood. The black mother’s answer was to throw open her son’s casket and change the nation.It is the duty of black mothers made sacred by all the ugly Karens (Beckys, Katies, et al.), who threaten to call the police on black people because they understand the country we live in. It has been made sacred by all the admonitions, and prayers — all the side deals we try to cut with our God when black boys cross streets, or play in parks, or get into cars, or grow into men who do anything at all while being black.It is made sacred by our need to protect against all the people who think they hold dominion over black lives. Who overpolice or underfund, or over-report, or wag their fingers in our faces. The vacant-looking father and son with rifles in Georgia, the masked female portfolio manager waving her cellphone in New York, the reptilian officer who has learned how to kneel a man to death in Minnesota, may not see themselves. But we, the black mothers, see you.As bystanders scream at Minneapolis officers, “He’s dying. You’re f—ing killing him,” Floyd is no longer moving, he is perhaps already dead. In the ways black people have trained themselves to look at these things, in his final breaths, he has already won.To call out to his mother is to be known to his maker. The one who gave him to her. I watched the Floyd video, for us, the living. It’s my sacred charge. I am a black mother.",
"Philomena Wankenge, a member of the group Freedom Fighters DC, speaks to a crowd at the Lincoln Memorial during Saturday’s demonstrations in Washington, D.C. “We didn’t ask for a street named after us, what we asked for is the defunding of the police,” Wankenge said. “Don’t underestimate the youth because we are a force to be reckoned with.”The week began with anguished shouts and chants, heavily armed police and fumes of tear gas in the area around Washington, D.C.’s Lafayette Square Park.On Saturday, almost as many people pushing baby strollers as carrying signs streamed into that same area to protest the death of George Floyd, who died violently on Memorial Day as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Mohamed Bundu, 20, left, and Genesis Ramos, 19, both from Maryland, sit on the outskirts of a march heading from the Lincoln Memorial to Lafayette Park. “Seeing everyone come together like this is just indescribable for me. It means a lot," Mohamed said.Henry Couch thinks the growing protest movement in America underscores how many people believe in the same cause. “I think it unites people as a country ... across race and gender.”Nia Stewart says she came to the protests in Washington, D.C., "with my flowers and my kids to bring good energy."Howard University student Shel Evans, 30, brought her daughter, Christin Jackson, 9, to Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House because she “wanted her to be able to see this. This is history."Michael Shipman, 60, sits on a bench with his son Ayzeyh Johnson, 10. "I don't want to sit back and benefit from the change, I want to be a part of the change. I'm trying to teach him the same thing."Most major cities in the United States reported large demonstrations, and many were organized in small-town America as well. Around the world people joined in largely peaceful protests sparked by the death of Floyd, in a dramatic push to elevate the issue of police brutality and what has been characterized as a “pandemic” of racism and white supremacy. From London to Nairobi, Berlin to Tokyo, Melbourne to Beijing, people marched to major public venues where speeches, songs and silent demonstrations on bended knee were designed to send a message: Police brutality, racial violence and racism must stop.The worldwide protests Saturday occurred one day after what would have been the 27th birthday of Breonna Taylor, the African American emergency medical technician who was killed in her Louisville, Kentucky, home in March by police officers who forcibly entered the wrong apartment while executing a warrant.News of her death, along with other racially motivated killings in the U.S., such as that of jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February, culminated in a spasm of violence, fires and lootings that erupted shortly after Floyd’s death. As America’s racial tensions were telegraphed around the world, conversations about the need to dismantle white supremacy, defund police departments and toughen laws about race-related crimes rose to the top of national discourse. (Related: Read about the long history of racial violence against black Americans.)By June 6, it seemed the need to bear witness and register dissent was a motivating factor for protesters around the world. Thousands gathered in the 16th Street corridor, renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and adorned in gigantic yellow block letters, that ended right in front of the church where President Donald Trump hoisted a bible before flashing cameras.Deangelo Garvin, 23, of Washington, D.C., holds his son, DJ, 4, around the corner from where protests are in full swing. “I came out because I’m a proud black man,” Deangelo said.Protesters spray-paint the words "defund the police" on a signboard.The slogan “Black Lives Matter” now echoes around the world as tens of thousands of people in major capital cities in the United States and around the world marched Saturday.The Crutchfield family strikes a pose. They said they came to the protest to experience the atmosphere and are hopeful systemic change will come.In fact, Saturday was Messiah McKinley’s 12th birthday, and his parents Vondell and Yamica wanted to bring him and his 10-year-old brother Yeshua to Black Lives Matter Plaza because they face a parenting dilemma shared by many African American parents.“I want them to be strong and independent, and know how to express themselves clearly,” Vondell McKinley says. “I want them to move through the world confident, and not have any fear about what they believe. But they also need to understand the reality of life, and how sometimes, they have to be aware that interacting with the police means they have to think twice about what they say.” (Related: "For Black Motorists, a Never-Ending Fear of Being Stopped.")McKinley worries about what the future holds for his sons, but he also sees reason for optimism. “They learned a lot today. This was the first time they had ever been in a crowd that big, and I think the signs and the way people were interacting had an impact on them. They needed to be there.”By noon, the crowd at the base of the Lincoln Memorial was chanting the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and many others through bullhorns. Verses of spirituals like “Wade in the Water” and “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” echoed along the mall, in a steadily growing crowd near the reflecting pool. By evening, an estimated 10,000 people passed peacefully through major thoroughfares in D.C. leading to the Capitol and farther along 16th Street to Malcolm X Park.Serenity Plight, far right, raises her fist in solidarity with a group of other young women in Black Lives Matter Plaza. "Everything we are seeing in the news right now, I feel like I am living in a movie. I don’t want this to be our new normal. All I see is murder and mayhem right now. It’s crazy.”For some, the events evoked strong memories of similar marches. Carol Williams, 61, moved back to D.C. from Gainesville, Florida, last December. She came out on Saturday, wearing a Malcolm X t-shirt, for her four children, 20 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. “I’ve been walking and fighting and praying since 1972.”Williams says her older sister Faye Williams used to own the popular Sisterspace and Books store on U Street before gentrification made it too expensive to keep the doors open. “I’m still fighting this racism for the people. Sometimes it feels like nothing has changed, but we gon’ change it this year. I love the white people who care about us, but I don’t bite my tongue and the Lord knows my heart, and we gon’ stop this today.”And as in many other cities in America, the crowds consisted of just as many white people as black and brown marchers.Ben and Sarah Peisch came with son Avery, 5, and daughters Noelle, 3, Naomi, 2 and 8-month-old Audrey. The journey from their Columbia Heights neighborhood to the White House posed a different type of challenge.Avery attends a diverse public school kindergarten, and the Peisches have many friends who are people of color. But it’s hard to explain the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd to a little boy looking for heroes.Neil Gladstein, 59, left, and Lynn Rhinehardt, 58, both from Silver Spring, Maryland, stand on the outskirts of the protest along Black Lives Matter Plaza. “We want to be part of changing our country so it’s a more just and fair place for all people. Especially, right now, black people," Rhinehardt said.Maria Modlin, also known as Yaya, 55, from Washington, D.C., marched with a group of protesters from the Lincoln Memorial to Lafayette Park. "I am so happy to be alive at this time to be a part of this great movement. It’s we the people. Not them the people. Now, it’s our turn,” she said.Annah Faju, 28, from the Washington, D.C., area, rests on the outskirts of the protest. Faju is a visual artist who brought her own hand-painted face mask to the protest. She said she came “just to see people’s faces. To see how many people are actually out here today that actually do care is overwhelming for sure.”“He’s very much into the concept of ‘good guys and bad guys,’” Ben Peisch says. “Trying to explain to him that sometimes people are treated badly, but it’s not because they did bad things, is hard. That’s what we’ve been working on.” (Related: Learn how to talk to your kids about race.)But the Peisches have brought their children to several other marches and vigils since Floyd's death, and they intend to continue the tradition."We both have backgrounds in education, and we want to be sure to expose them to causes like social justice," Ben Peisch says. We want to 'bake' advocacy into their DNA.”But for many older white Americans, their presence was the first step toward publicly acknowledging the severity of America’s racial crisis and lending their support.As Trina Wolf sat on the curb in front of St. John’s Church near the White House, she held a sign bearing the phrase “I Will Never Understand, But I Stand.” Wolf also carried homemade face masks she’s been making since the COVID-19 outbreak began, and which she was giving away to fellow marchers.Dairyienne Briggs blocks the sun’s rays with an umbrella near the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool. “I hope to see a change in the police’s actions,” she says of her reason for participating in the Washington protest.The 58-year-old Michigan native has attended many marches for social justice in Washington, D.C., but says this one feels different. “I just think it’s terrible what’s going on in our country and what has gone on forever. I just think that as a white person, I need to be here.”Wolf says she has several right-wing family members and friends who are good people, but who dismiss talk about marches and demonstrations and racial injustice.“They frankly think that all the bad news is just fake. They haven’t felt it, they don’t understand it, and I don’t think people that are white can ever really understand how it feels. But we need to let the world know that we support people who do live these things every day.”",
"Over the weekend, intense protests fueled by the killing of an African-American man by a white police officer in Minneapolis took place around the world. No matter how much we want to shield our children from these upsetting images, kids will likely be overhearing conversations about race, racial differences, and racism—and asking questions. Experts say that how you answer could shape your children’s feelings about race for years to come.“This moment in time provides people with an opportunity,” says Candra Flanagan, director of teaching and learning for the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). “Adults might want to turn off the TV or be silent. But kids are getting their information and understanding from other places. It makes it that much more important to have these conversations so they aren’t getting outside messages different from what [parents] want them to have.”For some parents, the protests taking place after the death of George Floyd will result in their children’s first questions about race and racism. Those initial conversations can be unnerving, but educators urge parents not to shy away from them, even if the children are young. Underestimating their ability to comprehend issues around race and injustice would be a mistake, says Caryn Park, a professor at Antioch University in Seattle, whose research focuses on children’s understanding of race and ethnicity.“Children as young as three years old are aware of race and skin color, and they aren’t afraid to ask questions,” Park says. “Their identities really matter to them, and racial identity is a significant part of their total identity. They also understand the power in talking about race and racism, and that when they bring those things up, they can get the attention of grown-ups and other children.”Race is relatively simple to address when a young child notices skin color for the first time. Racism is understandably harder to talk about. Few parents would consider themselves or their children racist, with its connotations of intentional, angry, or mean behavior against different groups of people. But according to Ibram X. Kendi, executive director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University in Washington, D.C., intention isn’t always part of racism.What that means, Kendi says, is though most people don’t intend any harm, they’re still making judgments based on race. And according to Maggie Beneke, assistant professor of education at the University of Washington, often those judgments come from implicit racial bias, something we might internalize through everyday interactions and social messaging, resulting in beliefs that we might not even realize we have but can still cause unintentional racist behavior. “For instance, after viewing movies with mostly white princesses, a child might say something like, ‘I only like princesses who look like Elsa, and I don’t like Moana’s brown hair and skin,’” says Beneke, who studies equity in education.The goal, Kendi says, is to raise children who are antiracist. “As parents,” says Kendi, author of the upcoming Antiracist Baby board book and co-author with Jason Reynolds of the young adult book, Stamped: Racism, Antiracism and You, “we should raise children who can express notions of racial equality, who can see racial disparities as a problem, and who can do their own small part to challenge this big problem of racism.” And that means recognizing racist ideas kids might have internalized—unintentionally or not—and steering them toward antiracist behavior.Developing empathy, compassion, and a sense of justice at an early age helps kids grow into adults who want to help make the world a better place. For parents, that often means taking a deep breath and having those tough conversations about race and racism. “Regardless of how the conversation begins, parents should be sending the signal that it’s OK and important to talk about it,” Beneke says. Here’s what the experts had to say about raising an antiracist child.If the recent uprisings prompt your children to ask questions about race and protest, use the moment as a starting point for a broader conversation, Flanagan says. Part of those conversations will require some deep thinking by adults.“It’s not just about the child but the work that the adult needs to be doing,” says Anna Hindley, director of early education at the NAAMHC. Understanding the history of race relations in the country and the variety of ways that demonstrations can take place will make it easier to discuss these subjects with kids. (Check out these articles for children about African-American heroes, including Martin Luther King, Jr.)For instance the NAAMHC recently launched Talking About Race, a web portal with resources to help parents and teachers navigate the discussion with concrete tools. It introduces the idea of oppression as “a combination of prejudice and institutional power that creates a system that regularly and severely discriminates against some groups and benefits other groups.” It’s a good prompt to have kids think about what might have led to these global protests beyond the death of one man: that African-Americans are disproportionately poorer than other groups of Americans, that this group has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 because of access to healthcare and other reasons, and that Black people are killed (“hurt,” if you have younger children) by police officers at a much higher rate than white people.Both Hindley and Beneke suggest that withholding that information from children might hurt their ability to process issues around race and oppression.“We know that children are capable [of understanding], but they might need some support given all the messages that they’re receiving about themselves and others,” Beneke says.However, Flanagan reminds parents that children—just like adults—are being impacted emotionally by events like the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests. Conversations should keep those feelings in mind.“We respond in emotional ways to many of the injustices we see across time and all over the world,” she says. “Give space to kids for their own emotional journeys and their own emotional unpacking.”If your child says, “That lady is brown!” and she is, then just agree with her. “It’s not racist to notice someone’s race,” Park says. “An unwillingness to acknowledge her observation might send the wrong message to the child.”What parents do need to listen for are any value judgments kids may be unknowingly placing on those differences, and then gently correct them. “Respond with open, non-judgmental questions to understand why your child might be making that assumption,” Beneke says. “Simple questions like ‘Why do you think that?’ or ‘What makes you say that?’ can help get the conversation started.” You can then explain what stereotypes are, and then work with your child to think about examples that show how these stereotypes aren’t actually true.If you hear your child expressing an idea about a group of people that they don’t realize is prejudicial, engage them in an age-appropriate conversation about it. For younger children, you might center the conversation around why the words are hurtful and how they might make someone feel. And though most older kids have been socialized not to make blatantly racist comments, they can crop up. Park encourages parents to help children examine both the statement’s intent and its unintended impact. For instance, your child saying that “People of color can also be racist,” is an invitation for a conversation. “Ask the child if something happened to make them feel that way, and talk about what they were feeling when they made that comment,” Park says. “Who benefits and who loses from such a comment? Listen supportively for hurt feelings of rejection or exclusion, and think about a plan to reconcile those feelings.”The older the child, the more sophisticated the conversation can be. “But we should never shy away from pointing out racist ideas to our children,” Kendi says. “And we should never shy away from protecting our children with antiracist ideas.”Take a hard look at the books, movies, and TV shows your child is consuming, and you’ll likely notice a pattern about which groups are represented the most. Consider introducing your family to media that reboots notions around what a hero, neighbor, or friend might look like.“We know that the majority of picture books centers around white characters, and that Black and brown human characters are even less represented than animals and other cartoon characters,” Beneke says. Look for books that feature Black, brown, and indigenous characters in normal situations, not only the ones that focus on enslavement or injustice.Look for books with illustrations and stories that celebrate diversity and expose your child to different perspectives. Find something great? Buy an extra copy and donate it to your school’s library.In order for kids to embrace antiracist ideals, they need to be exposed to people who are different from them. If their friend group looks a little too similar, it might be time to encourage a little diversity at those playdates.It can also be an opportunity for parents to bring more diversity into their everyday lives as well. Manka Varghese, a University of Washington professor who specializes in multilingual education, suggests expanding your own social network to include race, gender, ability, and religion. This models antiracist behavior to your children and provides an opportunity to talk about the value of difference. “It has a trickle-down effect for children because you’re suggesting that different is good,” Park says. “It gives children access to a range of perspectives, foods, stories, and points of view.”Of course, the goal isn’t to simply run out and make a friend simply because the person is a different race. Instead, examine what you might be doing unconsciously that limits who your family interacts with. “Think about where you as a parent or family are investing time and resources,” Beneke says. Consider trying out an extracurricular activity in a new-to-you neighborhood, or exploring beyond your normal weekend activities to allow for relationships to develop naturally.Look for other activities that will expose your children to different perspectives. Try attending events at your local library, visiting museum exhibits that touch on race, or stopping in at cultural events at local community centers year-round. Exposure can help broaden the idea of inclusiveness.You don’t have to set up a time to have a “race talk.” Conversations can naturally occur if you’re paying attention to your child’s statements and staying aware of ways that unconscious bias can slip in.For instance, if your child notices a commercial that lacks cultural diversity, chat with him about how the ad could be more inclusive. If your tween is wondering why there aren’t any Black people on Friends, engage with her on what might make the show more representative. “Encourage critical thinking and invite tweens into conversation about what they notice,” Park says. The conversation could lead to a "diversity audit" of the media you both consume to track people of color in leading, supportive, authority figure, hero, and villain roles. Then come back together to compare notes. Based on what you find, you might want to make changes to your media diet.You can also look for ways that you as a parent can naturally call out disparities too. If your child points out that most professional basketball players are African American, it’s OK to also bring up that most of the team owners are white, and to ask what your child thinks that means. Varghese suggests engaging your child with questions like “What do you notice here? Why do you think that is? Who benefits from the situation? What can we do about it?” The answers can lead to fruitful discussions about privilege, race, and inequality—and help your child develop antiracist ideals.Above all, remember that there’s no one “right” way to have these conversations. Just like other important and uncomfortable conversations, you might find yourself wishing you’d answered a question differently in retrospect. Own it.“This takes practice,” Beneke says. “Model that even though you’re a grown-up, you’re still thinking through these ideas as an adult. Show them that these are hard conversations to have, but also important ones.”",
"Fourth-grader Sarina Lee likes shopping for cool clothes. What the suburban New Yorker doesn’t like is being told by retailers that some of the styles she craves are “boys’” clothes. For instance, recently she ordered a pair of sneakers. “They came to us way too large because the measurement was for ‘boy sizes,’” says her mom, Glenna. After discovering she had male friends who’d also been put off by gendered items and activities, Sarina decided to set her frustration to work.“Sarina approached her principals about starting a club at school called ‘The Gender Acceptance Project,’ giving children the space to be who they are and not who they’re expected to be,” Lee says. Next up: Sarina plans to launch a supportive community for students to learn about gender stereotypes as well as start a letter-writing campaign to ask corporations to rethink gendered advertising.This kind of passion for a cause is a hopeful sign of things to come, especially after a year like 2020 that brought everything from the pandemic to climate change to racial justice into children’s lives.And it turns out that being a young activist has benefits beyond changing the world. According to a 2018 study published in Child Development, change-makers often make more money later in life and reach higher levels of education than non-activists. And, according to multiple surveys, college student activists tend to be happier and have better social well-being.Activism brings developmental benefits, too, like learning how to express ideas effectively and engage with others. "You need to be able to communicate your passion, to be somebody who engages others and excites others about an issue,” says Nancy Deutsch, education professor at the University of Virginia and director of the Youth-Nex Center to Promote Effective Youth Development.Change-makers often share certain traits, qualities that experts have found again and again in young activists that make them so successful. Here’s how those qualities look in some famous young change-makers—and how you can bring out those traits in your own little activist.Making a difference “takes a level of empathy and perspective-taking,” Deutsch says. “You need to figure out what the issue is, and how to speak it in a way that brings other people along.” Before Sarina formed her club, she surveyed her community so she could understand other students’, teachers’, and parents’ feelings about her cause. She’ll use the information to create a slideshow she can share at her school.How you can raise an empathetic change-maker. “Emphasize that all change involves differences, conflict, and compromise,” suggests Gene Beresin, executive director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital. Gently presenting both sides of a story and playing devil’s advocate with your child can help, too—you can foster empathy by showing your kids what each side has to gain and lose. By understanding other people’s points of view, Deutsch says, it’s also easier to argue in a way that can be heard.“Every social change movement requires people with all different skills and talents,” Deutsch says. “The best thing you can do for a movement is figure out what your skills and strengths are.” For instance, the Standing Rock movement gained much attention after a young photographer named Tina Malia captured an image of U.S. military veterans kneeling in front of Native Americans.“You don’t necessarily have to take to the streets in a rally, or lead an effort to save a river,” says Beresin, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School. A kid can also write letters to city officials or school leaders, or participate in civic events. “Understand what their values and missions are,” he says. “Combine that with the knowledge of their kid’s strengths and weaknesses.” Then make suggestions. Can they be a writer? Produce a blog? Take photographs?Greta Thunberg’s firebrand 2019 speech at the United Nations made one thing clear: She has strong feelings about climate change. And while her powerful words polarized some audiences, they received a lot of attention. That passion is key to a successful movement. “The cause doesn’t have to be something that’s Earth-shattering,” says Adam Edwards, co-author of Surmountable: How Citizens From Selma to Seoul Changed the World. “But finding something you’re passionate about is definitely a common thread.”How you can raise a passionate child. “Have frequent conversations involving your child’s values, ideals, missions, and objectives,” suggests Beresin, who was a youth activist in the 1960s. “Listen to what’s important to them.” To inspire more passion, you can point out loved ones in your child’s life who are affected by the issues they care about—for instance, a friend who was once homeless, or a healthcare worker who needs personal protective equipment.Change rarely happens as quickly as kids might expect, and though that can be disappointing at first, it teaches patience and resilience. Malala Yousafzai started writing about educating women in Afghanistan when she was 11; at age 15, she was targeted and shot by the Taliban. But just nine months later, she spoke openly about girls’ education at UN headquarters in New York. Today, the Malala Fund has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build schools to help girls, but millions are still waiting to be educated. Sticking with a movement even when it gets tough is critical for budding change-makers. “I love the phrase ‘Nevertheless, she persisted,’” Edwards says.How you can raise a child who perseveres. “Let young people know that even the smallest changes locally are part of the solution,” Beresin says. You can point out how they’re already making a difference bit by bit, whether it’s using less electricity at home or helping a local student learn to read. Talking about great activists can also help when things gets tough. Deutsch points to civil rights activist John Lewis’ lifelong efforts as an example of major changes coming gradually.“It can be seductive to look at individual leaders,” Deutsch says. “But in reality, move-ments are made and change is made by large groups of people working together.” Martin Luther King, Jr., was a powerful leader and organizer, yet without working with freedom riders to challenge bus segregation, sit-in participants who wouldn’t leave lunch counters, or children who marched so their parents wouldn’t lose their jobs, the civil rights movement would not have succeeded.How you can raise a team player. Helping your child find a meaningful group to join can offer them the strength and significance of a team. “It’s really a core part of humans that we need to feel that we have a sense of purpose, that we’re here to do something,” Deutsch says. Sports are great, but becoming a team player can also mean joining a school club, participating in choir or band, or attending a house of worship. Says Beresin: “We’re teaching our kids to be a part of something bigger than themselves.”",
"On a daily basis, news organizations are calling out facts versus lies told by people on different sides of controversial issues. And our social media feeds are likely flooded with real news and misinformation that look exactly alike.So what exactly is the truth? That’s hard for adults to answer—and even harder for kids to understand. An experiment conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that adults believed false “news” reports about 20 percent of the time. And a poll by Common Sense Media found that less than half of kids surveyed said they could tell fake stories from real ones.It’s challenging for kids to make sense of today’s confusing media environment when adults themselves struggle to understand it. The following tips from the new Nat Geo book Breaking the News offers simple steps kids can follow to tell the difference between authentic news and misinformation. They’ll help encourage children to think independently and become responsible digital citizens—so kids are not only responsible for themselves, but also for what they share with others.Stop before you click. Studies show that people are much more likely to click on a headline or share a post if it makes them feel happy, angry, or excited. This is especially true among young people, who are some of the most likely to read clickbait. And yet the most provocative headlines often turn out to be the most misleading.The best advice for kids and adults is that when we feel a strong, knee-jerk reaction, resist the urge to share the post immediately. Stop, breathe, and think about what’s making you feel that way. Is it a shocking headline or image? Does the language make wild statements without any facts to back it up? These are telltale signs that the post may be fake.And because headlines can be deceiving, kids should remember to read the whole article or post before sharing.Go to the source. Children might not be glued to the daily news, but they’ve probably absorbed some conflicting information. If your child feels confused—and who wouldn’t?—encourage him to ask the one question that will lead to the truth: What’s the source of the information?Authentic news will include sources for all information presented. (If anonymous sources are used, the story should explain why the person’s name is withheld.) Explain that a reliable news story will provide sources for different sides of an issue, then work together to identify the sources in the story; looking for names of the people quoted as well as the organizations that provide the facts and figures.And if sources aren’t provided? That’s a major red flag that the news report isn’t legitimate.Fact-check suspicious stories. Young people don’t always know not to believe everything they read. Here are a few easy tricks that kids can use to tell if a far-fetched story could be a hoax, a wild conspiracy theory, or misinformation.Know how to spot propaganda. Throughout history, propaganda has followed a tried-and-true formula that’s surprisingly simple yet remarkably effective—and at times, very destructive. See if your child can identify any of these common propaganda techniques used by people or organizations covered in the news.Fess up if you make a mistake. One survey found that about a third of kids who shared a story later found out it was fake or inaccurate. If your child accidentally shares a false story, he doesn’t need to be embarrassed. After all, adults (and maybe you) have done this, too! But the responsible action is to try to stop the spread of false information by posting a note that explains that the post turned out to be fake. Your child can also encourage his friends to do the same if they’ve shared it with others.ROBIN TERRY BROWN is the author of Breaking the News: What’s Real, What’s Not, and Why the Difference Matters. After a 17-year career as a senior editor with National Geographic, Terry Brown now works as a writer, editor, and truth-seeker.",
"When Salt Lake City schools closed in March, Farah Hamoodi, a health promotion specialist at a global nonprofit, wasn’t sure how to manage her kids’ tech time when classrooms went virtual.Her five-year-old wasn't engaging with her preschool videos, and her 13-year-old struggled with time management. When her eldest started spending a lot of time on social media and experiencing headaches and eye problems, Hamoodi decided to set limits on her phone and computer use. “I want her to spend time doing other things,” she says. “But there are also good things about being online,” like developing new computer skills and socializing with friends.Hamoodi is one of millions of parents grappling with how to balance their children’s increase in digital usage with their physical and mental well-being. This fall, about 60 percent of K-12 public school students in the United States will be attending school remotely, and as classrooms move online and extracurriculars are on hold, experts agree kids are spending more time on screens. But increased technology use isn’t inherently good or bad.“If we’re only concerned about screen time, in some ways we’re concerned about the wrong thing,” says Michael Rich, founder and director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children’s Hospital. "Our research in the past has shown that it’s not about how many hours you’re on a screen that matters—what matters is what you’re on the screen for.”Media use becomes unhealthy when it starts replacing important things like physical activity, spending time with friends and family, and sleep. “If you’re on-screen playing NBA 2K instead of out in the backyard shooting hoops with your brother, there’s a difference in that,” explains Rich, who helped produce a digital wellness guide for families.Here are some ways parents can foster healthy tech habits.Kids are reporting more physical side effects from increased tech time, including eye strain, neck and back pain, headaches, and carpal tunnel. That's because they’re often sitting in static positions with poor posture, and staring at screens without blinking for extended periods, says Karen Jacobs, an occupational therapist and associate dean for Digital Learning and Innovation at Boston University's Sargent College.Jacobs recommends setting up a “home base” for virtual learning in a low-traffic area. If multiple people are working in the same space, try using a three-panel cardboard display to create physical barriers between them. Implement a simple color-coded system to set boundaries—putting out a green card means it’s OK to come in, yellow means come in but be quiet, and red means don’t distract me.The workspace should be well-lit, and children should have a flat surface to work on. Using a child-size desk and chair can help with posture, or you can adapt adult chairs by propping up their feet with a stool and adding pillows for back support. It’s also OK to move around between chairs, couches, and beanbags—the key is to make sure it’s comfortable, and the child’s back and feet are supported, Jacobs says.When setting up screens, have your child sit with their back against the chair, and place their device an arm’s length away (fist closed) and slightly below eye level. Smaller tablets and phone screens can be hard on the eyes, so connecting to a larger monitor can help.Remember to take frequent breaks, Jacobs says. Kids should follow the 20-20-20 rule to rest their eyes: Look 20 feet away every 20 minutes for at least 20 seconds. Make it fun for younger children by playing “I Spy” and having them look for something outside the window. Ideally, kids should get out of their chairs and stretch every 20 minutes, or as frequently as their school schedule allows. Nature can also enhance mood and learning, so encourage outdoor breaks when feasible or bring natural elements, like plants, into the workspace.Finally, keyboards and touch screens can harbor harmful bacteria, so disinfect surfaces regularly and promote healthy hand-washing. If a child is complaining about musculoskeletal pain or eye problems, talk to their pediatrician. Many schools employ occupational therapy practitioners who are using telehealth tools to evaluate kids’ workstations, Jacobs says. Ask the school if these resources are available.On top of physical symptoms, screen time can take a mental and emotional toll. “We have some data that suggests being on Zoom all the time is more exhausting than face-to-face interactions,” says Christine Elgersma, senior editor of social media and learning resources at Common Sense Media. (‘Zoom fatigue’ is taxing the brain. Here’s why that happens.)Teachers and parents are still learning how to navigate these challenges. While having face time and making eye contact with teachers and peers is ideal, Elgersma believes kids shouldn’t be forced to turn on their cameras. From an equity standpoint, she says, they might be sharing a workspace or not want classmates to see their home, and adds that seeing their own faces during video calls can add another complex layer of self-scrutiny, especially for teens and tweens. If a child is uncomfortable video conferencing, Elgersma recommends that the parent speak directly with the teacher.If parents are concerned that turning off the camera will hurt their kids’ social skills, Elgersma says to focus on the bigger picture. “For little kids, hopefully they’re getting supplemental in-person time with family members so that they still have interactions, but for older kids who already have some social skills in place, the school Zoom setting isn’t necessarily a make-or-break situation for their social development.” Encourage them to stay engaged in classes by using alternative tools, such as the chat function. And if parents are available, they can “peek in” occasionally to make sure kids are on task when a teacher can’t see them. (Help your child become the virtual host with the most.)And if kids are having trouble focusing on virtual lessons—whether they’re using video or not—screen-free breaks and physical activity can help kids recharge, Elgersma says. When kids are in a classroom, constant stimuli keep them on their toes, but if they’re alone in a bedroom, it’s easy to zone out. One thing that could help is using some sensory behavior techniques. For instance, limited research suggests that fidget toys can actually help kids stay focused on cognitive tasks. Something as simple as a sock filled with other socks that they can squeeze can give them that sensory input.” (Here are some other sensory input tricks to settle your child.)Above all, Elgersma reminds parents to stay flexible and communicate. Give feedback to teachers and schools—with lots of empathy—about what is and isn't working for your child.Help kids manage schoolwork, sleep, exercise, and socializing by sticking to a schedule—and that includes setting boundaries on recreational screen time. Remember that quality is more important than quantity. Kids who are separated from friends during the pandemic may need extra time for video chatting, or want to watch online tutorials to replace in-person extracurricular activities. “Rather than make it about policing, make it about supporting them in their success,” Rich says. (Here's why parents don't need to be that concerned about too much tech time.)Give children clear stop times for screen use. Blue light from devices can interrupt our normal circadian rhythms and throw off sleep and wake schedules. Rich recommends setting a regular bedtime, making sure screens are off an hour before that, and charging devices outside of kids’ bedrooms overnight.It's also important for parents to model healthy behavior, says Megan Moreno, principal investigator of the Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For example, a parent might say, “I’m going to put my phone in this drawer and spend time with you” or “It’s family movie night, let’s put our phones away.” Parents can also implement screen-free mealtimes and talk about their day. These simple statements send powerful messages to kids. (The kids may not be all right. Here’s how to check in on their mental health.)While it’s normal for kids to be spending more time on their devices, excessive media use can negatively impact their physical and mental health. “A lot of those worrisome signs haven’t changed with COVID,” Moreno says. If your child is withdrawing from friends, refusing to leave their video games for family time, or staying up all night and not waking up for school, these can be signs that they’re over-enmeshed in digital spaces.If media use is interfering with a child’s daily functioning, parents should talk to their pediatrician or therapist, and can read more about Problematic Interactive Media Use.Ultimately, Rich wants parents to stay positive and trust their instincts.“I would encourage parents not to feel guilty and also keep their sense of humor,” he says. “[Technology] is not something for us to get anxious and stressed about so much as to actually venture into this brave new world with our children.”",
"Britt Goodenow figured she had virtual playdating nailed when her sons joined a video Dungeons and Dragons game. The Takoma Park, Maryland, mom figured it’d be the perfect activity to keep her kids occupied while she and her husband got some work done.Then the screen crackled, and the rolling-dice website went down. One boy started crying, saying that not being able to play was ruining his day. Then everyone started yelling advice—all at once.“It was complete chaos for close to a half hour,” Goodenow says. “Eventually everyone just gave up and signed off.”Tears might be the extreme when it comes to virtual playdates, but almost any parent who’s tried this solution to keep their kid social is familiar with that awkward silence when kids just stare at each other across the screen.Although states are cautiously reopening, many parents are still hesitant about face-to-face interactions, especially when it comes to their children. But even in these socially distant times, kids still need to be social. “They need to learn how to coexist,” says Sarah Kanter, an elementary school counselor in Montgomery County, Maryland. “They need to learn how to regulate their emotions, how to solve problems and build resiliency.”As parents know all too well, virtual playdates just aren’t the same as the real thing. When kids play together in real life they use non-verbal clues to communicate, such as silently collaborating on building with Legos or playing catch. Video chats reduce that interaction to only what’s on the screen. (Learn the science beind "Zoom fatigue.")“Our daughter would run off to get something to show her friend during the video chat but forget to take the phone with her,” says Heather Bachor of Shokan, New York. “Her friend would be left hanging with a good view of the ceiling.”But it is possible to have a successful virtual playdate—parents just need to follow their kid’s communication style and have a few activity suggestions for kids to try because maintaining relationships and being social is especially important now."This is obviously a very stressful, highly charged, emotional time for everyone, including children,” Kanter says. “I think it helps to normalize their experience to be able to interact, connect, and share.”Often the awkwardness of a virtual playdate has a lot to do with the personality of the child.For instance, quieter kids might not take naturally to making conversation on camera, which can cause anxiety. “They don’t want any part of it,” Kanter says. “Unfortunately, this is the only option right now.” She suggests parents start with short playdates with the camera turned off, then work up to longer, more interactive ones. And always follow a child’s lead—never force them to interact if it’s truly upsetting to them.Even children who are comfortable with online gatherings can struggle without structure. Kid-led birthday parties can quickly spiral out of control, with everyone yelling at once and trying to take over the screen.Even though it can be chaotic and feel forced, parents should keep encouraging kids to try to socialize virtually. “I think you really need to emphasize that this is temporary," Kanter says.The key to a successful virtual playdate? Having a game plan. Developing conversation starters provides focus and helps shy kids feel more comfortable. Then parents can let the kids take the meetup in whatever direction they want. Here are a few ideas to get them started.—Write silly stories: Have kids take turns creating fill-in-the-blank stories. Bonus: They’ll practice writing, reading, and grammar.—Show and tell: Each kid takes turns showing each other their toys. “My six-year-old daughter Emily and her friend show each other their American Girl dolls and play with them together virtually,” says Jana Manu of New York City.— Collaborate on newspapers: Kids understand they're living in unusual times. Encourage them to document it together. The kid reporters can collaborate and share ideas during video chats; they can write about their own experiences, what's going in their neighborhood, or what’s happening internationally. The paper can include cartoons, poems, photos, and games. (Get inspiration from these kids.)—Play music together: Grab an instrument and let the music flow. Bachor says daughter Philanthe plays duets with her friend. “Her friend is a great piano player, so Philanthe got out her violin, and they played back and forth to each other,” she says. “It was really cute.” (No instrument? No problem. Have kids make their own guitars.)—Create a cooking show: Agree on a recipe in advance, then have the kids follow it together and narrate the steps, just like on a real show.—Room tours: We’re all getting sneak peeks into each other’s homes these days. Let kids give a virtual tour of their rooms.—Lessons: Know kids who can braid? Fold paper airplanes? Make friendship bracelets? Do TikTok dances? Invite them to teach each other.—Talent show: This works well for a small group. Nominate a master of ceremonies to introduce the performers who take turns playing music, telling jokes, doing tongue twisters, performing magic tricks, or showing off other special talents.—Hide and seek: This might not sound like an IRL game that can go virtual, but Takoma Park, Maryland, mom Marisa Taylor was impressed that her 10-year-old daughter, Zola, pulled it off. After showing each other around their houses, one friend covered the camera and hid, then uncovered the camera. “The kid who was ‘It’ had to guess where the friend was in the house by seeing only her face on camera,” Taylor says. “They found this pretty funny.”—What am I? Hold up a small image or household object super close to the camera, then have the other friend try to guess what it is. Get inspiration from this video series.—Mystery sounds: Anything that makes noise can work for this one, as long as it remains off camera. Try bouncing a ball, flipping through a book, cutting paper, or squishing slime.—Board games: Some games work better than others, and both players need to have their own version. Gina Bruns of Tokyo, Japan, says her seven-year-old son, Jackson, has played Battleship, Guess Who?, and Monopoly Jr. “The games take much longer to play than I would have thought because they simply become the backdrop for talking,” she says. “But it enables the kids to stay focused and in one location.”—Or just let the kids run with it. Jennifer Knowlton of Silver Spring, Maryland, overheard her nine-year-old son on a call with his cousin doing nothing but making ridiculous noises. Her first instinct was to explain the importance of being a good conversationalist, but then she realized that they needed this time to be silly like they would be at school. “I stepped back and thought, I don’t want to give him any suggestions whatsoever,” she says. “I want this to be whatever it is for him. And if it’s just him making faces at someone on FaceTime or Zoom, then that’s what he needs right now.”",
"Aromatic plant and flower extracts and oils have been used to promote kids’ mental and physical health for thousands of years. In ancient India, oils were used during Ayurvedic baby massages to promote growth and wellness. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners added them to carefully concocted herbal remedies to treat childhood illnesses. And Egyptian families used them in cooking to help with digestion, and even applied warm, oil-soaked papyrus over a child’s stomach to help with urinary issues.Today, Americans spend more than $30.2 billion annually on out-of-pocket complementary health approaches, according to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. That includes aromatherapy, or the use of essential oils made from natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being.“Aromatherapy has been around for centuries, but we’re just really now beginning to understand that it does have therapeutic benefits,” says physician Scott Schwantes, director of the pediatric pain program within the department of Pediatric Pain, Palliative and Integrative Medicine at Children’s Minnesota. And although most of the scientific research has focused on adults, more and more parents are discovering that kids might benefit from aromatherapy, too.“There’s so much benefit our kids can get from nonpharmacologic approaches,” Schwantes says. “And smell really is unique amongst all of our senses—there is a special connection between emotions, memories, and smells.”Much has been made about supporting kids’ mental health and wellness after the stress of the pandemic, but experts agree that adding aromatherapy to a child’s routine can have powerfully positive effects on kids’ bodies and moods. (Still, Schwantes stresses that it’s not a replacement for medical care.)“Aromatherapy is a wonderful, accessible experience that families can engage in that really just helps kids out,” he says. “It can also just be for the maintenance of health and well-being—and there’s a lot of power in that as well.”Here’s how parents can safely incorporate aromatherapy into everyday activities to promote wellness in their children—and some fun DIY crafts to help.Humans have relied on their noses for thousands of years to aid survival. Within the first few days of life, infants show a preference for the smell of their own mother and her milk. Our sense of smell helps us identify nutritious or spoiled food, alerts us to dangerous smells, and even plays a role in mate selection. Scientists believe the human nose can detect upward of one trillion smells, and something as seemingly simple as the smell of chocolate involves some 600 odor molecules.Kids have an especially keen sense of smell—it matures as they grow, peaks in early childhood, and then gradually declines throughout adulthood. In fact, compared to sights and sounds, smell triggers our earliest and most emotionally powerful childhood memories.Senses like sound, touch, and sight travel complex pathways to reach the brain. But what makes smell so unique, Schwantes says, is that when a scent molecule enters the nose, it goes to the brain’s olfactory bulb, where signals are transmitted directly to the limbic system. That houses structures like the amygdala and hippocampus, the brain areas associated with emotion and memory.The research behind why aromatherapy seems to promote well-being is still limited. But experts cite a couple popular scientific theories on why smells affect the body and brain.The “pharmacological hypothesis” asserts that odors directly interact with the autonomic and central nervous systems, which regulate everything from heart rate and digestion to speech and memory. For example, studies of lavender have been shown to affect the activity of cyclic andenosine monophosphate, a biochemical messenger in the body’s cells that can be associated with sedation.Then there’s the “psychological hypothesis,” which you might recognize if the smell of baking pie or roasting chicken has ever blissfully transported you back to your grandparents’ house. This theory suggests that our response to smells is learned. In other words, we associate smells with emotional experiences, and eventually, those smells will evoke pleasant or unpleasant emotions tied to that experience. For example, one study showed that people who were exposed to pleasant smells, like baking cookies or roasting coffee, were more likely to help a stranger. Another study found that people exposed to an unpleasant odor had a lower tolerance for frustration.Empirical evidence is still limited, but several scents in particular seem to promote well-being in children, says Vanessa Battista, a nurse practitioner with the Neuromuscular Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Lavender is a calming scent and can be used both to calm nervous anxiety as well as physically calming a rash or irritation. Mandarin and sweet orange are invigorating scents that can be used as a pick-me-up when kids are feeling tired or unfocused; they can also be used to help with relaxation. (Schwantes adds that lemon is another scent that can help with focus and fatigue.) Peppermint can be used for headaches and nausea.While aromatherapy is generally safe for children, experts caution that essential oils are not regulated by the FDA. So Battista recommends that bottles be locked away from young children. Schwantes adds that he doesn’t recommend using essential oils with infants, simply because human scent plays a crucial role in parent-child bonding.Lisa Squires, an integrative health program nurse coordinator at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, recommends that parents should dilute the oils based on a child’s age and weight, then start with a 24-hour patch test to make sure the kid doesn’t have an adverse reaction. Children should never ingest the oils.Parents should also strive to minimize the environmental impact of aromatherapy, since essential oil production can mean high carbon emissions from transportation, energy use to power greenhouses, water-intensive distillation methods, potential chemical runoff from farming, and overharvesting. Reduce your footprint by making your oils last longer to prevent waste—store bottles in a dry place away from sunlight to prevent oxidation, and screw caps on tightly to reduce evaporation.“Aromatherapy can be really fun, but not all children will appreciate it,” Battista says. “[Kids with] very sensitive senses of smell and taste and touch can become easily overwhelmed by these scents,” so start small to see what kids like. (Squires says lavender and mandarin are good beginner scents.)These crafty ideas can get you started—just reapply the oils every few days based on your child’s scent preference.Want kids to calm down (or sleep?) Make this lavender-scented sock buddy.• Grab an old pair of crew socks.• Stuff about two-thirds of the foot portion with cotton or cloth scraps to form the “body,” and tie it in place with a piece of yarn.• Stuff the remaining third of the foot portion and tie it with another piece of yarn to create the head.• Cut the remaining top of the sock down the middle, stopping at the top of the head, to form floppy bunny ears.• Decorate your bunny with fabric markers.• Dab on some lavender oil so kids can give it a squeeze or keep it on their nightstand.Want kids to focus or relax? Make this mandarin-scented ‘dough.’• In a saucepan, combine 1 cup flour, 1 cup warm water, 1/3 cup salt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1.5 teaspoons tartar, and a few drops of food coloring (optional).• Heat on medium-low until it thickens, then remove from heat and let it cool.• Knead a few drops of mandarin essential oil into the dough until it’s smooth.• Seal it for freshness. Also, it might smell good enough to eat, so remind kids that it’s not food!(Bonus: Manipulating dough with their hands is a great sensory activity that helps kids get out excess energy and improve concentration. Here are more sensory crafts to try.)Want to help a kid’s stress headache? Make some peppermint puffy paint.• In a bowl, combine about 3/8 cup white glue, 3/4 cup unscented shaving cream, a few drops of food coloring, and peppermint essential oil.• Add 1/4 cup flour and mix well.• Pour the puffy paint into plastic squeeze bottles, or spoon it into a plastic baggie and snip off the corner off.Want to get the benefits without the crafts? Improvise!Swhwantes says aromatherapy can be as simple as putting a couple dabs of oil on a cotton ball and placing it near the child, or dipping the end of a hoodie string in oil so a kid can wear the scent all day.“Not everybody has access to a massage therapist or an acupuncturist,” he says. “But just about anybody can get access to good essential oils.”",
"Early childhood educator Amanda Ralph still remembers a preschooler who, when he got really frustrated, would throw things. “I’d direct him to the Play-Doh area,” says Ralph, who’s based in Surrey, England. “You can really mess with it and destroy it. It’s something you can use to take out that urge.”Soon other revved-up kids were flocking to the Play-Doh station to depressurize. It was so effective that Ralph started mixing up her own clays and other squashable substances, and even wrote a book about them: Creative Sensory Play Recipe Toolkit.Children have a lot going on in those little brains of theirs, and things like uncertainty and sudden change can lead to frustration and stress. We all need a way to depressurize—and for kids, it might come in the form of slime.Sensory input—the info we receive through our senses so we can learn about the environment—sends messages to the nervous system. (Learn here how sensory input can help your child focus at home.) For instance, negative input like the sound of a scream can push kids into a fight-or-flight response.But positive or enjoyable sensory input can do the opposite. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is in charge of rest and conserving physical energy. As pediatric neuropsychologist Marie Briody of Healthcare Associates in Medicine on Staten Island puts it, “Positive sensory input is activating more of the parasympathetic nervous system so we feel that we’re OK.”While all the senses can promote relaxation, the sense of touch might be a route to a meditative state.“There’s something about different tactile things that actually creates a sense of mindfulness,” says Tracy Turner-Bumberry, a licensed professional counselor and play therapist in Milledgeville, Georgia. “It helps children hone in on what’s happening right now and tune out past sadness or future anxiety. They notice that right in that moment, they’re touching something that feels so good in their hands.”Ralph adds that when kids are using sensory manipulatives, “the brain switches off. There’s no right or wrong way, so it doesn’t feel stressed.”Plus, toying with sensory squishies, mushies, and gooshies can build cognitive skills and may even help kids with their penmanship. “Children’s hands aren’t fully developed until they're about six or seven,” Ralph says. “So by using manipulative materials, it’s actually strengthening the hands and giving them strength for a pencil grip.”Not all sensations feel good to all kids, and you may need to try more than one of these squishy recipes.Ralph suggests letting more sensitive kids explore and touch each ingredient before mixing it in. Turner-Bumberry, author of 2, 4, 6, 8, This is How We Regulate!: 75 Play Therapy Activities to Increase Mindfulness in Children, recommends a ‘one-finger touch.’ “One finger is less stressful,” she says, “while a whole handful might be overwhelming.”And feel free to get your hands in them as well. “They may help you decouple from stress,” Ralph says.Just mix 8 parts flour with 1 part oil to create a fluffy substance.

"Salt Lake City mom Christina Lau Billings has her 11-year-old all set up for distance learning with a quiet space, a desk, and … a yoga ball.“When he doesn’t have to be on camera during a Zoom class, sometimes he’ll switch to the yoga ball and bounce for a bit,” she says. “I think it’s very helpful in having him be able to focus on his online classes.” Similarly, over in Stamford, Connecticut, teacher Jessica Gerson remembers students who’d improve their focus by squeezing DIY flour-filled balloons during class.Lau Billings and Gerson are using what occupational therapists and neuropsychologists call a “sensory diet.” It’s a collection of feel-good sensory input, which are techniques that use a child’s senses to help with emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Therapists often turn to the sensory diet when developing a child’s ability to calm themselves and focus—something many kids are struggling with now.“Children have had so many changes in their routine—school, mask wearing, a decrease in seeing friends,” says Tracy Turner-Bumberry, a licensed professional counselor and play therapist in Milledgeville, Georgia. Add in distance-learning stressors—an Internet connection that suddenly drops, or just noise from sibs or parents—and “children may be on sensory overload,” Turner-Bumberry explains. “This leads to meltdowns, aggression, crying, and more. Providing an individualized, calming, sensory diet can help kids calm this overload and self-regulate.”As Lau Billings and Gerson found, the right sensory input can make a big difference in helping kids focus to get their work done—even when the teacher isn’t physically there. The trick is finding the right exercise for your child’s particular distracting behavior. Here’s how to figure that out.We all use sensory input every day to help us understand and interact with the world. “We take in information through our senses, and that tells us about the environment,” says Marie Briody, a pediatric neuropsychologist with Healthcare Associates in Medicine on Staten Island. This input is picked up by our bodies’ sensory systems—auditory (sound), visual (sight), oral (taste and texture), olfactory (smell), tactile (touch), proprioceptive (muscle and joint awareness), and vestibular (motion). From there the sensory input goes to the brain, which interprets everything as messages.Those messages can be warnings, like when an ambulance screams past or a pungent smell wafts by. “The sympathetic nervous system, which is our fight-or-flight response, makes hormones like adrenaline course through our bodies,” Briody says. “That feels uncomfortable because our heart rate changes, our respiration changes.”But with different kinds of sensory input, the opposite can happen. Enjoyable sensory input—listening to a gurgling stream or petting a soft dog, for instance—can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which commands resting conditions and helps to conserve energy. In other words, it helps people stay calm.Scientists aren't sure exactly why positive sensory input works so well for children. Some studies suggest that it might lead to microscopic brain changes in the frontal limbic system, where emotional learning and memory are still developing in kids.“We are honestly just scratching the surface of really understanding this stuff,” says Steven B. Schwartzberg, a pediatric neurologist at Healthcare Associates in Medicine on Staten Island. “But therapists will attest that it really does work for many children.”Using some of these techniques before your child sits down to work—or even when they’re anxious or frustrated—can make a big difference. Yet not every technique works for every kid.“Every child’s brain is wired differently,” says Los Angeles occupational therapist Judy Tran. “That’s why I’m always asking parents to look for patterns as to what their child is drawn to naturally.”The goal, she says, is to find the “just-right state.” Check out the ideas below to help your child deal with some of the most common unfocused behavior.Sensory trick: Clasping hands and pushing or pulling them apart, pulling resistance bands, pushing feet against a stable object, bear hugs Why it works: These exercises all provide “proprioceptive input,” which affect sensory receptors in muscles and joints. To give a visual, “I tell kids to pretend to ‘squeeze an orange in between their hands to make orange juice,’” Tran says. These techniques fatigue the muscles and therefore provide a sense of calm. “They help children feel more grounded and settled,” she adds.Sensory trick: Slowly turning in a desk chair, sitting, gently bouncing or rocking on a yoga ball, hanging upside-down (such as hanging the head off the edge of the sofa) Why it works: These activities focus on the vestibular system, which gives us our sense of motion. It’s stimulated by the movement of fluid within the inner ear, which moves whenever kids rock, spin, make crazy movements, or go upside-down.“In general, slower movement is more calming,” Tran says. She adds that these activities also help kids expend energy and release tension—and the calming effect may last up to eight hours.Sensory trick: Putting on a ball cap or hoodie, wearing lightly tinted sunglasses, reducing screen brightness, using more natural light Why it works: This child might be getting too much visual input—and online classes might be making things worse. “They might put both hands over their eyebrows, shielding to focus down,” Tran says. “Or you might see a child putting their head down on the side so that their eyes are closer to the paper.”Lowering brightness, tidying up, or even removing distracting decorations from the study spot can help reduce visual stimulation. “There's a reason why removing clutter helps you to focus,” Tran says. If you don’t have time for a major cleanup, Tran suggests a quick fix: throwing a solid-colored sheet over everything while the kids are studying.Sensory trick: Snacking on chewy foods like gummies or crunchy foods like nuts, apples, or carrots; sipping from a straw; eating sour or spicy flavors Why it works: “Imagine you’re eating a meal and all you get is purées,” Tran says. “Then all of a sudden, you get a crunchy carrot or a crisp pretzel.” That new sensation will snap you to attention. “These kids are looking for extra stimulation to the muscles of the mouth,” she says. Once they receive it, they can focus.Sensory trick: Moving to a quiet room, putting on noise-canceling headphones, listening to quiet music Why it works: These children are extra sensitive to auditory input and might be partially covering their ears with their hands, or humming or singing to themselves over other noise in their immediate environment. “They may be trying to help themselves focus,” Tran says. “These things all reduce auditory input so they can attend to their work.”",
"Kids who doodle, finger paint, or design bead jewelry aren’t just making art—they’re boosting their brainpower.Making a masterpiece—or just a stick-figure drawing—is actually a problem-solving project for kids: First a child looks at the materials and decides what they want to make and how they’ll make it. Then they’ll engage motor skills by manipulating tools to make and adjust their art until they’re happy with their creation … or not. (Dealing with disappointment is good life practice too.)Creating art can even make your child a kinder friend. Neurologists have found that creating art at least once a week can increase introspection and empathy because the act strengthens the brain’s default mode network, regions that are active when thinking about others and your own actions. Art can also help kids be kinder to themselves. In one study, professor Girija Kaimal of Drexel University and the president-elect of the American Art Therapy Association, discovered that creating art for 45 minutes had a significant reduction in cortisol, the main stress chemical in our bodies.Making original art instead of, say, coloring in a coloring book might have benefits as well. Studies have shown that free drawing keeps people more focused on the activity than directed art, and significantly improves creative thinking skills. “Improvisation totally lights up the brain,” Kaimal says.Not sure where to start? Give your kids one of these DIY art projects with ingredients you probably have at home.What you’ll need:• Mixing bowl• Baking soda• Vinegar (white vinegar, rice vinegar, or another type without color)• Light corn syrup• Corn starch• Muffin tin or ice-cube tray• Food coloring• Spoon• Water• Paint brushWhat to do:—In a bowl, have your kids mix 4 tablespoons of baking soda with 4 tablespoons of vinegar and wait for the fizzing to stop.—Ask them to stir in ½ teaspoon of corn syrup and 2 tablespoons of corn starch.—Evenly distribute the mixture in your muffin tin or ice-cube tray.—Add one drop of food coloring to each compartment and mix with a spoon.Your kids can wait for the mixture to dry overnight like a regular watercolor palette and then use water to moisten their brushes, or they can start painting immediately.What you’ll need:• Paper• Different sizes of bowls and cups• Pens, markers, colored pencils, or crayonsWhat to do:—Gather bowls for your kids to use. On a piece of paper, place the biggest bowl face down and have your kids trace around it with a pen or marker, making a big circle.—Repeat this step with the second-biggest bowl, tracing it inside the first circle. Repeat this process using smaller and smaller bowls and cups.—Have your kids create different patterns in the space between the circles, like repeating triangles, flower petals, circles, and dots.—Color in the shapes using crayons or colored pencils.What you’ll need:• Colorful pages from old magazines• Scissors• Glue stick• Pencil• Thread• Clear nail polishWhat to do:—Have your kids tear out a colorful page from an old magazine.—Help them cut the page into long triangular strips: Start cutting from the top left corner across the page’s width at a slight downward angle. Then cut in the other direction, also at slight downward angle. (Wider strips make wider beads.)—Lay a pencil on the wide edge of the triangle strip, and then have your kids roll the pencil one time around the strip.—Use your glue stick to place a thin layer of glue on rest of the strip before rolling it completely around the pencil.—Slide the rolled-up paper off of your pencil; wait for the glue to dry.—Paint a layer of clear nail polish on the outside of the bead.—Have your kids string the paper beads onto thread to make a bracelet or necklace.What you’ll need:• Mixing bowl• Corn starch• Food coloring• Muffin tin or ice-cube tray• Water• Foam brushesWhat to do:—In a bowl, mix equal parts water and cornstarch and stir until combined.—Equally distribute the mixture in your muffin tin.—Add one drop of food coloring to each cup.—Have your kids dip their foam brushes into the mixture and paint the sidewalk.(Check out this article about making animal tracks with sidewalk chalk.)What you’ll need:• Two big pots• Water• White vinegar• Salt• Food scraps or spices (for pinkish-red use beets, cherries, or purple cabbage; for yellow use turmeric or paprika; for pinkish-blue use concord grapes; for very light pink use avocado skins and pits)• Strainer• Rubber bands• White cotton fabric to tie dyeWhat to do:—Place your fabric into a big pot with either water and salt (about eight cups of water to ½ cup salt for a fruit dye) or water and vinegar (about one part vinegar to four parts water for a vegetable dye). Supervise while the fabric boils for one hour, then briefly rinse with cold water.—While the fabric is boiling, help kids chop the food items or gather about a half cup of your spices and place them in another pot. Fill with enough water to cover the scraps or spices with a few inches of water.—Under supervision, bring scraps and water to a boil. Simmer for one hour, and remove the dye from the heat. Strain, then discard the scraps into the compost. (Or eat the beets!)—Have your kids arrange their fabric items into funky patterns, like a twisted spiral or a scrunched-up ball. They can place rubber bands around it to secure the shape.—Place the rubber-banded fabric into your saucepan and leave it until the color is about a shade darker than you’d like your shirt to be, usually for about an hour.—Remove the rubber bands.—Heat-set the color by microwaving your fabric for 2 minutes, then let it cool.— Wash the fabric in cold water and dry on high heat.",
"Life skill: Environmental stewardshipStep 1: Make an animal track stencil.—Have kids choose an animal that they want other people to know about. It could be an endangered animal from a faraway country or one that lives in your neighborhood.—Look online to find the shape of the animal’s footprint.—Print a copy of the footprint at the size you want.—Cut out each part of the print (for instance, the heel, four toes, and four claws) to make a pattern for the stencil.—On a file folder or cardstock, arrange the cutouts back into the shape of the paw. Trace around the cutouts.—Poke a small starter hole in the center of each section.—Slide one side of the scissors into the hole and cut to the track’s edge. Then cut out each section along the outline.Step 2: Make washable liquid chalk.—In a small container, mix:• 1 cup corn starch• 1 cup water—Divide the mixture into different containers.—Add about 4 to 6 drops of food coloring to each container to make a variety of chalk colors.—Paint or drip a few drops onto the cement to test the color, then let it dry. (The chalk should darken as it dries.) If it’s not colorful enough, add a couple more drops of food coloring.Step 3: Create the tracks.(Have kids practice on cement that’s out of view. This way they can get a feel for their technique and the amount of paint needed.)—Choose a dry sidewalk or paved path. Brush off excess leaves and dirt from the cement.—Hold the stencil onto the cement with one hand.—Stir the liquid chalk if the cornstarch has settled, then dip in the paintbrush. Wipe off the excess paint on the side of the container. (If the brush is too wet, the paint will seep underneath the stencil.)—Dab the brush into each cut-out portion of the stencil until the entire shape is filled in with paint.—Move the stencil based on where the animal’s other paws would be, and repeat the stencil process.—Keep going! Your child can decide how far the animal “walks.”—Write the animal’s name near the tracks.• Make stencils that show left, right, front, and hind feet.• Create tracks based on the animal’s wild behavior: Should rabbit tracks zig zag as if it’s escaping a predator? Should tiger tracks appear as if it’s leaping or walking?• For more realistic tracks, measure out the animal’s gait on the sidewalk.• Make signs to share information about the animal and its tracks. (Learn how to build a nature trail.)• Create insect or bird tracks. (Check out this article about backyard safaris to get ideas.)• Have tracks cross paths.• Make stamps. Trace the tracks onto a clean kitchen sponge with a marker, and cut them out. Use a glue gun to attach the sponge pieces onto cardboard. (Adults should help younger children with this.) Dip the stamp into liquid chalk to make the tracks.",
"Life skill: ExplorationStep 1: Collect the information.—Have kids walk around yard, making a list of animals they find. (Check out this article about doing a backyard safari.) Some ideas:• Look up to find squirrels and birds.• Peek under rocks to find snails.• Peer into the flowers and bushes to find butterflies and bumblebees.• Check in between blades of grass and on branches for ladybugs, stick insects, and other tiny critters.• Sweep the dirt to find roly-pollies.• Remind kids to use their senses to listen for birds or sniff out flowers that might attract insects.—Have kids add details to their list. For instance:• What was the animal doing?• Where was it?• How many were there?Step 2: Map out the trail.—Pick out the best “wildlife habitats” on the list, the places in the yard where the most interesting action is happening. (Kids might want to start small, with four or five habitats.)—Decide the order of how you’d want these habitats to appear on the nature trail, including the start and end point.—Sketch your yard on paper, noting trees, bushes, furniture, garden hoses, doghouse, swing sets, etc.—Mark the entrance and habitats on the map with a symbol like a star or heart—stickers work great! (Here’s an article on kid-friendly map-making.)—Write down the name of your trail at the entrance, and give each habitat a fun name, like Ladybug Lookout.—Connect the entrance and habitats with a colored pencil.Step 3: Mark the trail—Create signs for the entrance and each habitat.—Use tips and questions from the Camp Logo activity to name the trail and design the entrance sign. (Be sure to include your camp logo on the entrance!)—Let kids get creative for the habitat signs, but consider including:• The habitat name• A drawing or photo of the animal one might observe in the habitat• Details about what to look for• Fun facts about the animal—Glue the sign to an equal-size piece of cardboard, posterboard, or cardstock.—Slide each sign into a clear, resealable plastic bag so that the top of the sign is at the bottom, then seal it.• Tape or staple the sign to a wooden garden stake. (Or get creative with other “stakes”: old rulers, taped-together straws, etc.)• Stick the signs into the ground near each habitat.Have kids lead family campers on the new nature trail. Uber-explorers can expand the trail into your neighborhood sidewalks. (Just make sure to get people’s permission if, say, a sidewalk tree is part of their property.)",
"To a kid, a backyard is a place to play. But they might be surprised at how many critters they’re sharing their play space with.Entomologists (otherwise known as bug scientists) conduct something called a bioblitz to get a general count of how many bugs live in an area. They turn over rocks, peer under logs, and pull bits off trees to check out the number of critters in a place. Children can try something similar using observation skills and—yes!—math; the activity also helps foster exploration.“Spending time in nature and specifically looking for insects or other creatures as part of a bioblitz activity can expose children to the amazing diversity of life around us,” says entomologist Patrick Liesch of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It can also teach about the life cycles and ecological roles of these creatures.”Luckily a bioblitz doesn’t mean your kid has to count every single critter in your backyard. (Unless, of course, you’ve got a really long video meeting coming up.)"When biologists want to know how many animals live in an area, they can’t count every single bug, every animal,” says Sophie Gilbert, assistant professor of wildlife ecology and management at the University of Idaho. “We’ve come up with a way to take a small sample and extrapolate to get a good estimate of how many animals live in a given area.”Here’s how to get kids crawling around your backyard.First, gather supplies:—notebook for observations; kids will use this to list bugs and note things like size, color, location, etc.—4 sticks and string, a Hula-Hoop, or an empty box for marking off the area to be sampled; scientists call this a “quadrat”—measuring tape to figure out the area of your sample—magnifying glass—smartphone to help take photos and identify creaturesIf kids are using sticks and string for the quadrat, place the sticks in the ground so that they form a square or rectangle. Loop the string around each stick until the square or rectangle is connected, and tie off tightly. (This way, the quadrat will always be the same size if it’s moved to another part of the yard.) If kids are using the Hula-Hoop or box, have them place it on the ground. (Get kid-friendly instructions for making a Hula-Hoop.)Using the magnifying glass, count every insect inside the quadrat. Don't forget to look in between grass blades, on flowers, and under rocks. If kids are using a bigger stick-and-string quadrat, check out bushes and trees inside the space as well. “Different animals live in the grass than on the rosebush,” Gilbert says. Critters such as ants, beetles, and worms favor dark, damp areas like under rocks and fallen branches. On flowers and bushes, you might find aphids, ladybugs, and bumblebees.Count the number of bugs inside the quadrat several times, and help kids take an average. Then move the quadrat to a different place in the yard and repeat. Do this in many sections of your yard. Make sure to write down all the data in the notebook.Once kids have the average number of bugs per section of yard they sampled, help them average the sections together so you get one number: the average number of bugs in one quadrat. So perhaps a kid has sampled and averaged 10 sections of the yard. Add those averages and divide by 10 to get the average number of bugs in one quadrat. (Let’s say 40 bugs in this case.)Now have kids use the measuring tape to figure out how many square feet are in the quadrat. For example, if the quadrat is 2 feet by 2 feet, your quadrat is 4 square feet. Divide the average number of bugs per quadrat (40) by the quadrat’s square footage (4). That means 10 bugs per square foot of yard.Next, use the measuring tape again to help kids find the area of your yard. (Let’s say it’s 100 feet by 100 feet, so 1,000 square feet.)Now just have children multiply the yard’s square footage by the number of bugs per square foot: 1,000 x 10 = 10,000 bugs in your yard!If children don’t feel like doing all that math, that’s OK. Instead have them simply take notes on the creatures they find inside the quadrat. They can write down names, numbers, and details in their notebooks. Liesch also recommends watching a bug for a few minutes to observe how it behaves. Does it crawl around a lot? Does it wash itself? What path does it take?Another bioblitz option is to be on the lookout for bigger animals with fur or feathers. The trick is finding an observation station where the animals won’t notice the humans. And instead of counting in a quadrat, they’ll count animals during a certain time. “Rather than sampling space,” Gilbert says, “you’re sampling time.”Whether kids are looking for bugs, birds, or four-legged creatures, Liesch recommends sampling throughout the day since animals are active at different times. Birds are plentiful at daybreak. Fireflies, bats, and owls are active at dusk. Later at night is a good time for bug counting. That’s when Liesch checks for insects while he takes his dogs out just before bedtime. “It’s amazing how many different insects are attracted to outdoor lights,” he says.",
"Eight-year-old Finn Riley was flying his drone at a Denver park when the device got stuck halfway up a 50-foot ponderosa pine. Without hesitation, the boy climbed up the tree and shimmied his way onto a branch to retrieve the aircraft.Then he got stuck. From the ground, Finn’s self-proclaimed “hands-off dad” discussed the best way to descend. “He started to hesitate, so I climbed up to him,” Chad Riley says. “We figured it out together.”Even though an element of danger was involved, Riley wanted to give his son the space to make his own decisions. And he might be on to something. Play experts say that an element of risk during play is an important component of child development.“As kids experiment with the world through risky play, they’re learning risk management skills, self-confidence, and resilience,” says academic research scientist Mariana Brussoni. She defines risky play as thrilling and exciting play where children are engaging with uncertainty and might face physical injury.And research supports the idea that rough-and-tumble play enhances a child’s overall well-being. A 2021 study published in the journal Child Indicators Research found that risky play activities such as balancing, climbing, and downhill racing (such as on a bike or skis) promote mastery of important life skills like risk assessment. What’s more, it increases executive-functioning skills like focus and concentration, Brussoni says.Wondering how to incorporate more risky play into your child’s routine routine? Here are some simple ways to get started.Inviting risk—and danger—can feel counterintuitive to parents. But letting kids experience risky situations has numerous benefits.“Yes, our kids might get hurt, but when things go wrong they realize, ‘That didn't kill me. I'm still here and I can manage it,’’’ Brussoni says. And when children succeed at risky play, that surge of self-confidence gives them the courage to push themselves even further.Pediatrician David Krol, medical director for Connecticut Children’s Care Network, suggests that nervous parents start by staying just outside of their kids’ line of vision—you can see them, but they can’t see you. Avoid the natural urge to intervene at the first sign of a problem.“Usually kids find a way out of the situation themselves if you wait a few more seconds,” says play researcher Ellen Beate Hansen Sandseter, who co-authored the 2021 study above. “If you have the courage to do that, both you and your child will learn so much more than if you just jump in and stop the whole thing.” Brussoni even recommends a 17-second rule before speaking up to determine if your child is really at risk of serious injury. If not, try not to weigh in.Children themselves might have some hesitancy about risky play, so a parent’s reaction is key. Avoid shouting “Be careful!” which Brussoni says can break the concentration of a child trying to, say, hop from rock to rock across a stream.Instead, offer concrete safety advice: “Hey, there’s a branch near your head. Make sure you look up.” Brussoni says that way, kids learn to navigate risk on their own.One of the best places to encourage safe-but-slightly-risky free play is in nature. Anyone can play outside regardless of age or size. “Nature is an open-ended environment that has opportunities for everyone,” says Sandseter, also a professor at Norway’s Queen Maud University College of Early Childhood Education.Here, Brussoni and Sandseter offer tips for sprinkling an element of risk into your kid’s play.Find spaces to play. Children need fun, exciting places to go that might inspire a little risk, Brussoni says. These are often spots that adults don’t really notice, like ditches, alleys, and empty parking lots. It’s in these spaces that kids feel like they can take ownership, so be open to different play environments.Interact with playmates. Playing outside with other children can be inherently risky as kids negotiate interpersonal challenges and manage difficult emotions. For example, if one child really wants to build a fort around a boulder while her playmate just wants to climb it, they’ll have to reach a compromise. Brussoni advises that parents encourage self-directed play with other children without intervention, even if it seems like kids are going down a slightly risky road.That includes rough-and-tumble play. Contest games such as play-wrestling, play-fighting, play-fencing, and chasing are great ways for kids to test their boundaries against each other and learn to regulate power dynamics, Sandseter says.Play from great heights. When a child climbs very high, she gets a unique perspective of looking down on the world. Though Sandseter says playing on a climbing tower or frame is fine, nothing beats climbing a tree to strengthen motor, physical, and spatial orientation skills.Move at rapid speeds. Sandester says the need for speed can boost kids’ strength and motor skills, especially when there’s a feeling of losing control: Think rolling or running down a hill, biking, skating, or sledding. (It’s even more effective, she adds, if kids have to move around objects.) For younger children, swinging is a good way to explore speed.Use dangerous tools. Supervised play and activities with “dangerous” tools helps with fine and gross motor skills. Instead of shying away from things like hammers, axes, and whittling knives, Sandseter recommends teaching your kids how to use them safely.Provide plenty of loose parts. By incorporating lots of loose parts into a child’s play environment—think planks, crates, tarps, tires, and branches—they have the freedom to build dens, ramps, and other structures that might introduce a little risk. Look for public spaces that already have these things lying around, or toss a few into your backyard and see what happens.Let an expert supervise. For parents who might be nervous about letting kids loose around tools and spare tires, an adventure playground might be a great compromise. Designed to allow children to play with slightly unsafe materials while staff watches for hazards, these spaces let kids take healthy risks while they play. “Adventure playgrounds tend to have a lot of materials so kids can build their own structures and come up with different forms of risky play,” Brussoni says.Engage with dangerous-ish nature. Kids are often so absorbed in play that they don’t perceive the same threat as adults would when they, say, run around an campfire or play tag near a cliff. That doesn’t mean those elements should be completely off-limits. Sandseter advises that parents provide appropriate supervision so children can experience these dangers in a safe way. Some ideas: Hike up a mountain as a family, or swim out together to a deeper part of the ocean.Disappear. Kids don’t have to get completely lost to engage in this type of risky play. But they do need to feel like they’re in control and responsible for themselves. By keeping an eye on them from a distance, Sandseter says parents can allow them to manage the consequences of their own decisions and blossom into autonomous individuals.Support and scaffold your child’s play. Brussoni suggests that adults help kids take control of their playtime by helping them identify and manage potential hazards, like broken glass. For example, if your child is climbing a tree and you notice some dead branches that won’t support their weight, you might say, “What do you notice about that branch? What do you think you should do? How are you thinking about your next steps?” That way, kids are not only learning to navigate risk but are developing problem-solving skills as well.",
"A zombie terrorizing a town or a costume dripping with fake blood is exactly the kind of scary fun that Lila McGinn loves. The 10-year-old has watched just about every episode of The Walking Dead and is already practicing her makeup skills so she can dress up as a bloody bride this Halloween.“It makes me feel nervous and excited,” Lila says.Her excitement is physiological: According to pediatric neuropsychologist Sam Goldstein, fear can increase adrenaline, which intensifies feelings of alertness, energy, and strength—something that might explain why haunted houses and scary movies can be such a draw for some. And sociologist Margee Kerr, who’s also a fear specialist and haunted house consultant, adds that the right kind of fright can actually be mentally good for children as well.The urge to scream when someone playfully pounces from behind a corner is an evolutionary throwback that protects us in threatening situations. But Kerr, author of Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear, says certain scares can elicit another beneficial response: fun.“It’s such a great opportunity to help kids grow and develop,” she says.Real life is scary enough, but experts say that experiencing “safe fear” can help children learn to manage their emotions—and boost their self-confidence. And since Halloween is back on after mostly being scuttled last year, parents have an opportunity to provide children with a healthy dose of safe, scary fun.Experiencing any kind of fear has a physiological effect in both kids and adults. “Every creature has some sort of defensive response that happens automatically when confronted with something that threatens their survival,” Kerr says.When people feel threatened, their heart rate increases, as do their levels of adrenaline and the stress hormone cortisol. That helps prepare a body’s fight-or-flight reflex necessary for survival.“It’s increasing our ability to convert any available resources into energy, getting all of the oxygen in the blood to the muscles at a very basic level that's needed to help us run or fight,” Kerr says.But because emotions are controlled by the brain and not a physiological response, Goldstein says reaction to fear can be fine-tuned based on the experience. For instance, University of Maryland researchers studying MRI scans found that when people believed they were in control of a stressful situation, “stressor-related responses” decreased in the brain.Goldstein says it may not be that anyone actually “likes to be scared” as much as they are “willing to be scared” in safe environments. That’s why people’s fear responses to “safe” things like haunted houses can be different from, say, crossing paths with a grizzly on a hiking trail.“When we know that we're safe—when we know that we can leave a haunted house or turn off a movie, when there's that understanding that you are actually maintaining agency, it has a huge impact on how we manage stress—namely, we manage much better,” Kerr says, pointing to a study published in the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory.So what makes those “safe scares” so enjoyable for some people? Current context and previous fun-scary experiences can all play a role. But so can your brain’s response.Recovering from a scary experience releases those fight-or-flight survival responses but also increases the circulation of endorphins, dopamine, oxytocin, and other neurochemical changes associated with feeling good. Kerr says often when we’re not in real danger, people can lean into those feel-good states and therefore have a positive “scary” experience.Beyond that feel-good boost that a safe scare can provide, Kerr says helping kids embrace frightening-yet-harmless situations might help them manage future stressful situations. One theory, she says, proposes that when adults have increasingly less-severe physiological responses to a momentary fright, their bodies can learn to react more confidently to similar situations in the future. In other words, the memory of overcoming a safe-but-scary event—like the first day of kindergarten—might help a child feel more confident in handling something like playing piano in public later on.Goldstein, co-author of Tenacity in Children, adds that dealing with harmless fear is similar to the way kids learn from risky play: Each experience teaches them how to cope with and manage stress and that learning can then be applied in other situations.“Scary fun allows you to explore activities or experiences that in the real world you might avoid,” he says. “Most of us can remember our fear of jumping from the high diving board as a child. Some of us never muster the courage to make the jump, but those of us who do—even if we never try again—gain a level of confidence that becomes generalized to trying other challenging or fearful activities.”That builds self-confidence, he says, but there’s another reason why trying out “scary things” can be good for a child’s health: When a kid isn’t able to deal with those harmless situations, the results could be devastating.“When a child is afraid, a cascade of chemicals is released, including cortisol,” Goldstein says. “High levels of cortisol over longer periods of time can be responsible for a host of problems, including depression.”Halloween hysteria is a great way for kids to start learning how to manage their fear responses. These tips can help.Let kids control the narrative. Have your children create their own scary stories or build their own haunted house at home. That way they’ll be in charge of just how scary it gets and be able to focus on fun over fear. “For kids who are afraid of a monster, have them write a story about the monster that ends with the monster being their friend or them somehow defeating the monster,” Kerr suggests.Give kids the power to call it quits. Parental, sibling, or peer pressure can sometimes add to a child’s fears. Instead, make it clear that they can stop the activity at any time. “Just saying that you hope that they enjoy it, and you believe that they can do it, but that there's no shame or judgment if they want to leave it, can go a long way,” Kerr says.Offer kids the chance to be scary. Dressing up like a ghoul adds a softer touch to Halloween monster lore. And finding fun ways to play in the dark can take the edge off and increase a child’s self-esteem and sense of accomplishment. “You’re basically empowering them to get at fear from the other side,” Kerr says. “And in doing that, they realize it’s all really just pretending.”Keep fun fear in context. When you’re just beginning to expose your kids to scary ideas, keep it simple. A haunted house will feel less ominous if it’s part of a familiar setting like the school gymnasium and surrounded by not-as-freaky activities, such as bobbing for apples.Remember that not all fear is equal. Goldstein says that though everyone’s physiological response to fear is the same, the brain’s emotional response is not. “Three children can be waiting to enter the haunted house,” he explains. “All have elevated heart rates but one is excited, the second isn’t so sure, and a third would leave if his two friends weren’t hanging on to him.”Kerr advises parents to recognize their child’s reaction to scary situations and meet them where they are. For instance, fear fan Lila has a twin brother, Duncan, who’s fear response is usually the opposite of hers. “If we're having a family movie night, we will let him choose,” mom Alanna McGinn says. “If we know we're going to watch a scary movie, he's usually downstairs playing video games.”Know when to reign in the terror. Not all scares are harmless. If your child is showing interest in something that might be a little too mature or lead to dangerous behavior, ask them to help you understand it. Kerr suggests asking questions like:• What is it you like about this?• Which of the characters do you enjoy most?• Did you read something or see something about this that you really liked?• How do you feel when you’re watching this?

"Not long ago, Quynh Tran, her husband, and their two daughters, 11 and 14, skated under a Castro Valley, California, highway overpass after dark. They watched their shadows grow up the sides of the concrete walls and pretended the shapes were monsters eating each other. “It's really neat having that experience when no one's around,” Tran says. “And it's a different feeling when you do it in the dark.”Playing in the dark can be a great way to take advantage of warm summer evenings or long winter nights while also mixing up routines—something many of us desperately need. Plus, having fun with the lights out can feel a little bit risky, and that’s a good thing for kids. Do it outside, and you might bolster your mental health, too.Over the last several decades, kids have become less independent, says Abigail Marsh, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Georgetown University and author of The Fear Factor. For example, a study found that in 1971, 55 percent of British kids under 10 were allowed to walk alone to places other than school, while that number shrunk to nearly zero by 2010—a percentage that Marsh confirms is likely similar today.And that's actually a problem. "Kids are built to seek out novel, challenging experiences because that's how they learn," she says. And without taking appropriate risks—like walking by themselves through a neighborhood or skating under a darkened overpass—many psychologists worry that kids won't be able to take on the bigger risks that come with adulthood. “You cannot learn how to do this from a book,” Marsh says.Parents can help kids build these skills. "Playing in the dark is such a good example of something that kids are afraid of," she says. "And parents' job is to scaffold those experiences for their children. Help them contextualize it, help them think about the risk, and make it fun. Teach children that they are able to do more than they think they can."For some kids, doing things that are mildly risky or scary can be especially helpful in a child's chaotic life, says Ashley Zucker, a child, adolescent, and general psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana, California. "Overcoming challenges can lead to an increased sense of independence, bravery, and problem-solving ability–which in a world of chaos can create a lot of safety and sense of accomplishment for children," she says.“For most kids, the dark is a scary place,” Zucker says. “It blocks out other distractions and stimuli in our environment.” So when the lights go out, imaginations can run wild.And when anxiety ratchets up, the brain adjusts how it manages stimulus. “The regions of our brain that control our visual and auditory senses become more active,” Zucker says. That means every gust of wind or creaky floorboard is louder; every shadow is more pronounced.And because the amygdala, which regulates the feeling of being scared, is highly developed at birth, it’s pretty easy to trigger young kids’ fear response. But as they move through early childhood into the tween years, the brain changes. “The connections between the amygdala and frontal cortex, which is involved in regulating emotion, are getting wired up during that time period,” Marsh says. That means they’re better able to manage their responses to scary things.So as the brain develops, playing in the dark can feel a lot less scary—and even ride that line between frightening and fun. “It’s very good at varying our responses to threat based on the proximity and seriousness of the threat,” Marsh says. “So when you're dealing with a threat that's unlikely to be really dangerous or sort of ambiguous, you'll get a smaller response from the amygdala.”But that response can still feel good, especially when we’re seeking out the feeling of fear, like during a game of hide-and-seek in the dark. “We’re scared before anything has even happened,” Zucker says. “The greater the buildup of suspense or anticipation, the greater the release when that fear has resolved.” After a welcome fright, cortisol and adrenaline spike, and endorphins and dopamine swirl through circuits in our bodies. All that creates pleasant feelings, Marsh says.Parents can test out different types of play in the dark to see which are a match for the age and fear-tolerance of their kids. "If kids have structure, they feel a little more safe," says Rebecca Young, a middle school teacher in Lafayette, California, and experienced flashlight tag facilitator.Setting physical boundaries is crucial, she says, like rules about how far kids can run or where they can hide. For older kids, Young says games tied to scary stories or urban legends can create age-appropriate fun. Some ideas:Flashlight tag: One person is "it" and uses the light of a flashlight to tag the other players “out.” Or you can modify so that all players have flashlights and the person who’s "it" must touch a player to get them out.Shadow puppets: Use a flashlight to make shapes with hands or cut-outs and project the shadows against the wall. Tell stories about the shapes—funny or creepy—depending on kids’ ages.Ghost in the graveyard: The “ghost” runs off to hide. When someone finds the ghost, she yells, "Ghost in the graveyard!" The ghost tries to tag the remaining players running back to base. Whomever is tagged becomes the ghost.Glow-in-the-dark games: Use glow-in-the-dark paint, pens, stickers, or glow-sticks to play simple games like hopscotch, hula hoops, limbo, scavenger hunt, or bowling in the dark.Tapping hide-and-seek: Hiding players tap two objects together every 60 seconds and the seeker uses the sounds to locate them. Hiders can change locations throughout the game.Disco in the dark: Turn out all the lights, play fun music, and dance! Add in a disco ball or glowsticks for more fun.Secret messages: Find a guide to Morse code then race to see who can decode a pre-created message first.Flashlight limbo: Ditch the stick and use a flashlight instead. Players must shimmy under the beam without breaking it.",
"When the pandemic hit, Katie Raspa felt stuck. So in July, the former early childhood educator and her husband loaded up their daughters into their AirStream trailer and set out on a cross-country road trip. The Maryland couple’s mission was to give eight-year-old Imogene and six-year-old Caroline an opportunity for play.“People kind of forget that children are supposed to play,” Raspa says. “It helps them learn really critical skills like creativity, flexibility, and cooperation.”Anyone who tries to tell you that play is frivolous is wrong. It’s an important behavior that humans and many other species of animals evolved to help them learn new skills and prepare for adulthood. Play helps strengthen kinship bonds and friendships, and helps kids become better communicators. Play can even boost brain health as well, particularly when it makes us laugh since laughing releases feel-good endorphins. It can also help kids become better communicators and kinder friends.But it’s hard for kids to play when they need to stay six feet apart and might not even have the luxury of school recess anymore. Experts say, though, that play is crucial now as children deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Play helps kids figure the world out,” says Roberta Golinkoff, professor of education at the University of Delaware. “It gives kids a chance to act out scenarios and work through difficult emotions.”And play is not only good for your children—it can make your life as a parent easier as well.To understand how important play can be for human children preparing for life, scientists often look to the animal world.Experts used to think that play had a single purpose. Some speculated that play helped animals train for predation, as when cheetah cubs play fight. Others hypothesized that play could either help boost cognition, encourage flexibility, or promote motor function. (For instance, a capering baby giraffe is also practicing flight skills to evade predators.) According to Isabel Behncke Izquierdo, a primatologist and ethnologist who studies animal behavior, play has many functions, including the ones listed here and others.“It’s useful if we think of play as a wild card,” Behncke Izquierdo says. “It will help an animal adapt, but it takes different forms.” How animals play—and what they use it for—all depends on the species, its environment, and many other variables. For instance, some birds have been recorded using roofs like slides, which might sharpen their reflexes. Adult bonobos run and laugh with younger ones, strengthening bonds and teaching social skills. And domesticated cats and dogs engage in predatory play that mimics how their ancestors hunted. (Read how dogs and horses share a common language of play.)Play serves similar functions in humans—we just play differently. “You might dance with friends, and that will have a bonding function,” Behncke Izquierdo says. “You might draw, do wordplay, and make jokes, and that might be a creative function.” The fact that it’s fun, she says, compels humans and other animals to continue developing these skills.Play might start in childhood as a developmental tool to prepare animals for adulthood, but it often continues long after. Adult dogs still chase and nip each other; horses play tag. In this way, play continues to build and maintain social bonds throughout many animals’ lifetimes, Behncke Izquierdo says.With most playdates limited and school recesses cancelled because of the pandemic, it’s crucial for parents to find ways for their children to play, whether it’s on their own, with parents or siblings, or with trusted friends. That way, children can continue to develop fine motor skills by doing puzzles or crafts, boost brainpower and cognition with a challenging board game, or enhance critical-thinking skills with an activity like a scavenger hunt.Creative play can also boost mental health, notably as children cope with anxiety and fears about the pandemic. Golinkoff says that the negotiation, communication, and language skills built from play activities are important for a child’s social-emotional development. “They often involve acting out scenarios from adult life or the world in a safe space that makes it easier to cope with them,” she says.And play can also be a way to ease parental concerns about their children falling behind because of distance-learning challenges. For the Raspas, play opened up a whole new world of knowledge as they let their daughters’ curiosity guide their learning, which kept the girls more engaged while having fun.“Typically, we spend an hour or so a day on reading or more complicated math,” Raspa says. “The rest of their day is play.” But the play is often a learning opportunity. For instance, at their last stop, the family camped near a freshwater pond, which taught the girls about a new habitat they could explore. “We can use these little discoveries to do more in-depth study and research,” she says.Golinkoff also recommends this type of guided play, in which parents act as helpers instead of teachers. “Kids are curious about everything,” she says. “If you follow your children's lead, you’ll see what they want to learn about.” For instance, taking a safari in your backyard to draw or photograph bugs or plants encourages your child to ask questions, inspires them to research more, and can bring everyone closer together.",
"Dogs and horses are evolutionarily enemies, but domestication has allowed them to have a peaceful co-existence.A dog’s invitation to play is unmistakable: Bowing with his front legs and wagging his tail, he’s basically saying to another dog, Let’s have fun! The two animals then chase and leap and box each other, matching each other’s moves, often with expressions we humans interpret as smiles.Now scientists report for the first time that dogs and horses play together in a similar manner, with open mouths and synchronously matched behaviors.Perhaps most remarkably, the two species also rapidly mirror the expression on the other’s face, a behavior called rapid facial mimicry. This phenomenon occurs in primates, domestic dogs, meerkats, and sun bears, but has never been documented between play partners of different species.“It’s a wonderful study, and takes the questions surrounding play behavior to a new level,” says Sue McDonnell, an animal behaviorist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.“In particular, they’ve beautifully demonstrated play between two species where it’s unexpected."Horses and dogs coexist peacefully today thanks to centuries of domestication. Still, from an evolutionary point of view, they're predators and prey, so scientists were surprised the two species shared a common language of play.What’s more, the study strengthens the idea that play is universal among species. The behavior occurs in such a wide array of creatures—ranging from crocodiles to otters to wasps—that scientists believe it has evolved multiple times. Despite these diverse origins, play behaviors—play-fighting, running, chasing, leaping—are strikingly similar across nature. (Read more about the first evidence of playing in crocodiles.)The purpose behind play is murkier. It could help young animals develop social and hunting skills; adults may use it to relax or maintain their health. The new study, betweem such different animals, adds an intriguing new element to the mystery.In 2018, Elisabetta Palagi, an animal behaviorist at Italy’s University of Pisa, received a YouTube link from a student showing a dog and horse playing together. “I realized they were in sync,” says Palagi.Intrigued by this particular partnership between horses and dogs, she decided to take a rare scientific look at play between the two species.There are many anecdotal examples of cross-species play: Cats and dogs in the same household often play together. Wild animals have also been observed romping, such as a juvenile baboon and a young zebra, an adult wildebeest and a juvenile rhino, and even an adult female wolf and an adult brown bear.Palagi asked her students to search YouTube for similar videos of dogs and horses playing with certain criteria: The animals had no interference from people, were free to move, and were engaged in a play session lasting at least 30 seconds. Between December 2018 and February 2019, Palagi and her students analyzed hundreds of videos, and finally selected 20 for their study.This is Zorro and his little sister, Madison. They are Pomeranians, approximately two years old. They are active, fun-loving toy dogs who think they are every bit as big as a Labrador. They are members of the spitz family and were favored by Queen Victoria. They are named for the region in East Germany/Poland that is most associated with their early breeding. This picture was taken at the beach in Waldport, Oregon.(This photo and caption were submitted to Your Shot.)Palagi was particularly interested in finding and analyzing instances of rapid facial mimicry between the two species. This phenomenon depends on the degree of tolerance, affiliation, and familiarity between playmates. When Palagi’s team began their study, it wasn’t known whether facial mimicry could occur between partners of different species.The scientists analyzed the play sessions according to the variability of play behaviors displayed by each animal, any self-handicapping strategies they employed, and signs of the facial mimicry. (Watch how elephants communicate while at play.)Each session began when one partner—either horse or dog—initiated having fun, and the playmate responded in kind. Sessions ended when the playmates stopped playing or when one moved away, interrupting the behavior. Play sessions lasted 79 seconds on average.Some of the dogs’ and horses’ behaviors mirrored each other’s; for instance, dogs and horses might attempt to bite, but didn’t actually do so. They jumped, pushed, hit or chased each other; played with an object; or handicapped themselves by rolling on their backs on the ground or shaking their heads, the team found.The researchers zeroed in on a behavior called “relaxed open-mouth display,” an important mimicry signal, and found that 12 dogs and 10 horses made this play-face. (Here’s how we know animals think and feel—just like us.)From the 20 videos, the scientists randomly selected 10-second fragments of each video, and analyzed these for several specific play behaviors, such as attack or defense behaviors. The team then recorded the varieties of play behaviors using a standardized index.The surprising finding is that the two species didn’t differ markedly in their play styles.“That suggests there are some shared tactics” that make “social play between mixed species possible,” says Palagi, a co-author of the study published in the May issue of Behavioural Processes.Although the study doesn’t document how these dog-horse play relationships began, it does show that the shared language of play is what maintains their bond, Barbara Smuts, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Michigan, said by email.“It’s an important study because it shows how two animals who look and behave so differently can nevertheless manage to negotiate how to play in a way that’s comfortable for both,” says Smuts. (Watch more videos of unusual animal ‘friendships.’)“It’s even more noteworthy given the large size difference between horses and dogs. The dog is vulnerable to injury by the horse, and the horse has a deeply ingrained tendency to fear animals who resemble wolves.”Although dogs and horses have different evolutionary paths, Palagi notes that both are domesticated species that recognize facial expressions of their own kind and those of humans—factors that may make them more attuned to others’ emotions than wild creatures.Even so, their shared language of play remains a mystery. Perhaps, she says, even very different species can set aside their instincts and choose to have a few moments of fun.",
"Two Nile crocodiles face off in Africa.When Vladimir Dinets first heard several years ago that a Cuban crocodile at Ohio's Toledo Zoo appeared to be playing with an inflatable ball, he didn't think anything of it—at first.Zookeepers reported that the reptile attacked the ball and then blew bubbles in the water, which are textbook examples of play.But when he looked through the research literature on crocodiles and play, he found nothing on the subject. (Read more about American crocodiles.)"People who worked with crocodiles didn't think of publishing anything because they thought [the idea of crocodiles playing] was too obvious," said Dinets, a biologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.He set out to fix that problem. In a new study in Animal Behavior and Cognition, Dinets provides the first documentation of play behavior in crocodilians, a group that includes crocodiles, alligators, and caimans.The reports were gleaned from over 3,000 hours of Dinets's own observations, as well as reports from crocodilian biologists and amateur aficionados alike. In all, Dinets has acquired more than 15 separate observations of play behavior in crocodilians, with more coming in all the time.Given that crocodilians spend much of their time in the water, it's not surprising the animals' reported behavior included sticking their snouts into water and then snapping at the stream.In other instances, the reptiles played with bright flowers, carrying them around in their teeth, and had fun with each other—for instance, by giving their smaller companions piggyback rides.A male crocodile gives a piggyback ride to his lifelong female partner.The Definition of PlayMany animals have fun, whether it's otters romping in the river, cats chasing lasers, or canines "play fighting." Sometimes, though, it's hard to tell what's enjoyment or what's something else, like defending territory or finding food. (See "Panda Playing in Snow Goes Viral: How Do Zoos Plan for Weather?")Enter Gordon Burghardt, a biologist also at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, who developed a scientific definition for play.According to that parameter, play must be repeated, pleasurable behavior done for its own sake that's similar, but not identical to, other behaviors in which the animal regularly engages. It also must be seen when the animal is healthy and not under stress.Burghardt's definition greatly expanded the number of animals that have fun, including turtles and even wasps. And now, with Dinets's new study, researchers can add crocodilians to that list, Burghardt said.Two African elephant calves play near a grazing adult.Why Play?As for why animals play, no one really knows."That's the big question right now," Burghardt said. "But there are so many different kinds of play that there might not be a single function."One of the leading theories is that young animals play to prepare for adulthood. But this doesn't explain why many adult animals (including humans) continue to play, nor does evidence show that play actually makes animals better at their adult tasks. (See "Chimp 'Girls' Play With 'Dolls' Too—First Wild Evidence.")Take the northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), a carnivorous rodent that prowls the prairies of North America. A 1983 study showed that juvenile mice that played a lot were no better at catching crickets as adults than their less frisky counterparts were.Belding's ground squirrels appear to kiss in Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.Similarly, recent studies on play in meerkats (Suricata suricatta) neither improved fighting skills nor reduced aggression in these mongoose-like animals, which live in the Kalahari Desert.All of this isn't to say that play is useless. Recent work in African elephants reveals that play has overall benefits for their physical and mental well-being. (Related video: "Elephants Communicate While at Play.") Similar results were found in Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi), when researchers showed that play increased both health and motor skills.In other words, animals seem to play because it's enjoyable, even if it doesn't have any immediate or tangible benefits.Dinets is hopeful that work in crocodilians will provide valuable insight on the subject, but it's something he intends to leave for other scientists."Why should I have all the fun?" he quipped.Follow Carrie Arnold on Twitter and Google+.",

"Keeper Julius Latoya shares a tender moment with Kinna, a young orphaned African elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya.Do animals feel empathy? Does an elephant have consciousness? Can a dog plan ahead? These are some of the questions that award-winning environmental writer Carl Safina teases out in his new book, Beyond Words: How Animals Think and Feel.Ranging far and wide across the world, from the Ambroseli National Park in Kenya to the Pacific Northwest, he shows us why it is important to acknowledge consciousness in animals and how exciting new discoveries about the brain are breaking down barriers between us and other non-human animals.Speaking from Stony Brook University on Long Island, New York, where he is a visiting professor in the school of journalism, he explains how elephants routinely display empathy; why U.S. Navy underwater tests in the Pacific Northwest should be stopped; and how his own pet dogs prove his theories.It’s important to know who we are here on Earth with. We talk about conservation of animals by numbers, but those are just numbers. Watching animals my whole life I’ve always been struck by how similar to us they are. I’ve always been touched by their bonds and been impressed—occasionally frightened—by their emotions.Life is very vivid to animals. In many cases they know who they are. They know who their friends are and who their rivals are. They have ambitions for higher status. They compete. Their lives follow the arc of a career, like ours do. We both try to stay alive, get food and shelter, and raise some young for the next generation. Animals are no different from us in that regard and I think that their presence here on Earth is tremendously enriching.The issue over consciousness, like many aspects of animal behavior, is confused by a lack of definitions people agree on. We tend to use the word consciousness to mean a variety of different things. Some people say if you can plan years ahead it shows consciousness, but that just shows planning.If you’re having a mental experience, you are conscious. The question really is, do other species have mental experiences or do they sense things without having any sensation of what they are experiencing? Like a motion sensor senses motion but it probably doesn’t experience that it senses motion. Animals do—they react to movement: fight or flight or curiosity.It is incredible to me there is still a debate over whether animals are conscious and even a debate over whether human beings can know animals are conscious. If you watch mammals or even birds, you will see how they respond to the world. They play. They act frightened when there’s danger. They relax when things are good. It seems illogical for us to think that animals might not be having a conscious mental experience of play, sleep, fear or love.Dogs, the author says, know exactly who we are and are often very, very happy, just like this Labrador retriever at Moosehead Lake, Maine seems to be.In the beginning there was almost no neurology, nothing was known of how mental processes worked. Animal behavior was based on fables, like foxes are clever, tortoises are persistent. So scientists said, “All we can know about animals is based on what they do. We can only describe what they do. We can’t know anything about their minds.” Unfortunately, that hardened into a straightjacket assumption that if we can’t know anything about their minds, we can’t confirm consciousness.Meanwhile, people have spent decades watching wild animals. People who watch wild animals don’t question whether they’re conscious or not because we see incredible intricacies of behavior and vast ranges of personalities. I’m talking about vertebrates: mammals like elephants and cats, but also birds.It’s very obvious that animals are conscious to those who observe them. They have to be in order to do the things they do and make the choices that they do, and use the judgments that they use. However, in laboratories the dogma persists: don’t assume that animals think and have emotions–and many scientists insist that they do not.With the public, I think it’s quite different. Many people simply assume that animals act consciously and base their belief on their own domestic animals or pets. Other people do not want animals to be conscious because it makes it easier for us to do things to animals that would be hard to do if we knew they were unhappy and suffering.Elephants play in Damaraland, Namibia. “Researchers spend decades watching these creatures and see individuals,” author Carl Sarafina writes.When the public sees wild animals they feel lucky to see elephants, or they might go to Yellowstone and see wild wolves. Researchers spend decades watching these creatures and see individuals. Many researchers have names for the animals and recognize the different personalities. Some are bold; some are shy. Some are more aggressive; some are mellower; some babies are much more assertive.They see that first time mothers aren’t as sure about what to do, and experienced mothers are more relaxed and confident. They see that some wolves are very assertive and aggressive and other wolves forbear. If there is a fight, some wolves will kill other wolves, but other wolves won’t, even when they beat them in a fight.What you see when you actually get to know wild animals is very different from a casual sighting. If you saw human beings doing nothing but drinking water or running around a field, would you think that is all there is to human beings? If you know the people drinking the water or running around, you have a different experience watching them.A mother humpback whale and baby dive in Pacific waters off Maui. There is a documented account of a humpback sweeping a seal on its back, away from attacking killer whales.Many people think that empathy is a special emotion only humans show. But many animals express empathy for each other. There are documented stories of elephants finding people who were lost. In one case, an old woman who couldn’t see well, got lost and was found the next day with elephants guarding her. They had encased her in sort of a cage of branches to protect her from hyenas. That’s seems extraordinary to us but it comes naturally to elephants.People have also seen humpback whales help seals being hunted by killer whales. There is a documented account of a humpback sweeping a seal on its back out of the water, away from the killer whales. These things seem extraordinary and new to us because we have only recently documented these incidents. But they have probably been doing these kinds of things for millions of years.I tried to take a break from writing about conservation to write about what animals do in their natural lives. I focused on three of the most protected populations of animals in the world—elephants in national parks in Kenya, wolves in Yellowstone National Park, and killer whales in the Pacific Northwest; in all three cases I found that these protected animals are still being killed by people.Elephants have been undergoing a tremendous slaughter since 2009, when the powers that be decided China could import ivory from dead elephants. As a result, elephant populations are being devastated by poachers throughout Africa and Asia.In the case of the wolves in Yellowstone National Park, the U.S. removed endangered species status from wolves outside the parks. So, when wolves from the parks stray outside, they’re often shot and it is usually the alpha pack leaders who are killed. When wolf packs lose their alpha male or female, they often break up. The younger wolves don’t have the knowledge to survive that adults have.A scientist studying animal survival shoulders a wolf at the United States Naval Arctic Research Lab in Barrow, Alaska.Killer whales have very poor reproduction because the salmon stock they depend on is so depleted that they don’t get enough food and are not in good enough condition to bear young. The young don’t survive well, either. Killer whales are full of toxic chemicals that they get from their food and the polluted waters where they swim around Washington State and West Coast of the United States. Even though they’re endangered and they’re supposed to be afforded the strictest protections, the Navy also continues to test live bombs in areas where these whales swim.One pod that desperately needed a young, healthy female had their only young female killed by massive hemorrhaging in her ear canals. A Navy bomb explosion was recorded on the listening devices of the whale researchers the day she died. It’s very distressing that even when we are supposedly protecting these animals they’re not being protected by our own government.I was never much of a dog person because I was interested in free-living, wild animals, but I have two dogs now and I cannot believe how much I love these dogs and how much they are part of our family.They know exactly who we are. They know who strangers are. They are often very, very happy. Occasionally they get frightened by things that are strange or they aren’t sure what’s going on.The only thing they cannot do is speak to us in full sentences, but they communicate all the time. They know what they would like to do and they can plan a little bit. They may not plan what they’re gonna do next week, but they know when they want to go out or when they want to get us to take them out for a run.When we take them to a certain beach, they know exactly what the routine there is, even if we haven’t been to that beach in months. When we take them over to my mother’s, they remember that the shed in her backyard has cottontail rabbits under it and they always run straight to the shed to investigate.I’ve studied wild animals a lot and I’m always struck by how extremely alert they are and how well they sense what’s going on around them. They’re much more aware, compared to humans. Modern day humans go outside and don’t see, hear or sense very well. Our senses have dulled over thousands of years of civilization and settled living. I think that an animal’s experience of life is much sharper and clearer. That’s why I use the term “vivid”.",
"An Arabian horse looks around its stable in the United Arab Emirates. Horses are visual animals—they see better than cats and dogs—with communication skills that evolved to keep family groups together.Let’s face it: When it comes to expressions, a horse is no one-trick pony. Recent findings have revealed that our equine friends use 17 discrete facial movements to communicate. That’s 10 fewer than humans—but one more than dogs and four more than chimpanzees.Researchers at the University of Sussex discovered this by dissecting a horse head and identifying the musculature below its facial features. Then they watched behavioral footage—15 hours of video showing 86 male and female horses, from a variety of breeds, ranging in age from four weeks to 27 years.The last step was to use a tool called EquiFACS (Equine Facial Action Coding System) to catalog the eye, lip, nostril, and chin movements they’d observed. The result: a gestural map that suggests evolutionary parallels among varied species.Jennifer Wathan, the study’s lead author, says the similarities between horse movements and human ones are striking. They include raising inner eyebrows (“puppy-dog eyes”) to show fear, surprise, or sadness; pulling back lip corners (smiling) in greeting or submission; and opening eyes wide to indicate alarm.Wathan says these findings can help us better understand interspecies relationships. Systems like EquiFACS “create a common language to objectively make comparisons across species—even those with totally different-shaped faces.”Her team’s research, which is already helping veterinarians and trainers, could also connect facial expressions to emotional states. “We don’t know much about the emotional lives of animals,” she says. “What does a positive emotion look like? This tool could help us see it.”",
"On a sunny spring day, Ruth Nazarian led a group of 24 second graders to a small acacia grove at their San Diego elementary school. When the children were seated with their eyes closed, Nazarian asked the group a series of questions meant to tune them into their senses:Bring your attention to the skin on your face; what do you feel? Can you find a sound that’s far away? Can you find a sound that’s nearby? What do you smell? Gently open your eyes; what colors do you see?“When you really pay attention to nature with kids, so many ordinary things become magical,” says Nazarian, an elementary school teacher for more than 25 years and certified forest therapy guide.Nazarian is part of a growing group who have discovered the practice of shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, which was officially recognized by the Japanese government in the 1980s and has since expanded into more than 60 certified trails. It’s different from hiking, which is about reaching a destination, or taking a nature walk, which focuses on identifying plants and animals. Forest bathing encourages participants to slowly and deliberately engage with nature. (These five destinations are perfect for forest bathing.)And the great news is you can try this nature-based practice no matter where you live—and it has real physical and mental health benefits for kids.Forest bathing is all about soaking in your surroundings and practicing mindfulness while in nature, whether it’s your backyard, local park, or an actual forest. And a growing body of research shows this approach to nature has health benefits ranging from better sleep to reductions in the stress hormone cortisol.This may be because forest bathing essentially combines the benefits of meditation with the benefits of being outside in nature. For example, forest bathing and meditation are both mindfulness practices that help you become fully engaged in the present moment. Studies show that cultivating mindfulness can boost memory and focus, promote empathy, reduce stress, and improve attention and behavior in school settings.But traditional meditation can be challenging, especially for younger kids who have trouble sitting still. “Forest bathing activities pull us into the present moment without needing to be still,” Nazarian explains. “This helps children become more aware of their bodies. As they learn to be aware of how their body feels, they start to recognize how their bodies react to emotions as well. It’s a valuable strategy to self-soothe and manage stress.”The other advantage of forest bathing: It gets kids outside and into green spaces. Hundreds of studies have investigated the positive impacts of nature on children’s physical, mental, and emotional health and development—ranging from boosting kids’ IQ to improving mental health.“There is something about being in the natural world that improves cognitive development and physical and mental health,” says Richard Louv, co-founder of the Children and Nature Network and author of several books, including Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder. “Specifically, the research strongly suggests time in nature can help children learn to build confidence, teach them to calm themselves, improve focus, decrease symptoms of ADD, improve creativity, and reduce stress.”Ready to try forest bathing with your kids? Here are a few guidelines to get you started.Be flexible. Helene Gibbons, a forest-bathing guide in Saranac Lake, New York, has adapted many of her practices into five- to 15-minute breaks that teachers can do with children throughout the day. “It’s not always realistic to do an hour-long forest-bathing walk with kids,” she says.Shortening the amount of time you focus on a forest-bathing activity is one way to keep it loose, particularly for younger children. Giving them permission to talk and move around, regardless of the activity, is another way to be more flexible.“We call the activities ‘invitations’ because you’re always welcome to adapt them,” Gibbons says. “Kids need autonomy to make decisions for themselves. They like to have that freedom."Draw attention to the sensory experience. Using your senses is all about noticing your surroundings, being alert, and being present—things that meditation does as well, says Katy Bowman, a biomechanist and author of Grow Wild: The Whole-Child, Whole-Family, Nature-Rich Guide to Moving More.“When you’re listening for all the nature sounds you can hear, you’re focused on something that’s not the jibber jabber in your own head,” she says.Ask questions that encourage children to focus on their senses. What does the grass feel like? What shapes do you see? What do the pine needles smell like?Turn it into a game. These activities help provide a fun, loose structure that encourages children to be more mindful of their natural surroundings:Nazarian uses a rope or hula hoop to create a circle in the grass and encourages children to explore the small area with a magnifying glass. (Check out these kid-friendly instructions.)In the What’s in Motion game, Nazarian asks kids to walk very slowly and notice what’s in motion while they’re in motion. Often they’ll notice big movements like birds, then smaller ones like ants. “One time a breeze came through and dispersed hundreds of helicopter seeds,” she says. “We had been stepping on them for weeks, but paying attention to them floating above our heads was delightful.”Bowman suggests going on a tea walk and looking for ingredients like pine or fir needles, lemon grass, or mint that could be used to make herbal tea.In the Camera Game, one kid is the photographer, and the other is the camera. The camera closes his or her eyes, and the photographer guides the camera to a natural scene like a tree trunk. When the photographer signals, the camera opens his or her eyes and captures as much detail of the scene as possible. Depending on the age of your child, encourage them to write about or draw what they see.Lie on your back, watch the clouds float by and see what shapes and images you see.For a rainy-day activity, Gibbons suggests sitting by an open window and listening to the rain for a few minutes. Then have kids draw a picture of how they feel.",
"This small forest in Shaftesbury, England, is perfect for a meditative stroll—especially during bluebell season.Whether you call it a fitness trend or a mindfulness practice (or a bit of both), what exactly is forest bathing? The term emerged in Japan in the 1980s as a physiological and psychological exercise called shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing” or “taking in the forest atmosphere”). The purpose was twofold: to offer an eco-antidote to tech-boom burnout and to inspire residents to reconnect with and protect the country’s forests.The Japanese quickly embraced this form of ecotherapy. In the 1990s, researchers began studying the physiological benefits of forest bathing, providing the science to support what we innately know: time spent immersed in nature is good for us. While Japan is credited with the term shinrin-yoku, the concept at the heart of the practice is not new. Many cultures have long recognized the importance of the natural world to human health.Forest bathing is not just for the wilderness-lover; the practice can be as simple as walking in any natural environment and consciously connecting with what’s around you. For a more structured experience, you can join trained guides for a meditative two- to three-hour ecotherapy excursion. Here are five places to try forest bathing.Adirondack Park, in New York, is larger than Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon combined and provides a rich forest bathing experience.Forest bathers will find ample room to roam in the Adirondack Park. Stretching across more than six million acres of New York State and home to more than a hundred peaks and some 2,000 miles of hiking trails, it’s the largest protected area in the contiguous United States. Native evergreens are both aromatic and release a high concentration of phytoncides—airborne essential oils that provide a natural immunity boost. The health benefits of this phytoncide “shower” can last for weeks. Evergreen needles are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C and some—such as spruce, eastern hemlock, balsam, and pine—can be steeped and sipped as a tea.Certified forest therapy guides Helene Gibbens and Suzanne Weirich of Adirondack Riverwalking offer guided forest bathing year-round in Lake Placid, Saranac Lake, and the Wild Center, an award-winning natural science museum of the Adirondacks. Local tip: seeing the fall foliage and snowshoeing in winter are peak experiences.With more than 50 percent of the country covered by forest, Costa Rica is a forest bathing paradise. Nearly six percent of the world’s biodiversity is found here, so whether you wander through a misty cloud forest in Monteverde, hike across hanging bridges suspended amidst the canopy near Arenal Volcano, stroll a lowland rainforest trail along the Sarapiqui River, or explore a protected forest reserve just outside San Jose city center, you’ll have countless opportunities to observe wildlife and activate your senses. (Tourism could make or break this biodiverse haven.)Guided forest bathing walks are available through Sentir Natural and led by local naturalist Manuela Siegfried, the first Association of Nature and Forest Therapy–certified guide in Costa Rica.Stand in the presence of living legends in the North Island’s Waipoua Forest, where the oldest and largest kauri trees in the world live. Sacred to Māori people, kauri are considered “protectors of the forest.” The transition from daylight to night is accompanied by Māori songs and storytelling. Footprints Waipoua organizes walks among the kauri trees including the Twilight Encounter, led by Māori guides.Local Samburu guides lead travelers through a forest in northern Kenya.You may not immediately associate this East African nation with forest bathing. But in the Matthews Range, in the Laikipia district of the Rift Valley, ancient forests are home to endemic plants, cedars, wild orchids, more than 350 bird species, elephants, and one of the only populations of de Brazza monkeys in the country—all ingredients for a sensory immersion excursion. Guided forest walks from Kitich Forest Camp are led by local Samburu trackers with intimate knowledge of the sounds, scents, and sights of the forest. (Set off on these 17 unforgettable African safaris.)When photographer Tali Kimelman returned home after a full day in the forest, a pervasive sense of bliss would linger until night fell. “I went to bed with such a nice feeling, calm, happy, and I didn't even know why… It really effects how you feel," she says.A deep connection to the`aina (land) is central to Hawaiian culture. Forests here are traditionally revered as life-giving for the natural materials they provide and the spiritual needs they satisfy. It’s easy to see how the abundance of aromatic flowers, medicinal plants such as māmaki, and 175 types of native trees—the majority of which are found only in this remote island chain—inspire travelers and locals to stop and smell the tuberoses. In Hawaii, opportunities to bathe in nature are boundless. Pick a spot under a banyan tree and enjoy the salty sea breeze. Pause by a plumeria plant and inhale the sweet scent. Or join a guided walk with Forest Bathing Hawai`i, led by local Phyllis Look, the first guide in the state to be certified by the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy.",
"Thousands of lakes and ponds provide many opportunities for canoeing in the Adirondacks.New York GuideMore Family TripsThe Adirondack Park covers six million acres (2.5 million hectares) in Upstate New York, making it the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi River. The park includes 3,000 lakes and ponds, 2,000 miles (3,220 kilometers) of hiking trails, and 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) of rivers and streams. Learn about life in the Adirondacks at the Adirondack Museum, where kids can play with old-fashioned toys and make craft projects. Twenty buildings comprise the museum, located on Blue Mountain Lake.

"From the precipitous peaks of the Karakoram range to the fertile Indus River plain, Pakistan is home to a diversity of stunning landscapes. Two new parks—Himalaya National Park and Nanga Parbat National Park—were designated in 2020, covering more than 2,200 square miles of biodiverse, high-altitude terrain in the northern territory of Gilgit-Baltistan.Although its spectacular topography and fascinating history date back thousands of years, Pakistan is a relatively young nation, formed in 1947 when Partition split the Indian subcontinent into two separate countries.Travelers can explore both cultural monuments (lengths of the ancient Silk Road, the ruins of Mohenjo-daro) and dazzling national parks, alpine lakes, and scenic drives. Here are the best ways to get into that lesser-known, wilder side of Pakistan.Known as “Land of the Giants,” Deosai National Park sits on an alpine plateau backdropped by snow-dusted mountains. Each spring, the lush valley is swept by wildflowers and rare butterflies, earning the name “Summer’s Palace” by locals, who enjoy the wildlife after winter’s thaw.(Learn why mountain peaks inspire so many travelers.)This biodiversity hot spot is home to the Tibetan wolf, Himalayan ibex, Tibetan red fox, and golden marmots, but the government granted the park protected status in 1993 to safeguard the critically endangered Himalayan brown bear. The park was also nominated for UNESCO World Heritage status in 2016.Northern Pakistan’s picturesque Kaghan Valley is a place of fairytales. According to a local legend, a prince of Persia fell in love with a fairy princess on the crystalline waters of Lake Saiful Muluk. But a giant was also enraptured with the princess, and held her captive. One day, the prince escaped with her, and in his fury, the giant flooded the valley and created lakes with his tears. Today, visitors from around the world travel to Kaghan Valley for its mountain scenery, alpine lakes, and clear night skies.The Makran Coastal Highway is a scenic drive along Pakistan’s Arabian Sea coast. The route starts in Karachi and runs through Gwadar to the Iran border, and is considered a major infrastructural achievement. Unique, lunar rock formations line a section of the highway known as the Buzi Pass in Hingol National Park. Natural rock sculptures, like the sphinx-shaped “Lion of Balochistan,” can be found along the highway.In the northern territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, icy peaks soar above the Hunza River. Situated on the riverbank and surrounded by glaciers and gorges, the town of Hunza traditionally served as a resting place for travelers descending the Hindu Kush mountains into the Vale of Kashmir. The valley is home to snow leopards, markhors, ibexes, and red-striped foxes.Pakistan’s largest national park extends hundreds of miles along the Makran Coast. While Hingol National Park is renowned for its diverse wildlife—Sindh leopards, chinkaras, honey badgers, and Indian pangolins–it is perhaps best known for its cluster of active mud volcanoes.(Delve into village life ialong the India-Pakistan border.)A mix of hot spring activity, gas, and water reacts chemically with the surrounding rocks to form boiling mud. When the mud is expelled, it continuously rebuilds the cones, which are easily eroded. One of the most famous mud volcanoes is Chandragup, a sacred annual pilgrimage site for thousands of Hindus, along with the nearby Hinglaj temple.In Pakistan’s eastern Karakoram, Baltoro Glacier is one of the world’s largest valley glaciers. Though difficult to access, it is one of the most highly trafficked regions in Pakistan because of mountaineering destinations including K2, Broad Peak, and the Gasherbrum peaks at its head. The area is not only known for its stunning scenery, but as a life source–a large portion of northern Pakistan’s population depends on meltwater from the Karakoram glaciers.(Learn how a team of Nepalese climbers summited K2 in winter.)In northern Azad Kashmir, the bow-shaped Neelum Valley is sandwiched between 13,000-foot peaks and blanketed by verdant forest and streams. The small hilltop village of Arang Kel, dotted with traditional wooden houses, is known as the pearl of Neelum Valley. Hiking paths around the valley afford prime views of mountains and waterfalls.Nestled in the Hunza Valley, Attabad Lake’s vibrant turquoise waters cut through the rocky terrain. Although beautiful, the serene landscape has a violent origin story. The lake was formed in January 2010, when a massive landslide at Attabad Village flooded nearby towns, blocked the flow of the Hunza River, and displaced thousands of people. Today, it’s a popular stop for tourists who can take boats out on the water.This story was originally published April 5, 2018. It has been updated.",
"On the night of August 13, 1947, 13-year-old Suri Sehgal was so excited he couldn’t sleep. The next day, he’d watch the lowering of the British flag and the raising of a new one in his native Punjab province. Once part of India, his town would now become part of a new nation called Pakistan. The newly demarcated country of India would become a self-governing state a day later.Sehgal remembers the Lalamusa train station where the Pakistani flag ceremony took place, the optimistic mood, and the special meal he shared with family and friends. “We all celebrated together,” he recalled in a 2016 oral history with the 1947 Partition Archive. “It was wonderful.”But within hours, the long-awaited transition of power—and the partition of India into two nations, majority-Hindu India and majority-Muslim Pakistan—had become a nightmare as simmering secular tensions, stoked by divisive colonial rule, boiled over. That evening, Sehgal watched in horror as hundreds of people carrying knives and other weapons ran past, on the hunt for Hindus to attack.Days later, Sehgal’s father, worried about the safety of his half-Hindu children, pushed them onto a sweltering, packed, moving train at the same station where they had celebrated Pakistani independence. As the refugee train made its slow way southward into India, its exhausted occupants were confronted with piles of dead bodies being eaten by vultures alongside the tracks.Sehgal was one of millions of Indians and Pakistanis whose lives were disrupted—or ended—during what is now known as Partition. On its surface, the August 1947 creation of two self-governing nations was a victory for those who longed for self-determination. (It would be another several decades, however, before people who lived in what is now Bangladesh would gain that right.) But simmering secular tensions and a severely mismanaged transition turned Britain’s historic exit from the colony into a bloodbath.Partition’s roots date back to the 17th century, when the British East India Company, a private company that traded in Indian riches like spices and silks, began acquiring Indian land, taking over local governments, and making laws that flew in the face of longstanding cultural traditions. (How the British East India Company became the world’s most powerful business.)In 1857, Indian soldiers mutinied—prompting the British government to dissolve the company and take over India. The newly established British Raj appointed officials—many of whom had never set foot in India before—to keep its colony in line. Those privileged British administrators and their families lived in wealth and luxury, while most Indians lived in poverty.As Britain drained India of its wealth and profited from its natural resources, it subdivided 60 percent of the nation into provinces and recognized a patchwork of hundreds of pre-existing "princely states," autonomous entities overseen by local rulers.To preserve its dominance, the British Raj deliberately emphasized differences between religious and ethnic communities. As geographer A.J. Christopher explains, colonial administrators used traits like religion and skin color to segregate and isolate their subjects. They eventually established a limited political role for Indians—but the process for getting those positions often pitted Hindus and Muslims against one another.Lord Curzon, the British viceroy to India, further fueled these divisions in 1905 when he split India’s largest province, Bengal, into two: one majority Muslim, the other majority Hindu. A staunch colonialist who believed Indians were inferior, Curzon faced sharp resistance to this attempt to “divide and rule.” But though the split only lasted until 1911, it galvanized a growing independence movement within the Indian National Congress, a political party that had been formed by educated elites to negotiate with the British Raj. It also spurred the formation of the Muslim League, a political party agitating for Muslim rights within India.In the early 20th century, attorney and politician Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi was elected to the Indian National Congress and began pushing for independence from Britain through non-violent civil disobedience. But boycotts, demonstrations and marches met with brutality and legal crackdowns. (How Mahatma Gandhi changed political protest.)British officials attempted to appease the nationalists, enfranchising more people and increasing their representation in local government. These reforms only benefited a small group of Indians: By 1935, only 12 percent of citizens could vote.Then, the United Kingdom entered the Second World War—and took India with it. Forced to defend their colonizers’ interests with their own blood, many Indians opposed the war. To shore up support, the British government offered India status as a British-owned dominion that could govern itself with British oversight. But the Indian National Congress rejected the plan. In 1942, Gandhi launched “Quit India,” a campaign of widespread civil disobedience demanding immediate independence. Britain responded by arresting Gandhi and other leaders and outlawing the Indian National Congress.The move backfired: The crackdown galvanized many who had not supported independence in the past. Widespread riots and mass detentions followed. “Quit India” had been suppressed. But it—and the mistrust sown during a catastrophic famine in Bengal that killed millions in 1943—convinced British leaders that India’s future as an obedient colony was doomed.Though independence began to appear within India’s grasp, divisions between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League deepened.Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, another National Congress leader, had long believed an independent India should be a single, unified nation. But though the Muslim League also supported home rule, its leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah publicly abandoned the cause of a unified India in 1940.Though the Indian National Congress billed itself as a party for all Indians, members of the Muslim League were concerned it only represented Hindu interests. A united India, Jinnah argued, would give Hindus control of the Muslim minority. Instead, the party demanded autonomy through the creation of a nation called Pakistan.Matters became even more fraught when, in 1946, talks between the two groups fell apart and Jinnah called for a “direct action day” of Muslim protest. “We will either have a divided India or a destroyed India,” he said.The call resulted in catastrophe. On August 16, 1946, Muslim-Hindu riots erupted in Calcutta, the capital of Bengal province. “The air was electric,” wrote a military official in a report. “The result of this riot has been complete mistrust between the communities.” An estimated 4,000 were killed and 10,000 injured in the conflict, and 100,000 were left homeless.As India teetered on the brink of civil war, Britain’s interest in maintaining its waning control evaporated. Facing international pressure to withdraw, George VI sent his cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, to India in March 1947 to manage Britain’s retreat. (How the Commonwealth arose from a crumbling British Empire.)Mountbatten convinced leaders to agree to the creation of two new states, Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. But though he was given a year to complete his task, he rushed the schedule—giving Cyril Radcliffe, a British lawyer who had never set foot in India, just five weeks to divide the country in two and demarcate the new nations’ borders.Princely states could decide which nation they wanted to join, and Radcliffe and his team were otherwise told to draw boundaries that respected religious majorities and prioritized contiguous borders. The “Radcliffe Line” was easy to draw in areas with a distinct majority, but Radcliffe soon found that the religious groups were dispersed throughout India. In areas like Bengal and Punjab, which had near-equal Hindu and Muslim populations, drawing a line proved particularly difficult.In the end, Radcliffe and his team—none of whom had expertise in mapmaking or Indian politics and culture—split both provinces in two and awarded roughly half to each new nation. This meant the new country of Pakistan would not be a contiguous nation: Most of its land mass lay in the northwestern corner of India, with a chunk called East Pakistan that lay in Bengal in the west.The decision was fateful: It stranded hundreds of thousands of Hindus and Muslims in the “wrong” new nation and separated Bengal from the rest of Pakistan by a thousand miles.On August 14 and 15, 1947, Pakistan and India became dominions of the British crown—with the understanding they would ultimately become fully independent. But Mountbatten refused to issue the maps until two days later in an attempt to keep the international focus on Britain’s benevolence.What Britain cast as a triumph was actually the beginning of the largest human migration in history and one of humanity’s most brutal episodes. Uncertain about where the borders had been drawn—and which country they currently lived in—as many as 18 million people packed up their belongings and set out to reach the “right” country.The ensuing confusion and fear was like tinder for longstanding Hindu-Muslim tensions. After years of increasingly polarized rhetoric, old grudges became deadly, and new animosity broke out among those whose minority and majority statuses had suddenly switched. Assailants abducted and raped tens of thousands of women; people butchered members of their own families. Mobs attacked refugees and villagers, set buildings on fire, looted homes and businesses, and committed mass murder.The violence was especially dire in Punjab and Bengal. In Punjab, ex-soldiers who had fought in World War II used their weapons on behalf of local elites who, writes historian Mytheli Sreenivas, “used the chaos of partition to settle old scores, assert claims over land, and secure their own political and economic power.” Though the countries were technically its dominions, Britain did not quell the violence.By the time the violence faded around 1950, between one and two million people had died and both nations were forever transformed. In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who reportedly thought the leader was too pro-Muslim.(The roots of the Kashmir conflict can be traced back to Partition.)Meanwhile, Pakistan’s unusual geography had seeded tensions between east and west that would ultimately lead to a push for Bangladeshi independence. Home to 56 percent of Pakistan’s population, East Pakistan received less funding and had less political power than its western counterpart. In 1971, after decades of discord, Bangladesh declared independence. Pakistan launched a military campaign to subdue the population, slaughtering at least 300,000 civilians; Bengali authorities claim the toll was 10 times higher, citing three million killed in a genocide. A bloody, eight-month war ensued, and Bangladesh officially became an independent, secular democracy in 1972.In the 75 years since Partition, territorial disputes between India and Pakistan have continued to simmer, erupting into four wars and ongoing cross-border attacks. And Partition is still raw for many of those who experienced it firsthand, like Suri Sehgal. Although his entire family survived, reuniting in India at the end of 1947, others were not so lucky. For many in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the losses and memories of those bloody, uncertain days are still haunting.",
"After overseeing the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Queen Elizabeth I issued a royal charter authorizing British merchants to trade in the East Indies on behalf of the crown.Think Google or Apple are powerful? Then you’ve never heard of the East India Company, a profit-making enterprise so mighty, it once ruled nearly all of the Indian subcontinent. Between 1600 and 1874, it built the most powerful corporation the world had ever known, complete with its own army, its own territory, and a near-total hold on trade of a product now seen as quintessentially British: Tea.At the dawn of the 17th century, the Indian subcontinent was known as the “East Indies,” and—as home to spices, fabrics, and luxury goods prized by wealthy Europeans—was seen as a land of seemingly endless potential. Due to their seafaring prowess, Spain and Portugal held a monopoly on trade in the Far East. But Britain wanted in, and when it seized the ships of the defeated Spanish Armada in 1588, it paved the way for the monarchy to become a serious naval power.A painting of a  British East India Company official riding on an elephant at the end of the 18th century.In 1600, a group of English businessmen asked Elizabeth I for a royal charter that would let them voyage to the East Indies on behalf of the crown in exchange for a monopoly on trade. The merchants put up nearly 70,000 pounds of their own money to finance the venture, and the East India Company was born.The corporation relied on a “factory” system, leaving representatives it called “factors” behind to set up trading posts and allowing them to source and negotiate for goods. Thanks to a treaty in 1613 with the Mughal emperor Jahangir, it established its first factory in Surat in what is now western India. Over the years, the company shifted its attention from pepper and other spices to calico and silk fabric and eventually tea, and expanded into the Persian Gulf, China, and elsewhere in Asia.Mughal emperor Shah Alam II grants Robert Clive, leader of the East India Company’s army, the ability to collect taxes in Bengal.The East India Company’s royal charter gave it the ability to “wage war,” and initially it used military force to protect itself and fight rival traders. In 1757, however, it seized control of the entire Mughal state of Bengal. Robert Clive, who led the company’s 3,000-person army, became Bengal’s governor and began collecting taxes and customs, which were then used to purchase Indian goods and export them to England. The company then built on its victory and drove the French and Dutch out of the Indian subcontinent.In the years that followed, the East India company forcibly annexed other regions of the subcontinent and forged alliances with rulers of territory they could not conquer. At its height, it had an army of 260,000 (twice the size of Britain’s standing army) and was responsible for almost half of Britain’s trade. The subcontinent was now under the rule of the East India Company’s shareholders, who elected "merchant-statesmen" each year to dictate policy within its territory.But financial woes and a widespread awareness of the company’s abuses of power eventually led Britain to seek direct control of the East India Company. In 1858, after a long wind down, the British government finally ended company rule in India. By 1874, the company was a shell of its former shelf and was dissolved.By then, the East India Company had been involved in everything from getting China hooked on opium (the Company grew opium in India, then illegally exported it to China in exchange for coveted Chinese goods) to the international slave trade (it conducted slaving expeditions, transported slaves and used slave labor throughout the 17th and 18th centuries). The East India Company may have since been overshadowed by modern capitalism, but its legacy is still felt around the world.",
"During the summer of 1588, England prepared to face the full might of the Spanish Empire, its most dangerous foe. The indomitable Spanish Armada was sailing toward Albion’s shores, carrying soldiers set to invade. Anticipating the attack, Queen Elizabeth I prepared to address her troops stationed at Tilbury Fort in England. Accounts describe her like a goddess of war: white plumes in her hair, a metal cuirass over white gown, and astride a warhorse as she delivered a rousing speech to her men: “I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman,” she said, “but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that . . . Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm.”The ultimate defeat of the Spanish would cement Elizabeth’s position as a formidable leader of a world power, strong enough to rival Philip II of Spain. But Philip had once been Elizabeth’s family, then a potential mate and uneasy ally. Elizabeth and Philip—these two powerful people—would begin their relationship peacefully, even warmly, but they would become enemies, facing off in a battle of empires and faiths that would last until death.The future Queen Elizabeth I was conceived in controversy, a beginning which perhaps forged her strength and skill. Her father, Henry VIII, divorced his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and broke with the Catholic Church, to wed Anne Boleyn, who would bear Elizabeth. The birth did not please Elizabeth’s father, who had hoped for a son and heir. Anne Boleyn soon fell from favor and lost her head, as Henry’s wandering eye sought a new queen, one who would give him a son. He eventually found one.When Henry’s son Edward was born, Elizabeth became third in line to the throne behind her new half brother and her older half sister, Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry’s first marriage. After Henry died in 1547, Edward, age nine, succeeded him, but the young Protestant king’s reign was cut short by illness. Mary took the throne in 1553, to the delight of her Catholic subjects and the shock of Protestants. Throughout the religious turmoil of Henry’s reign, Mary had remained a devout Catholic, and now she sought a husband so that she could produce a Catholic heir for England. She found her match in the 27-year-old prince Philip of Spain, son of the Holy Roman Emperor and heir to the Spanish Empire. If the two produced a successor, the Protestant Elizabeth would never take the throne.Mary’s pending marriage was unpopular, and in March 1554, English Protestants rebelled. They hoped to overthrow Mary and place the Protestant Elizabeth on the throne. The rebellion was quashed, the conspirators executed, and Elizabeth imprisoned. Claiming she had no involvement in the conspiracy, Elizabeth was nonetheless held in the Tower of London for two months before being placed under house arrest in Woodstock Palace, some 75 miles to the north.Four months later, a Spanish fleet of 180 ships carrying 10,000 soldiers and Mary’s groom arrived in England. Although the man who stepped onto the quay at Southampton was an ardent Roman Catholic, Philip opposed attempts to put Elizabeth on trial because he did not want to stir Protestant ire. His intervention saved Elizabeth, a move he might have later come to regret.The relationship between Elizabeth of England and Philip of Spain was complex, but at their birth, few would have seen them as equal sparring partners. Philip, born in 1527, would one day inherit a sprawling empire in Europe and the New World; Elizabeth, born six years later, was an unwanted princess of a minor power. While Philip was mentored by his father, Charles V, scoring his first military victory against France at age 15, the young Elizabeth sought only to survive the religious upheaval of the reigns of her half siblings. The fact that Elizabeth eventually reigned so long, against so many odds, fueled her legacy as Gloriana. Philip, meanwhile, has been branded a gloomy obsessive, whose suspicion of advisers and hatred of Protestantism poisoned his empire. Even so, just as the notion of Good Queen Bess is challenged by historians, Philip’s role has also been reassessed. More intelligent and open-minded than he has often been given credit for, his patronage led to the accumulation of one of the greatest royal collections ever, which includes masterpieces by Titian and El Greco, among much else.Six years older than the intelligent, vivacious Elizabeth, Phillip had come grudgingly to England to marry Mary. He routinely referred to his bride as “my aunt,” since she was not only 11 years his senior but also the daughter of his great aunt, Catherine of Aragon. Like most royal marriages, the union with Mary was for power, not love.Philip’s father, Charles V, ruled an empire that stretched from Spain to Holland to Naples and the New World. Perhaps the most powerful man in Europe, Charles wanted to secure an alliance with England, partially motivated by the fact that their two enemies—France and Scotland—were about to ally through marriage. To bolster Philip’s standing, Charles bestowed control of the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to Philip in 1554.Antonio Moro’s painting, held at Madrid's Prado Museum, depicts 38-year-old Mary I in 1554, the year of her marriage to Prince Philip. Mass executions of Protestants followed until her death in 1558.Many of Mary’s subjects were not pleased that Henry VIII had separated the church in England from Rome after the pope had refused to sanction his divorce. During the reign of Edward VI, England moved further away from Catholicism, laying the foundations of a Protestant reformation. As king consort of England, Philip, Mary believed, would soon have helped reverse that course.In her quest to return England to the Catholic faith, the queen earned the nickname Bloody Mary for persecuting heretics and burning hundreds of Protestants at the stake. Mary adored her husband, who was described by one observer as having a “perfectly” proportioned body and “well-favored” face, “with a broad forehead, and grey eyes, straight-nosed and manly countenance . . . and of most gentle nature.” Despite her happiness, Mary endured several false pregnancies and never had any children. If she had, the restoration of Catholicism in England might have been a success.Because of Mary’s brutality, Philip grew unpopular in England, and murder plots were hatched against him. Luckily for him, he spent little time there, preferring his father’s realms in Holland. He was there when he heard that Mary was dying in 1558. His reaction was as pragmatic as his marriage had been. While the French king denounced Elizabeth as “a bastard” who was unfit to rule, he offered her his support as heiress. By the end of the year she was England’s queen.Elizabeth’s four-decade reign is counted among the most glorious periods in English history, coinciding with a period of feverish literary activity, including the early plays of Shakespeare. The finely crafted royal objects that have survived provide ample evidence of the era’s rich culture. This pair of elegant, fringed gloves was presented to Elizabeth on her visit to the University of Oxford in 1566. Ashmolean Museum, OxfordIn many ways these two young monarchs were remarkably similar. Learned and with lively minds, they dressed simply—at this stage of their lives—as required by both Protestants and Catholics alike. They shared favorite pastimes—hunting, hawking, and riding. But when Philip asked to marry Elizabeth, claiming he would take no less care of the affairs of “the sister whom I love so much, than I take of my own,” his reasons were strategic. After a long engagement, the heir to the French throne, Francis, had married Elizabeth’s Catholic cousin Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, cementing an alliance that threatened Spain as much as England. An Anglo-Spanish alliance seemed prudent.Philip insisted, however, that Elizabeth first abandon her faith—a step too far for the young English queen. Perhaps that is why she stalled and ultimately turned him down, making the Spaniard the first of many failed candidates to attempt to marry the new monarch. They nevertheless remained on good terms, but their relationship would deteriorate in years to come.Both Philip and Elizabeth believed that monarchs were chosen by God. That God, however, was worshipped differently. As Protestants and Catholics fought all across Europe, the conflict would shape their relationship. At first Philip was upset with the pope for excommunicating Elizabeth in 1570. But in time his religious instincts won out against other political considerations. He had always been a devout Catholic, with a messianic belief that the world must be cleansed of heresy before the Second Coming.After Philip’s father abdicated in 1556, he split his empire and handed his son control of Spain, as well as his territories in the Americas and the Netherlands. Spain was Europe’s dominant power, and now Philip II was its leader. As Spain’s might grew, though, so did its enemies. Chief among them were Protestants, France, and the Ottoman Turks. A notorious micro-manager, Philip attempted to handle these myriad threats himself. With bullion ships from the New World flooding Spain with gold and silver, Philip could, in the short term, pay for armies. But eventually even his finances grew strained. To raise funds, Philip levied new taxes on the Dutch in the 1560s, which would spark a rebellion fueled by religious edicts and laws against Protestants. Philip and his subordinates were attempting to defend the Catholic faith from heresies and became entangled in a protracted war as the Netherlands began to revolt. Queen Elizabeth at first watched this conflict from the sides, reluctant to involve her country in the affairs of another.In 1571 Philip masterminded a crushing defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the naval Battle of Lepanto. That same year, the Spanish emperor changed his position on Protestant England. He instructed his finest general, the Duke of Alba, to invade England with an army of just 6,000 men. When the duke told him this was lunacy, Philip insisted that it was God’s will. He had already, with Mary, restored England to Catholicism once. Now he would do it again. Elizabeth held England through “tyranny,” he claimed, while Mary Queen of Scots was the “true and legitimate successor.” Her French husband had died in 1560, ending the Scottish-French alliance. Philip began to see Mary Stuart as a potential Catholic replacement for Elizabeth on the English throne.“His majesty is hot for this venture,” wrote one Spanish adviser, amazed that, even after Elizabeth discovered this dramatic change in policy, Philip insisted on sticking by it. The invasion attempt did not happen this time, but Spain and England had become open enemies.Elizabeth’s favorite palace was named for her grandfather Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. On the banks of the Thames River west of London, Richmond Palace was built of white stone and brick and sported octagonal towers with distinctive pepper-pot domes. It became the favorite residence of two of Henry VII’s granddaughters: Mary I honeymooned there with Philip of Spain, and Elizabeth spent more time there than in any of her other 13 palaces. Despite its ­grandeur—its great hall was 100 feet long—it was snugger than her other rambling residences. The nearby park provided all the pleasures of deer hunting, and the hall was the venue for plays, including those performed by the company of which Shakespeare was a member. In March 1603 Elizabeth died at Richmond, from where her body was transferred along the Thames to Whitehall. Following the end of the English Civil War in 1651, the palace fell into ruin. Over time, it was largely demolished, although some structures, such as the gatehouse, still survive.Elizabeth maintained a firm grip on her kingdom through her mastery of creating a charismatic public image. Her colorful language, biting wit, and willingness to display herself to her people—often after delving into a vast wardrobe, replete with symbols of power—combined to make her both popular and revered. She boasted of her “mere English” bloodline and soon became known as Good Queen Bess. She played both domestic magnates and foreign allies against one another by dangling in front of them the possibility of marriage, dazzling them with her command of languages, deep culture, and ability to compose a well-constructed sonnet.The Wyatt plot of 1554—the year Mary I married the unpopular Philip of Spain—sought to overthrow Mary and replace her with the Protestant Elizabeth. Having crushed the conspiracy, Mary flung Elizabeth into the Tower of London. For two months her life hung in the balance until her interrogators, satisfied of her innocence, placed her under house arrest at Woodstock, near Oxford. This image of Elizabeth at the tower comes from a 19th-century painting by Robert Hillingford.Abroad, however, she could not compete with Philip’s growing global empire. Although England’s naval power grew under Elizabeth, her navy was still heavily dependant on merchant and private ships to defend England’s shores. The key expeditions of Elizabeth’s reign, such as Martin Frobisher’s adventures in Greenland and Canada, and Francis Drake’s circumnavigation of the globe between 1577 and 1580, were remarkable achievements, but they did not present a threat to Spain. Philip II’s empire could count on ports in the Americas, while England had none. In the 1580s Humphrey Gilbert’s attempt to set up an English colony on Newfoundland failed, as did Sir Walter Raleigh’s attempt on Roanoke Island (North Carolina).Faced with the imbalance, the queen found other ways to challenge Spain. One of the most successful was piracy, which took Spain’s wealth and gave it to England. Many of the greatest pirates of the age were English, hardened sea dogs like John Hawkins and Drake. Elizabeth encouraged them, invested in their ventures, and made money for herself as they sacked Spain’s Caribbean outposts and raided its treasure fleets carrying wealth from the New World.A 20th-century illustration shows Queen Elizabeth I knighting Sir Francis Drake in 1581.In 1584 Elizabeth changed her low-key stance toward the conflict in the Netherlands and took an active role in backing Philip’s opponents. The queen set into motion a plan “for the annoying of the king of Spayn [sic],” which—after another murder plot against her was discovered—turned into full-scale aggression. Not only did she back the rebels and fund them with her pirate booty, in 1585 the queen also sent Drake with a fleet on a 10-day ravaging of Spain’s northwest coastal region of Galicia—taking hostages, stealing booty, and desecrating churches. Drake would carry out a similar raid on Cádiz two years later, famously “singeing [sic] the king of Spain’s beard.”Elizabeth had roused a dangerous beast. Two weeks after Drake’s raid on Galicia, Philip decided to strike back with greater force. Combining a talent for bold gestures with obsessive micro-management, he resurrected the Enterprise of England. “It’s ten o’clock and I have not dined or lifted my head all day,” he complained at one stage. He personally oversaw a campaign unlike any seen before: 130 ships carrying 30,000 troops from Iberia and ferrying 30,000 more into England from the Netherlands. Through his attack, he sought to seize England and restore it to Catholicism.The revolt of the Netherlands dragged Philip into a long war that would sap his resources, and leave Elizabeth strengthened. The picture above, a 1590 Flemish allegory, shows Philip riding a cow—representing the wealthy Dutch—whose resources are being milked through taxation by Philip’s ruthless commander, the Duke of Alba. Despite Spanish efforts to control and exploit the cow, the creature is willingly letting itself be led by Elizabeth to the right. Problems in the Spanish Netherlands, which Philip had inherited from his father, Charles V, began roughly around the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign, in the 1560s. The region’s mainly Catholic magnates resented Philip’s meddling in their rule, while hard-line Protestant Calvinists chafed under the repressive measures of the Inquisition. In 1567 Philip sent Alba to break the power of the magnates and impose taxation and religious uniformity. Alba’s long reign of terror sparked a general revolt, during which Philip’s unpaid troops undertook frequent orgies of pillaging. The region’s many Protestant refugees became radicalized as pirates known as the Sea Beggars, who preyed on Spanish shipping. Despite the lack of social and religious unity among the different Dutch factions, they were greatly emboldened by the spectacular defeat by Elizabeth of Philip’s Armada in 1588. By the 1590s Dutch independence was only a matter of time. Dutch victories had weakened Spain and provided Elizabeth with a Protestant ally across the North Sea.In May 1588 his “great and joyous Armada” (later sarcastically dubbed “invincible” by his enemies) sailed from Lisbon—which had become part of his empire, along with the rest of Portuguese lands, seven years earlier. The plan was brilliant, involving the biggest armed fleet ever seen in European waters, but the plan had a crucial weakness. For while Philip set rules to prevent drunkenness, gambling, and sodomy in his fleet, he paid little attention as to how his two massive forces should coordinate. The Armada was first sighted off the English coast on July 29, forming a crescent-shaped battle order three miles wide. Hilltop fires had been readied to signal its approach and, as columns of smoke rose along the coast, the smaller, nimble boats commanded by Drake harassed the powerful Spanish fleet.The Armada anchored off the French port of Calais on August 6, with the landing ground on the English coastline in Kent also in view. The army it had to help transport was just 25 miles away at Dunkirk, but it had not been informed and was not yet ready. While the fleet held its position for 36 hours, two things happened: First, it was attacked by eight English fireboats filled with burning pitch and brimstone (sulphur); then, the weather changed. After the Spanish captains had slipped their anchors to avoid the fireboats, they found themselves unable to turn back due to a violent storm. Using the available winds—they headed home on the only path available: a long, dangerous route around Scotland and Ireland. By the time they limped back to Spain, half of the Armada’s men were dead and more than half of the ships were lost.It appeared that Philip’s God had betrayed him. His enemies taunted him, proclaiming that a “Protestant wind” had driven the Armada away. “God breathed and they were scattered,” boasted the special medal struck by Elizabeth to commemorate the victory. Spain went into mourning. Was “the greatest disaster to strike Spain in 600 years” (as one contemporary complained) a sign that it had fallen out of favor with God?Spain’s empire was still enormous, but this was a turning point. Over the next decade, the two monarchs continued to send fleets against one another, with Cádiz raided again in 1596. Philip’s wars, meanwhile, bankrupted his country, and he defaulted on his debt. By the time he died in 1598, Spain was suing for peace with many of its enemies. Before her death in 1603, Elizabeth was hailed as Gloriana, who had wed herself not to a man but to her country. England’s enmity with Spain ended with the deaths of Philip and Elizabeth, when King James I—son of Mary Queen of Scots—signed a peace treaty in 1604 bringing more than 15 years of conflict to a close.",
"The death of Queen Elizabeth II set into motion a historic transition of power—not just in Great Britain but in 54 countries across the world that maintain ties to the royal family as members of the Commonwealth of Nations, an international organization composed mainly of former British colonies.Change was felt most keenly among the 14 members known as Commonwealth realms, which still recognize the British monarch as their head of state. In the days after the queen’s death, the leaders of those nations—including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—issued proclamations declaring their loyalty to Elizabeth’s heir, Charles III, as their official head of state. (Here’s what happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has passed.)One Commonwealth realm, however, also announced its intention to hold a referendum on whether to remove the British monarch as its head of state. “This is not an act of hostility, or any difference between Antigua and Barbuda and the monarchy,” Gaston Browne, prime minister of the Caribbean nation, told ITV News. “It is a final step to complete the circle of independence to become a truly sovereign nation.”But the queen’s death marks a new era even for the 40 Commonwealth countries that don’t recognize the British monarch as their leader, such as India, Singapore, and Kenya. They will still recognize Charles III as the new head of the organization that works to protect the environment, boost trade, and support democracy throughout the world.Confused about how members of the Commonwealth differ from Commonwealth realms—and the British monarch plays in their affairs? You’re not alone. Here’s a look at the evolution of the organization that historian W. David McIntyre once described as “a loose association of states whose relationship with Britain and each other often defied definition.”The Commonwealth of Nations was born out of the slow disintegration of the British Empire, which covered a fifth of the world’s surface at its peak in the late 19th century. Its holdings spanned from Hong Kong to the Caribbean to a wide swath of southern and East Africa. Queen Victoria, whose reign was critical to consolidating the empire, became Empress of India in 1877.But even as the empire expanded, some of its colonies grew frustrated with imperial oversight. In 1864 representatives from the three British colonies in modern-day Canada began to negotiate merging into one self-governing confederation. The territories—Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada—feared possible aggression from the United States and wanted to establish their own defense forces. They also sought free trade with their southern neighbor.Anxious not to stoke another revolution like the one it had lost nearly a century earlier, Britain agreed to its colonists’ terms in July 1867. But it didn’t give up control of the territory: Instead, a united Canada became a British dominion. The distinction meant Canada could rule itself but its laws would still be subject to British oversight—meaning they could be vetoed at the monarch’s discretion. In subsequent decades, other predominantly white British colonies became dominions too, including Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland).In the aftermath of World War I, however, rising nationalism in the dominions, which had fought alongside Britain, sparked a push for more than just self-governance. In 1926 Britain and the dominions agreed that they would all be equal in status, “united by a common allegiance to the Crown.” The declaration—formalized in 1931 with the Statute of Westminster—ushered in the official founding of the British Commonwealth of Nations.It would take about two more decades for the Commonwealth to evolve into its modern-day form—with a push from the independence movement in India. Although India was party to the 1926 talks, it didn’t sign on to the agreement that would have ensured its continued recognition of the British monarchy. Instead, a movement led by Mahatma Gandhi fought for full independence from colonial rule.India finally won its independence from Britain in 1947. But it wasn’t ready to split entirely. Two years later, the newly sovereign country asked to join the British Commonwealth of Nations—with a few conditions. While India would accept King George VI as head of the Commonwealth, it would be the first country to join that didn’t swear allegiance to the crown. (How the end of British colonial rule birthed two sovereign nations—India and Pakistan.)Then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru delivered a speech before India’s parliament that explained the decision: “In the world today where there are so many disruptive forces at work, where we are often on the verge of war, I think it is not a safe thing to encourage the breaking up of any association that one has.”The member nations agreed to those conditions, and in 1949 they issued the London Declaration, allowing India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) to join “as free and equal members.” The declaration reformed the Commonwealth of Nations—one that would admit other independent nations without swearing allegiance to the crown.Today there are 54 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, which tackles initiatives related to trade, environmental protections, education, and more. Members have no obligations to one another but are united through their common values—and, for most, their shared histories as former British colonies.Commonwealth membership has seen significant churn in the more than 70 years since it was formed. Ireland withdrew from the organization in 1949 when it officially became a republic, while countries such as Fiji and Nigeria were suspended during periods of autocratic rule. Meanwhile, Mozambique and Rwanda became the only two countries without any historical ties to the British Empire to join the organization, in 1995 and 2009 respectively. Both countries sought to take advantage of the diplomatic and economic ties that membership would bring.Many other countries joined the Commonwealth after winning independence from Britain in the mid-to-late 20th century—including Barbados, Cyprus, and Singapore. Papua New Guinea joined after gaining independence from Australia, a former British dominion. Following India’s lead, most chose not to swear fealty to the British monarchy.However, 14 members still do recognize the monarch. Known as the Commonwealth realms, these countries include Australia, the Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the United Kingdom, and—for now, at least—Antigua and Barbuda. (Here’s why Queen Elizabeth’s portrait is still on the money of some former British colonies.)The British monarch is not automatically the head of the Commonwealth. The position is technically not hereditary but selected by member nations. In 2018, the organization announced that Prince Charles would succeed his mother just as she had succeeded her father—but that may not hold true for future monarchs.Either way, the role is symbolic. While a bureaucracy oversees the day-to-day work of the organization, Queen Elizabeth’s role was mainly to reinforce the bonds among member nations by embarking on regular royal tours. (Why Queen Elizabeth II was modern Britain’s most unlikely queen.)The monarch’s role is slightly different in the Commonwealth realms. Although they are not part of Britain—and they elect their own governments—these countries do still swear fealty to the British monarch. The king is represented in the Commonwealth realms by governors-general, de facto heads of state who carry out ceremonial duties like approving legislation and appointing ministers, ambassadors, and judges.Yet these roles too are largely ceremonial. Many countries select their own governor-general—who the king then approves and appoints—and advise them on how to carry out their duties. But the Council on Foreign Relations notes that the governor-general does have the authority to override local governments in exceptional circumstances. In 1975, for instance, Australia’s governor-general John Kerr unilaterally dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to break a parliamentary deadlock, setting off a constitutional crisis.In recent years, some of the Commonwealth realms have begun to consider making a change—particularly in the former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific where younger people view the Commonwealth as a colonial relic.In the 1970s, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Dominica all dropped the British monarch as their head of state while remaining in the Commonwealth. Other countries followed—and in 2021, Barbados became the first country in nearly 30 years to remove the queen as its head of state. (The Caribbean’s ‘Little England’ has long wanted to free itself from British control.)Some have speculated that Barbados’ decision could signal a new wave of republican sentiment. Richard Drayton, a professor of imperial history at King’s College London, told the New York Times that Barbados’ decision “could be a tipping point” for other countries such as Jamaica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.Meanwhile, even the former dominions have considered changing their relationship with the royal family. In a 1999 referendum, Australia very nearly did so with 45 percent of voters supporting removing Queen Elizabeth as head of state. A February 2021 survey found that 55 percent of Canadians believe the British royal family is no longer relevant to their lives—and half said that the queen should be removed as their head of state.Yet even as countries debate these historic steps, their leaders echo the sentiments of Jawaharlal Nehru: In an increasingly globalized world, it’s critical to retain allies—even their former colonizer—through organizations like the Commonwealth of Nations.“We look forward to continuing the relationship with the British monarch,” Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in an October address to Barbados Parliament members.Queen Elizabeth herself was a staunch supporter of this view of the Commonwealth. In 1953, she declared during her traditional Christmas Day broadcast that she viewed the United Kingdom as equal partners with the independent nations that made up the Commonwealth.“Thus formed, the Commonwealth bears no resemblance to the Empires of the past,” she said. “It is an entirely new conception, built on the highest qualities of the spirit of man: friendship, loyalty and the desire for freedom and peace.”",
"The death of Queen Elizabeth II yesterday not only triggered a global outpouring of farewells but also set in motion all sorts of pomp, circumstance, and public mourning—rituals Great Britain hasn’t seen since the death of Elizabeth’s father, George VI, in February 1952.Technically speaking, Elizabeth’s death constituted a Demise of the Crown, a legal term for the end of the British sovereign’s reign. Steps that follow have been carefully choreographed, reviewed, and rehearsed for decades. Edward Young, Elizabeth’s private secretary, conveyed the news to British Prime Minister Liz Truss using a coded phrase—allegedly “London Bridge is down.”Now that the news has gone public, Parliament will meet as soon as possible to swear allegiance to Elizabeth’s son Charles, who became King Charles III the instant his mother died. The new king chose his given name, Charles, as his regnal name, despite the checkered reputations of other monarchs with the name. Charles I was an authoritarian who helped stoke a civil war and was eventually executed; Charles II was a charming lothario known as the Merry Monarch. When asked what her regnal name would be when she came to the throne in 1953, the late queen reportedly said, “My own, of course—what else?”The king’s wife, Camilla, will technically be queen consort according to the British custom of giving a sovereign’s wife the equivalent title of her husband. Interestingly, however, Camilla indicated when she married Charles in 2005 that she would use the title HRH princess consort instead—a break with tradition in deference to Charles’s first wife, Diana, who died in 1997.But in February this year, on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee, the late queen expressed in a statement her "sincere wish" that Camilla take the title of queen consort when the time came, in recognition of her "loyal service."The British Constitution does not give succession rights to the spouses of monarchs, though they obtain symbolic titles when their spouse takes the throne. Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II’s husband of 73 years, was the longest-serving royal consort in British history. However, his death on April 9, 2021, at the age of 99 did not affect the line of succession since he was not up next for the throne. Now the new king’s son William is first in the line of succession.Within 24 hours of the queen’s death, an Accession Council of her closest advisers and other important state officials is summoned. The council confirms the heir’s name in an official proclamation.The new monarch then meets with the new Privy Council and takes an oath to “maintain and preserve” the Church of Scotland, which, unlike the Church of England, is not headed by England’s monarch. (The monarch governs the Church of England, but the Church of Scotland recognizes only God as its supreme governor and, despite its name, is not state controlled.) Then, the accession proclamation is read in various public places throughout the United Kingdom, sometimes accompanied by a gun salute.Meanwhile, U.K. media outlets are in the midst of the wall-to-wall Elizabeth coverage they’ve been planning for decades. British radio stations have careful “obit procedures” that dictate what type of music should be played at a moment of national tragedy, and BBC editors reportedly dread the inevitable complaints that their coverage is in some way inappropriate.In 2002, BBC chief newscaster Peter Sissons was raked over the coals by the tabloid press for wearing a dark red tie while announcing the death of the Queen Mother. He later revealed that he and others had been required to rehearse for her death—and that of the even more important monarch—every six months.A state funeral at Westminster Abbey and burial at the King George VI Memorial Chapel at Windsor Castle will come next. But though the United Kingdom will have a new king, don’t expect a coronation anytime soon. The thousand-year-old ceremony is a joyful occasion that doesn’t mix with mourning, so it’s likely to take place months, if not more than a year, after the queen’s death.",
"Widely referred to as Mahatma, meaning great soul or saint in Sanskrit, Gandhi helped India reach independence through a philosophy of non-violent non-cooperation.He’s been called the “father of India” and a “great soul in beggar’s garb." His nonviolent approach to political change helped India gain independence after nearly a century of British colonial rule. A frail man with a will of iron, he provided a blueprint for future social movements around the world. He was Mahatma Gandhi, and he remains one of the most revered figures in modern history.Born Mohandas Gandhi in Gujarat, India in 1869, he was part of an elite family. After a period of teenage rebellion, he left India to study law in London. Before going, he promised his mother he’d again abstain from sex, meat, and alcohol in an attempt to re-adopt strict Hindu morals.A portrait of Gandhi as a young man.In 1893, at the age of 24, the new attorney moved to the British colony of Natal in southeastern Africa to practice law. Natal was home to thousands of Indians whose labor had helped build its wealth, but the colony fostered both formal and informal discrimination against people of Indian descent. Gandhi was shocked when he was thrown out of train cars, roughed up for using public walkways, and segregated from European passengers on a stagecoach.In 1894, Natal stripped all Indians of their ability to vote. Gandhi organized Indian resistance, fought anti-Indian legislation in the courts and led large protests against the colonial government. Along the way, he developed a public persona and a philosophy of truth-focused, non-violent non-cooperation he called Satyagraha.Gandhi brought Satyagraha to India in 1915, and was soon elected to the Indian National Congress political party. He began to push for independence from the United Kingdom, and organized resistance to a 1919 law that gave British authorities carte blanche to imprison suspected revolutionaries without trial. Britain responded brutally to the resistance, mowing down 400 unarmed protesters in the Amritsar Massacre.A map of Gandhi’s 1930 protest march against a law compelling Indians to purchase British salt.Now Gandhi pushed even harder for home rule, encouraging boycotts of British goods and organizing mass protests. In 1930, he began a massive satyagraha campaign against a British law that forced Indians to purchase British salt instead of producing it locally. Gandhi organized a 241-mile-long protest march to the west coast of Gujarat, where he and his acolytes harvested salt on the shores of the Arabian Sea. In response, Britain imprisoned over 60,000 peaceful protesters and inadvertently generated even more support for home rule.Children in Rajkot, Gujarat, where Gandhi spent most of his boyhood, dressed as the legendary activist to celebrate what would have been his 144th birthday in 2013. This year will mark Gandhi’s 150th birthday.By then, Gandhi had become a national icon, and was widely referred to as Mahatma, Sanskrit for great soul or saint. Imprisoned for a year because of the Salt March, he became more influential than ever. He protested discrimination against the “untouchables,” India’s lowest caste, and negotiated unsuccessfully for Indian home rule. Undeterred, he began the Quit India movement, a campaign to get Britain to voluntarily withdraw from India during World War II. Britain refused and arrested him yet again.Huge demonstrations ensued, and despite the arrests of 100,000 home rule advocates by British authorities, the balance finally tipped toward Indian independence. A frail Gandhi was released from prison in 1944, and Britain at last began to make plans to withdraw from the Indian subcontinent. It was bittersweet for Gandhi, who opposed the partition of India and attempted to quell Hindu-Muslim animosity and deadly riots in 1947.India finally gained its independence in August 1947. But Gandhi only saw it for a few months; a Hindu extremist assassinated him on January 30, 1948. Over 1.5 million people marched in his massive funeral procession.Ascetic and unflinching, Gandhi changed the face of civil disobedience around the world. Martin Luther King, Jr. drew on his tactics during the Civil Rights Movement, and the Dalai Lama was inspired by his teachings, which are still heralded by those who seek to inspire change without inciting violence.But though his legacy still resonates, others wonder whether Gandhi should be revered. Among some Indian Hindus, he remains controversial for his embrace of Muslims. Others question whether he did enough to challenge the Indian caste system. He has also been criticized for supporting racial segregation between black and white South Africans and making derogatory remarks about black people. And though he supported women’s rights in some regards, he also opposed contraception and invited young women to sleep in his bed naked as a way of testing his sexual self-control.Mohandas Gandhi the man was complex and flawed. However, Mahatma Gandhi the public figure left an indelible mark on the history of India and on the exercise of civil disobedience worldwide. “After I am gone, no single person will be able completely to represent me,” he said. “But a little bit of me will live in many of you. If each puts the cause first and himself last, the vacuum will to a large extent be filled.”",
"Emblazoned with mottos, emblems, and historical imagery, money is one of the most tangible symbols of a nation’s identity. As that identity evolves, so too does the design of the country’s coins and banknotes—and the process can be fraught.That has been the case in the United States with a plan to make abolitionist Harriet Tubman the face of the $20 bill, replacing former U.S. President Andrew Jackson. Although the U.S. Treasury had hoped to issue the design in time for the women’s suffrage centennial in 2020, the plan languished under President Donald Trump, who had criticized it as “political correctness.” Now, however, the Biden administration has announced it will move forward with the redesign.But how do countries determine whose portraits to feature on their currency, and what does it tell us about their pasts? Here’s a look at banknotes from around the world and the stories behind their creation—from the delicate negotiations to create a Bosnian currency in the wake of civil war, to the nations that have used their currency as a way to move on from colonialism and reckon with racist pasts.In 1866, controversy erupted when the U.S. Treasury issued a five-cent note bearing the portrait of Spencer Clark, the first chief of what is now known as the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. Clark was not well liked by some members of Congress, who had accused him years earlier of fraud and “gross immorality.” (A Congressional committee dismissed the charges.)Following public outcry, Congress passed a law on April 7, 1866, which prohibited depicting the “portrait or likeness of any living person” on the country’s currency. U.S. law still prohibits using the likeness of living people today, and even commemorative coins honoring a past president cannot be issued until two years after the president’s death.In the modern era, the country has mainly celebrated past presidents and Founding Fathers on its currency—with portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Alexander Hamilton, Ulysses S. Grant, and Benjamin Franklin gracing its banknotes.Bosnia and Herzegovina’s banknotes bear the images of the country’s famous writers, but that decision was driven more by conflict avoidance than literary admiration. In 1995, the Dayton Accords brought an end to years of civil war in Bosnia and created a single state with two parts, the Serb Republic and the Croat-Bosniak Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Similarly, the new nation would have a single currency, the Bosnian convertible mark, but would issue two versions of each denomination to reflect the cultural identity of each side. The banknotes still had to be cohesive, however, and initial submissions were rejected for violating that requirement—including one controversial design featuring Serb hero Gavrilo Princip, famous for setting off World War I by assassinating Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand.Debates over banknote design dragged on for so long that the bank had to issue coupons instead when it opened in 1997, according to U.S. economist Warren Coats, who helped establish the bank. Ultimately, the two sides agreed on using portraits of writers—and even found some common ground as both selected novelist Meša Selimović for their five-mark notes. That note has since been discontinued, but in 2002, the country created a new 200-mark note featuring the Nobel Prize-winning writer Ivo Andric.New Zealand’s banknote design has been “an unintentional litmus test of New Zealand’s evolving self-image” ever since it began issuing currency in 1934, according to historian Matthew Wright. The British dominion’s first banknotes reflected a split identity, bearing both British and local motifs. The earliest series bore a portrait of Māori King Tawhaio, whose image was replaced in 1940 with Captain James Cook, the British explorer who “discovered” New Zealand.New Zealand became a self-governing nation in 1947—yet in 1967, more than 20 years later, it was still proud of its association with Britain. Queen Elizabeth II displaced Cook on all denominations, alongside indigenous plants and birds.By the late 20th century, however, New Zealand had begun to think of itself as a diverse and sovereign nation. In 1991, five years after winning full legal independence from Britain, New Zealand removed the Queen from all but its $20 bill and replaced her with prominent New Zealanders—including women’s suffrage leader Kate Shepperd, mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, Māori political and cultural leader Sir Apirana Ngata, and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Ernest Rutherford—who still grace the banknotes today.Like New Zealand, the evolution of South Africa’s banknotes reflects the country’s reckoning with its colonial history. In 1961, it issued its first banknotes after gaining independence from Great Britain. In tribute to its colonial beginnings, however, each bill bore a portrait of Jan van Riebeeck, a Dutch explorer who in 1652 founded the trading station that would become Cape TownVan Riebeeck remained the face of the nation’s currency for three decades. In 1992, however, as South Africa grappled with dismantling its racist apartheid system, he was finally replaced with its iconic “big five” animals—the rhinoceros, elephant, lion, Cape buffalo, and leopard—that were deemed more representative of (and acceptable to) South Africans.Twenty years later, South Africa made another big change. In 2012, the country unveiled new banknotes featuring the country’s first Black president and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. “A country’s currency is a fundamental component of its national identity,” said South African Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus, explaining that the new design “reflects South Africa’s pride as a nation.” Mandela remains the face of South African currency—and in 2018 the country even issued a commemorative series of banknotes depicting scenes from Mandela’s life to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth.Mongolia traces its monetary history to the 13th-century rule of Genghis Khan. He transformed the nation from a pastoral economy to a global powerhouse, creating the largest contiguous empire in history. Although Genghis Khan introduced gold and silver coins to the empire, it would be his grandson, Kublai Khan, who would widely implement paper money. (Learn more about the Mongols.)Mongolia has kept things relatively simple with just two prominent figures on its banknotes: its famous ancient ruler Genghis Khan, and revolutionary hero Damdin Sükhbaatar, who led the Mongolian army to victory over their Chinese occupiers in 1921.A portrait of Sükhbaatar first graced the country’s banknotes in 1939, commemorating his role in establishing the rule of the communist People’s Republic of Mongolia. The war hero would continue to dominate the currency for more than 50 years, until democracy swept Mongolia in the 1990s. Since 1993, Genghis Khan has been featured on the highest-value bills—from 500 to 20,000 togrogs—while Sükhbaatar still appears on smaller denominations.The Dominican Republic’s 200-peso note pays homage to three sisters who organized a resistance movement against dictator Rafael Trujillo—and whose murder kicked off a revolution.After rising to power in 1930, Trujillo ruthlessly ruled over the Dominican Republic. He imprisoned, tortured, or murdered anyone who spoke out against him. In the 1950s, the Mirabal sisters—Patria, Minerva, and María Teresa—became leaders in the resistance movement that sought to end the brutal regime. Trujillo repeatedly arrested and imprisoned them before ultimately ordering their assassination on November 25, 1960.Trujillo’s regime ended a year later with his assassination, but it would be decades before the government embraced the Mirabel sisters (also known as Las Mariposas, or the butterflies) as national heroes. Although they briefly graced a 25-centavo coin in the 1980s, the Mirabel sisters became the face of the 200-peso note in 2007. The UN has also designated the date of their murder as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.",
"A modern mural in Inner Mongolia depicts the inauguration of Genghis Khan.Known for warfare, but celebrated for productive peace. Led by humble steppe dwellers, but successful due to a mastery of the era’s most advanced technology. The Mongol Empire embodied all of those tensions, turning them into the second-largest kingdom of all time.At its peak, the Mongol Empire covered the most contiguous territory in history. Led at first by Genghis Khan, the empire lasted from 1206 until 1368. During that time, it expanded to cover most of Eurasia, thanks to advanced technology and a massive horde of nomadic warriors.The empire was founded in 1206, when Temijin, son of a Mongol chieftain, assumed power and changed his name to Chinggis Khan (styled as “Genghis Khan” in the West and meaning “universal ruler”). The young warrior had already defeated the Mongols’ most powerful leader and fomented dissatisfaction among his people’s aristocracy. But he proved to be one of history’s greatest leaders.At the time, Mongolia’s nomadic farmers relied on the land to sustain them. Their flocks of goats, sheep, horses, and other animals were dependent on abundant grass and water, and Mongols had to travel frequently to sustain them. Drought and disease could wipe out their livelihoods quickly.Genghis Khan helped allay this sense of precariousness. He united Mongolia’s tribes and supported China’s peasant economy by stabilizing taxes and establishing rural cooperatives. He reformed his people’s laws and ushered in a military-feudal form of government. He embraced trade and religious freedom, and adopted advanced technology of the time, such as stirrups, composite bows, leather armor, and gunpowder.A statue of Genghis Khan in Tsonjin Boldog near Ulan Baator and Erdenet in the Tov province, Mongolia.Genghis Khan’s loyal warriors were rewarded for their fealty and became the most successful army of their time. (Learn about the quest to find Genghis Khan’s lost tomb.)Their success rested on a complex new military structure and new military tactics, like arrow storms, amassing huge arsenals, engaging in repeated hit-and-run barrages, delayed sieges, and psychological warfare. The warriors were assisted by new technologies like the stirrup and technological and tactical innovations they adopted from the people they conquered. (Did the Great Wall of China kept the Mongols at bay?)Traditional wisdom holds that the Mongols began growing their empire due to inhospitable conditions in their homeland. But more recent research suggests the Mongol Empire had an unexpected boon: climate. Researchers think the Mongol hordes may have initially prevailed due to a 15-year-long stretch of mild weather and above-average moisture that produced abundant grasses for their horses and better conditions for livestock breeding.The empire adapted constantly as it grew, and flourished during a 162-year-long period of aggressive expansion. At the empire’s peak, Mongols controlled up to 12 million square miles.Despite its reputation for brutal warfare, the Mongol Empire briefly enabled peace, stability, trade, and protected travel under a period of “Pax Mongolica,” or Mongol peace, beginning in about 1279 and lasting until the empire’s end. But Genghis Khan’s death in 1227 ultimately doomed the empire he founded. Disputes among his successors eventually split the empire into four. By 1368, all four had folded.The Mongol Empire had gained a reputation for destroying its enemies, and it “spread terror and panic as news of the cities they had razed preceded them,” writes historian Diana Lary. She notes that the Mongols sparked large migrations, not just of displaced people but also of those fleeing future attacks. Memories of these attacks loomed large in the imaginations of future generations. (Hear how Genghis Khan has roughly 16 million descendants living today.)But the Mongol Empire left other legacies: the Silk Road and its history of trade; cultural development; and the potential for a modern era characterized by the unity of disparate peoples, and relative peace.",
"Desolately the wind rises. We march thousands of miles over vast distances. Why do we cross the deserts? To build the Great Wall.This poem, written by Emperor Yangdi at the beginning of the seventh century A.D., is a lyrical reminder of the centuries spent by the Chinese building a wall to repel foreign invaders. Just one among many defensive strategies that China employed, the Great Wall stretches more than 5,000 miles long. Rather than one continuous wall, it consists of many smaller pieces, all built during different eras in history. (See also: Building walls may have allowed civilization to flourish.)The earliest fortifications date back as far as the seventh century B.C., but the best-preserved sections were built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The Great Wall is a marvel of engineering and triumph of human ingenuity, but the verdict is out on how well it worked at its primary function: keeping people out.The primary threat to the Chinese came from the northern neighbors. Nomadic herders had inhabited the bordering steppe territories since the fourth century B.C. The harsh environment produced enough for the people to survive, but not much else. The northerners envied the goods and luxuries enjoyed by their southern neighbors, such as fine textiles and a wider variety of agricultural products.The nomads’ population was significantly smaller than that of the Chinese but posed a serious military threat nonetheless. Astride their quick, hardy steppe ponies and armed with powerful bows and arrows, their warriors were capable of launching effective raids on the bordering Chinese states and taking what they wanted.(See also: Trading Silk for Horses: Origins of the Silk Road.)Contact between northern nomads and the people of China was based as much on trade as war. On the steppes, the Mongols couldn’t grow many crops, making agricultural trade with the Chinese essential. There was also high demand among nomadic tribes for textiles such as silk and cotton, as well as metal to make weapons. The Chinese, meanwhile, coveted the nomads’ small horses for war. They could not raise the large number of mounts they needed in Chinese stables, and the nomads seemed to have more horses than anyone else. However, there was an imbalance in these trade relations: The Chinese could manage without horses, but the Mongols could not forgo food or clothing.Chinese emperors resorted to numerous strategies to keep the nomads out, including engineering, warfare, and diplomacy. The first emperor of a united China, Qin Shi Huang Di (221-210 B.C.), created one of the first unified lines of fortifications along the entire northern border, linking existing structures built by previous states.The emperors of the succeeding Han dynasty attempted economic as well as military strategies to deal with outsiders. They paid subsidies while simultaneously conducting campaigns on the steppes and building a new defensive wall. But these tactics failed to stop the invaders. Instead of ceasing their attacks, the northerners learned that not only could their incursions gain them quick access to goods, but they could also be used as a threat to request even more aid from the Chinese.Over the next thousand years, relations continued in this fashion. Then, in the 13th century A.D., a chief called Temüjin unified the Mongols, shifting the balance of power in favor of the northerners. Temüjin—who had become emperor of the Mongols under the name Genghis Khan—attacked northern China in 1211 and captured the capital in 1215. His grandson, Kublai Khan, would succeed in capturing all of China and founding a new dynasty: the Yuan.The Yuan dynasty didn’t last long. It was overthrown by a peasant revolt in 1368. The Mongol court fled the capital and took refuge on the steppes. China’s new reigning dynasty, the Ming (1368-1644), began an aggressive campaign to prevent the Yuan from attempting to return to power. But going on the attack would prove disastrous in 1449, when they suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Tumu. From the 15th century on, the dynasty moved more and more onto the defensive.Despite it being an unpopular policy among the Ming dynasty’s emperors and civil servants, foreign aid was repeatedly sent to the Mongols to contain them, an outlay that became a burden on public finances. Such measures failed to prevent a surge in border attacks by the emboldened Mongols, in part a tactic to force the Chinese to trade the goods so desperately needed on the steppes. According to Great Secretary Li Xian in 1459, the Mongols’ constant need for food and clothing “is a calamity for China.” It was not until 1571 that a powerful courtier, Minister Wang Chung Ku, convinced Emperor Longqing to change the policy. Trading posts were built on the border. The number of Mongol attacks fell, and China could wind down its expensive military campaigns.In parallel with these diplomatic and economic maneuvers, the Ming embarked on building the Great Wall. Extensive construction began in the 16th and 17th centuries. Much of this massive barrier snaking up and down the hills still stands today. Earlier fortifications had taken the form of earthworks, but under the Ming program, they would be made from a stone base covered with brick.An astonishing 5,000 miles in length, the new fortifications were vastly more ambitious than any of the previous structures, costing as much as a hundred times more than earlier walls, according to some chroniclers. The Ming rulers were determined their wall would withstand both nomadic aggression and the slower assaults of weather and time.So far, its victory against erosion is an unqualified success. The barrier’s military effectiveness, however, is somewhat harder to assess. China’s northern border continued to suffer a very large number of attacks. Sometimes these were undertaken by armies numbering as many as 100,000 men, as well as by smaller groups of nomads. One example of the latter took place in Wo Yan in 1555, when a score of Mongol warriors attacked a tower in the middle of the night using grappling hooks to climb the wall. But just as they reached the top, the snorting of their horses alerted the Chinese guards.The lives of the guards stationed along the wall’s vast length were extremely tough. In 1443 a document from the Ministry of the Army admitted that “soldiers on the northwest border are exposed to wind and cold. Whether they serve as watchmen on the signal towers or guards in the passes... they may be away from their base, family, and children for months or years, and are often lacking for clothing and food. It is true they are paid monthly but they often have to spend their money on weapons or horses. Their suffering from hunger and cold is indescribable.”These harsh living conditions could partly explain the low morale among the soldiers. There is evidence of widespread distrust between civil servants and the men. In 1554 one official accused the border troops of cowardice: Whenever the enemy approached the wall, he said, they fled without putting up any resistance. In 1609 another account suggested lack of resources may have been at fault. Since the guards on the towers felt unable to defend themselves, they would not raise the alarm if they spotted Mongols nearby, preferring to pretend that they had not seen them.Chinese troops along the wall also had a great deal of friendly contact with the nomads. In spite of opposition from their superiors, Chinese border guards often traded with their enemies. In extreme situations, soldiers even openly colluded with them.In 1533, according to one revealing account from a civil servant, soldiers on observation towers served as guides for Mongol war parties during their incursions into Chinese territory. In 1550 the military commander of the northern city of Datong reported: “Our troops and rangers often go into Mongol lands to trade with them and have made friends there. Four leaders, Altan, Toyto, Senge and Usin, have incorporated observation towers from our great frontier into their camps. The Mongols take our men’s place as watchmen and our soldiers replace their troops as herders. This means that no strategic information about our defenses goes unnoticed by the Mongols.” For all the Great Wall’s magnificence as a structure, it was only effective if manned by disciplined troops. The remoteness coupled with the harsh living conditions tested even the most steadfast.Weakened by two centuries of conflict with the Mongols, the Ming lost power internally. They yielded power to the Manchus after a peasants’ revolt in 1644. The Manchu, or Qing, dynasty (1644-1912), hugely expanded China’s borders northward, making the Great Wall largely unnecessary as a defensive measure.The wall stands as the world’s largest military structure and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. It remains a potent symbol of the collective pride of the Chinese people. Even so, China’s iconic military monument was an imperfect defense in its long struggle against the irrepressible nomads from the north.",
"Above is the eighth prototype of President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall, under construction near San Diego, California. A new book traces the history of walls through human civilization, from the first one about 12,000 years ago to modern day.If it is ever built, President Donald Trump’s much-vaunted wall, which is supposed to stretch for nearly 2,000 miles along the United States’s border with Mexico, would be the largest infrastructure project since the U.S. highway system, estimated to cost $18 to $40 billion. But as David Frye reveals in his new book, Walls: A History of Civilization in Blood and Brick, the idea of constructing barriers to keep others out—or, in the case of the Berlin Wall, to keep people in—is as ancient as human civilization. Only the people being shut out have changed.When National Geographic caught up with Frye by phone at his home in Connecticut, he explained how the ancient world was split between wallers and non-wallers, how the Berlin Wall set a precedent by being the first wall to keep people in, and why America and so many other nations are “forting up.”It is an ancient idea. People have been building walls since the tenth millennium B.C. The ancient walls were built primarily for defensive purposes. Nowadays, they are built more to prevent immigration, terrorism, or the flow of illegal drugs. But there is a common connection, which is the idea of keeping outsiders out.Trump’s proposed wall on the southern border of the U.S. would stop the flow of immigration from Central and South America. Another motive is to stem the flow of drugs from across the border. The latter would be something very modern. You wouldn’t find that in the histories of Rome, Persia, or China, or any of the great wall-building states of the past.As for immigrants, oddly enough Rome was very open to immigration. In fact, it was an issue in Rome going back to the first century B.C., when people were arguing, “Do we have too many immigrants moving into this city?” It remained an issue for hundreds of years but Rome remained a city of immigrants. At the same time, Rome was building walls for a very different, military purpose. They were worried about invasion, which is in a way a different kind of immigration, an immigration of armed masses coming across the border.The first walls were city walls and they originated with the very first cities, like Jericho, the city of the Bible, which was first constructed sometime in the tenth millennium B.C., as many as 12,000 years ago. It was a walled city and, subsequently, nearly all cities in the ancient world were walled.The first border walls aren’t found until the late 2000s B.C., in Mesopotamia. Security is why they were built. There were two different lifestyles developing: a lifestyle of the people I call wallers, who are workers who build things and identify themselves by their civilian occupations. They sought to secure themselves by building structures that would protect them even when they were sleeping at night. Outside the walls, you have a very different sort of society, people inured to the dangers of living in an un-walled world. Non-wallers were peoples we generally refer to historically as barbarians, like the Huns, the Goths, or the Mongols. They were viewed with fear by the wall-builders. And that’s what inspired the construction of the early walls.I would make the case that there would be no writing and nothing as complex as gunpowder without first the construction of walls. The ancient human need for security is one of the fundamentals of life and has to be achieved before we can achieve other things. It was walls that gave people the security to sit and think. It’s hard to imagine a novel being written in a world in which every man is a warrior. Until a society achieves security, it can’t think about anything except the dangers all around it. As a consequence its culture will be limited.The Great Wall of China can’t be seen from space. That’s a common misconception. And it is actually fairly recent. The stretches of brick walls that most tourists see weren’t built until the 16th century A.D. But the Chinese had a history of wall building that goes back much longer than that, to the Bronze Age. The first true wall, though, was constructed in the late third century B.C. by the first Emperor of China. This is the birth of the Chinese state and the birth of the long wall, and the two events occur simultaneously and are very much connected. In English, we would say they were trying to keep out the Huns. Chinese sources would say the Hsiung-nu. They also built walls in southern China against various other peoples, like the Miao, from Vietnam.It’s interesting that the sorts of complaints that were made about the ancient wall, in particular in China, always had to do with how much work was required. At times, millions of Chinese were displaced and forced to go north to these dangerous regions where they were worked like slaves. Many of them were never able to return home but were forced to settle in the new cities that were built along the wall to support the troops.This is encapsulated in a folk legend about the first of the great walls of China: the story of the weeping widow. Her husband is drafted to go off and work on the wall but finds the conditions too difficult. He’s beaten daily by a supervisor and tries to escape. When he returns, his supervisors put him to death. His widow comes to the wall in search of him, where she hears of his death and immediately begins to gush tears. Those don’t relent for 10 days, until the wall has been washed away.Amongst historians there is some debate over the purpose of Hadrian’s Wall. In the surviving ancient sources it’s clear that it was built to keep the barbarians out. It runs across the neck of Britain, about two-thirds of the way up the island, and its narrowest point is about 80 miles from end to end. It was originally about 15 feet high.It was built by the Emperor Hadrian around 122 A.D. That’s when the Romans became wall builders. Of course, they had built walled cities. Rome, itself, was walled. But in terms of border walls, that was a policy that originated with Hadrian and briefly became very important. We have this beautiful oration by the Roman writer Aristides, where he is talking about how the empire has become a paradise, how war no longer exists and how Romans no longer believe that war ever existed. They have come to see it as a sort of myth created by old men, while they go about happily to their gymnasiums, theaters, and libraries. It’s all peace within the empire. And Aristides attributed those conditions to the walls that girded it.[Laughs] The city of Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine Empire. When Islamic armies first spread out of Arabia, in the seventh century A.D., and started heading west, they were able to sweep aside the defenses of most of the Byzantine Empire and, in the early eighth century, cross into Spain. The city of Constantinople proved a tougher nut to crack, though. It held out for hundreds of years, becoming the headquarters of the defense of the Western world against Islam.But when the Sultan Mehmed II besieged Constantinople in 1453 he had a new weapon. There had been various techniques of siege craft before, but they were very difficult and slow. Cannons changed all that, ultimately making city walls obsolete. They had been around for about 100 years but there had never been a cannon like this before. The sultan had a Hungarian foundryman make for him an enormous cannon that could fire stone balls seven feet in circumference from a distance of a mile. This was referred to as the Horrible Bombard by one of the sources and it relentlessly battered the city walls of Constantinople in the spring of 1453, when the city eventually fell.The most famous wall of modern times was, unusually, built to keep people in, rather than out. Describe the Berlin Wall’s historical context —the Iron Curtain—and the mythology it inspired in books and movies.The Berlin Wall was constructed for an unusual purpose, which was to stem the flow of emigration from East Germany into West Germany. There were barriers between East and West Germany except in the city of Berlin, which was partially controlled by Western powers and partially controlled by East Germany. Until 1960, people could freely cross from one side to the other as part of their daily shopping or commute. But the East German economy was on the verge of collapse because of all the people that were fleeing to the West. So, in August 1961, they roll out the barbed wire, all in one night. It became known as Barbed Wire Sunday, when the people of Berlin woke up to this new feature of their landscape.But the Berlin Wall was originally regarded by Western leaders with some relief. John F. Kennedy said, “A wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.”What they were worried about in 1961 was that something could spark thermonuclear war. It was the journalists who had a different point of view because many happened to be in Berlin when the barbed wire was rolled out. David Brinkley was there, for example, and was taking film footage of the crowds swarming the train stations, trying to get out of East Berlin at the last minute. So it was journalists who turned this into a worldwide cause celebre. The next thing you know, it was appearing in magazine articles, books, detective novels, and movies. The Berlin Wall became one of the most famous pieces of architecture on Earth.That’s not my expression, I took “forting up” from some earlier authors. The short answer is that, as people become more accustomed to security, they have a lower threshold for what triggers their insecurity. When you talk about forting up, you’re talking about the proliferation of gated neighborhoods, homes with security fences, hedges, guard dogs, and even guns, around them.The funny thing about so many of the walls today is that they’re being built for the same purpose walls were constructed 2,000 years ago, which is to keep out emigrating Syrians. The first border walls ever constructed were fortifications against invading Syrians. Today, we’re seeing the same thing in Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, and across southern Europe, because of mass emigration and fear of terrorism. We’re even seeing walls in Saudi Arabia, India, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, and Ecuador. All around the world countries are building walls. In all, over 70 different countries have fortified their borders.This interview was edited for length and clarity.Simon Worrall curates Book Talk.

"I have been working in the American Southwest for nearly 40 years. In 2004 I came across something I hadn’t seen before: a blue barrel with a plain blue flag on a pole, with “agua” written on the side and several gallons of water inside. I photographed it because it was so unexpected, and it haunted me.In 2009—as I became aware of an increase in the building of walls and surveillance towers and other government activities along the 1,954-mile-long U.S. border with Mexico—I began photographing in earnest. That’s also when I discovered that the original barrel was a water station placed by a humanitarian group to help prevent the dehydration and death of migrants crossing the border.The way I have always worked is by focusing on the landscape. Rarely do my images represent people, yet their passage is always felt. The presence of absence.For this project I’d usually fly to a city and rent a four-by-four so I could explore the more remote regions of the border. Sometimes I’d set off a ground sensor, which brought out U.S. Border Patrol agents. Some were terrific—one even came out to protect me because she was worried that cartel activity was nearby—but others could be hostile.People who don’t live near the border may not realize that there’s already a lot of wall in place—roughly 700 miles. It’s expensive and laborious. You have to design it, fabricate it, pay eminent domain to landowners, then install it. One mile of wall has cost anywhere from $4 million to $12 million.But how much good does it do? People can climb over it, tunnel under it, and—when it abruptly ends—walk around it.Functionally speaking, a border wall attempts to do two things. One is to stem migration—people coming into this country for greater opportunity. But only when we stop hiring will they stop coming.The other is to keep out drugs—but Americans are the ones creating the demand. Until we address the problem successfully on our end, the cartels will find ways to get through. A wall doesn’t stop the reasons that this is happening.It has been argued that the idea of national sovereignty—that the nation-state has impermeable borders—has already been broken, by everything from the Internet to global capitalism to viruses. Borders are collapsing on an existential level. To me the building of walls seems more symbolic than anything, a desperate gesture.These images exist where politics, culture, and nature intersect. Although I don’t have answers to these complex problems, I hope my work generates serious contemplation of the issues at hand.",
"During the Cold War, the Berlin Wall came to represent Germany’s divided nation and capital. Though mostly dismantled now, it remains a potent presence, marked by sites that hark back to a sinister time in the city’s history.The Bornholmer Street border crossing is where the Wall first was breached, on November 9, 1989, following a surprise announcement by East German officials that border controls were being loosened. East Germans flocked to the crossing, overwhelming guards, who soon lifted the gates. As the news spread, Berliners gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, totem of the city, which President John F. Kennedy visited before proclaiming “Ich bin ein Berliner” during his famous Cold War speech.Just to the north looms the Reichstag building, where Germany’s reunited Parliament first convened; damaged in World War II and abandoned by East German officialdom, it was renovated and reopened in the 1990s. To see one of 302 watch towers that secured the Wall, visit the Berlin Wall Memorial.Eight blocks away, the Wall’s most heavily guarded section, called the “death strip,” has been transformed into the Mauerpark, or “wall park.” Still visible is a hundred-foot-long part of the Wall. To the south you’ll find Checkpoint Charlie, the border crossing in the American sector that became a symbol of the Cold War and has figured in many films.Ostalgie, or “nostalgia for the East,” informs the DDR Museum, which documents life in the East German republic; artifacts include an iconic Trabant car.Nefarious doings of East Germany’s secret police, or Stasi, are detailed in an exhibit at the Stasi Museum, in the headquarters of the former Ministry for State Security.

"Modern camel riders travel through the Nubra Valley, India, along the route that once linked southern Asia to Rome along the Silk Road.Soft, strong, and shimmering—silk was first cultivated in China, perhaps as early as the mid-third millennium B.C. The art of turning the cocoons of the silkworm moth (Bombyx mori) was, according to legend, discovered by the wife of the Yellow Emperor, a mythical forebear of the tribe that later founded China’s first dynasty, the Xia, in circa 2070 B.C. While she was drinking tea in the shade of a mulberry bush, a cocoon fell into her cup. Instead of throwing it away, she examined it and discovered that pulling on a strand could completely unravel it.Traditionally, silk production was entrusted to Chinese women and carefully guarded as a state secret. Revealing the confidential methods of sericulture was punishable by death. Centuries later, it would be these silken threads that would weave together a vast trade network, linking the lands of China to Rome.In the 19th century German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen looked for a term to describe the trade routes that shuttled silks and other luxury goods between the Far East and the Mediterranean from the first century B.C. until the Middle Ages. It seemed appropriate to name it for the item most associated with Eastern opulence, and Richthofen’s term, “Silk Road,” has stuck ever since.The Chinese did not make an effort to sell silk outside of their country until circumstances forced them to do so. At the end of the third century B.C., Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di (r. 221-210 B.C.) began consolidating forts in the north, the first phase of what would eventually become the Great Wall. His aim was to halt the incursions of the nomadic Xiongnu tribes. Over time, the wall proved to be insufficient on its own; in 138 B.C. Han emperor Wudi tried another approach. He attempted an alliance with another Central Asian tribe, the Yuezhi, enemies of the Xiongnu.Zhang Qian, a young officer of the emperor’s palace guard, was appointed as the leader of the diplomatic mission. In order to reach the Yuezhi, he had to enter enemy territory to the northwest and was captured by Xiongnu forces. After a long imprisonment, he returned to China 13 years later, his mission to the Yuezhi a failure.In this and other subsequent adventures, however, Zhang Qian learned a great deal about the mysterious lands to the west: India and the Parthian Empire, whose lands correspond to northeastern regions in Iran today. In the Fergana Valley, north of the Hindu Kush, he observed horses much larger than those in China. He recognized that these beasts would be valuable military additions to Chinese forces. While in Parthia, he also made contact with the remnants of the Hellenist culture established by Alexander the Great in Central Asia, marking the first major contact between China and Indo-European society. Most important of all, he identified a widespread desire for Chinese silk.Having absorbed Zhang Qian’s reports after his return, the Han dynasty saw the advantages of westward trade, especially the prospect of obtaining the superior Fergana horses. Officials knew they could trade silk for these horses. In time this trade would plug China into the lucrative markets of the West, including the booming Roman world.The route did not arise out of a vacuum. In the fifth century B.C. the sprawling Persian Empire had already improved travel through western Asia, while Alexander the Great’s eastward expansion helped lay the foundations of trans-Asian trade. Even so, Zhang Qian’s remarkable adventures were important early steps in creating the Silk Road.The explorer Zhang Qian had told Emperor Wudi that there was a special breed of horses of great stamina in the Fergana Valley, which would equip China with a formidable cavalry. Delighted, the emperor allowed the trading of silk with the inhabitants of the Fergana region, which led to what would become the Silk Road. A first-century B.C. poem, part of the chronicle of China’s history, the Shiji, marks the arrival of the first of these steeds: The heavenly horses arrive from the Western frontier / Having traveled 10,000 li, they come with great virtue. / With loyal spirit, they defeat foreign nations / And crossing the deserts, all barbarians succumb in their wake! Later, during the Tang period, the horse became a status symbol, a kind of sports car of its day. The breed, however, no longer exists, and is preserved only in paintings and sculptures.The Chinese capital, Chang’an (Xi’an), was the eastern starting point of this trading route. Strictly speaking, the Silk Road was not a single highway but a network of roads that twisted and turned on the way from east to west. From Chang’an, for example, one branch went southwest to the mouth of the Ganges in India. Among the luxury products traveling west were jade, turtle shells, bird feathers, and, of course, silk. Traders also brought metals—silver, iron, lead, tin, and gold—and foodstuffs—saffron and other spices, tea, carrots, and pomegranates.By 102 B.C. the Chinese controlled traffic along the Silk Road as far as the Fergana Valley. Although goods traveled thousands of miles in both directions, the merchants themselves probably only journeyed along short sections. When they reached the next city, they would sell their merchandise to the locals, who then would travel along the next segment and trade with the merchants there. The Dunhuang Oasis was the main Chinese customs post. Westbound traders had to wait several days to pay their exit duties while soldiers carefully searched their baggage to make sure no one was smuggling silkworms or cocoons out of the country.From there, the westward journey split into three main routes. The two northern roads passed on either side of the Heavenly Mountains (Tian Shan), whose peaks soar to heights of 24,000 feet. The third road went south and passed through Khotan (near modern-day Hotan in China), famous for silken rugs. This route skirted the edge of the almost impassable Taklimakan Desert, where extreme temperatures and sandstorms claimed the lives of many travelers.The northern and southern roads met again near Kashgar, on the border with modern-day China and Kyrgyzstan. The traders then crossed the Pamir Mountains along narrow snowy tracks, before descending into the Fergana Valley. Somewhere near here they rested in a place the second-century Egyptian geographer Ptolemy referred to only as the “Stone Tower.”Believed by modern historians to be the city of Taxkorgan, Ptolemy considered it the midway point of the Silk Road. Here, as in other cities along the route, merchants from all over central Asia waited to trade. These included the Sogdians, whose lands centered on the trading city of Samarqand (Uzbekistan), and who became the most prominent of the Silk Road’s middlemen between China and the West. Farther west still, the Parthians thronged the routes that passed through their lands, centered on areas of modern-day Iran, Iraq, and Turkmenistan, where the great trading city of Merv is located.Parthian kings built caravansaries to accommodate the traders and their camels along the route to Ctesiphon (near Baghdad), their first-century B.C. capital. From here, they crossed the desert wastes of Syria via Palmyra. Having reached the Mediterranean, goods were shipped to Rome from ports such as Tyre and Antioch.In Rome, silk was synonymous with wealth but also with vanity. Several times in Roman history, laws were passed to regulate the trade, or use, of silk. The emperor Augustus considered that the fabric encouraged immoral behavior, while Tiberius prohibited men from wearing silk clothes. The first-century writer and moralist Seneca sternly criticized Roman matrons’ taste for the exotic fabric in his book De beneficiis: “Silk dresses can barely deserve to be called dresses when they cover neither [a lady’s] body nor their shame. When they wear them, they cannot swear with good conscience that they are not naked. They are imported at vast expense . . . in order that our matrons may show as much of their persons in public as they do to their lovers in private.”Rome itself had developed a love-hate relationship with silk. One of the earliest recorded observations occurred during a conflict with the Parthians, whose archers soundly defeated Roman troops in 53 B.C. at the Battle of Carrhae in modern-day Turkey. Before the battle, Romans made note of the Parthians’ bold, beautiful spectacle that conveyed power and invincibility as well as finesse: colorful banners woven from Chinese silk. The Roman second-century historian Florus later described the moment when the Parthian generals “displayed all around [the Romans] their standards, fluttering with . . . silken pennons” before describing how the army was slaughtered and its Roman commander killed.Ever since the shameful rout at Carrhae, silk both troubled and delighted the Romans. A century after the battle, silk was immensely popular across the Roman Empire. This weakness for a foreign luxury was bitterly criticized by Rome’s stern moralists. In the first century Pliny the Elder wrote: “At least a hundred million sesterces flow out of our empire every year to India, China, and Arabia. That is how much luxury and women cost us!”The Chinese monopoly on silk production may well have been lost as early as the first century B.C., when sericultural knowledge reached Korea. It took longer, however, to arrive in the West. The disruption to trade caused by the wars between Rome and the Sasanian Empire (successors to the Parthians) led the Byzantine emperor Justinian to set up his own silk-production center. He entrusted monks to bring back silkworm eggs from China along the Silk Road. Wrapping the eggs in dung to keep them warm, the monks smuggled them out inside one of their walking sticks. According to the historian Procopius: “They carried the eggs back to Byzantium and after the worms hatched, fed them with mulberry leaves and so managed to grow silk in Roman lands.”In A.D. 220 the Han dynasty collapsed, and China passed through a period of political upheaval. Over the coming centuries, the monopoly on silk that the Han had so carefully nurtured fell apart, and silk production started to spring up outside China. By the sixth century even the Romans had secured their own independent supply after the Roman emperor Justinian successfully smuggled silkworms into his empire.Since the moment it left Chang’an, to its unpacking in the aristocratic surroundings of a Roman villa about a year later, a roll of silk would have passed through a dazzling array of cultures, languages, and climes. Even though silk production had spread to the western lands, the Silk Road continued to be a vibrant connection of cultures and trade. Not only products traveled along the Silk Road, but ideas too: convulsions in human thought and faith that reshaped the world. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam would all travel along these paths and touch cultures along the way, shaping people’s beliefs and philosophies over time. In the seventh century, after China returned to growth and prosperity under the Tang dynasty, the route was boosted by renewed Chinese demand for luxury goods from the West, including silver-making techniques, chairs, and ceramics. In part to protect this trade, the Tang embarked on a major expansion westward, even as the first Christian missionaries were moving east along the Silk Road. At the same time, Islam was rising in the Arabian Peninsula, and during the eighth century, it spread farther and farther east along the trade routes.In A.D. 751 Muslim Abassid troops clashed with the Chinese at the Battle of Talas. This pivotal battle, which checked China’s westward expansion, may have contributed to another, no less significant outcome: According to lore, several of the Chinese prisoners from the Battle of Talas taught their captors a craft, that disseminated through the Muslim lands into southern Europe. The skill these Chinese artisans passed on to their captors was nothing less than how to make paper, which would transform history and how it would be written.",
"Platoons of clay soldiers were buried with China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, to accompany him during his eternal rest.Workers digging a well outside the city of Xi'an, China, in 1974 struck upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in the world: a life-size clay soldier poised for battle.The diggers notified Chinese authorities, who dispatched government archaeologists to the site.They found not one, but thousands of clay soldiers, each with unique facial expressions and positioned according to rank. And though largely gray today, patches of paint hint at once brightly colored clothes. Further excavations have revealed swords, arrow tips, and other weapons, many in pristine condition.The soldiers are in trenchlike, underground corridors. In some of the corridors, clay horses are aligned four abreast; behind them are wooden chariots.The terra-cotta army, as it is known, is part of an elaborate mausoleum created to accompany the first emperor of China into the afterlife, according to archaeologists.Ying Zheng took the throne in 246 B.C. at the age of 13. By 221 B.C. he had unified a collection of warring kingdoms and took the name of Qin Shi Huang Di—the First Emperor of Qin.During his rule, Qin standardized coins, weights, and measures; interlinked the states with canals and roads; and is credited for building the first version of the Great Wall.According to writings of court historian Siam Qian during the following Han dynasty, Qin ordered the mausoleum's construction shortly after taking the throne. More than 700,000 laborers worked on the project, which was halted in 209 B.C. amid uprisings a year after Qin's death.To date, four pits have been partially excavated. Three are filled with the terra-cotta soldiers, horse-drawn chariots, and weapons. The fourth pit is empty, a testament to the original unfinished construction.Archaeologists estimate the pits may contain as many as 8,000 figures, but the total may never be known.Qin's tomb itself remains unexcavated, though Siam Qian's writings suggest even greater treasures."The tomb was filled with models of palaces, pavilions and offices as well as fine vessels, precious stones and rarities," reads a translation of the text.The account indicates the tomb contains replicas of the area's rivers and streams made with mercury flowing to the sea through hills and mountains of bronze. Precious stones such as pearls are said to represent the sun, moon, and other stars.Modern tests on the tomb mound have revealed unusually high concentrations of mercury, lending credence to at least some of the historical account.Chinese archaeologists are also using remote-sensing technology to probe the tomb mound. The technique recently revealed an underground chamber with four stairlike walls. An archaeologist working on the site told the Chinese press that the chamber may have been built for the soul of the emperor.Experimental pits dug around the tomb have revealed dancers, musicians, and acrobats full of life and caught in mid-performance, a sharp contrast to the military poses of the famous terra-cotta soldiers.But further excavations of the tomb itself are on hold, at least for now."It is best to keep the ancient tomb untouched, because of the complex conditions inside," Duan Qinbao, a researcher with the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeology Institute, told the China Daily.(Read more about the complicated history surrounding the burial complex and see a map of the tomb.)A person standing in the doorway of the Monastery at Petra, Jordan,  shows the enormity of the ancient building's entrance. Carved into the  sandstone hill by the Nabataeans in the second century A.D., this  towering structure, called El-Deir, may have been used as a church or  monastery by later societies, but likely began as a temple.",
"The death of Queen Elizabeth II today has brought the British monarchy’s longest ever reign to an end. But though she descended from royalty, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor wasn’t supposed to be queen—until a series of historical vagaries placed her in the crosshairs of the world’s most visible monarchy.Elizabeth’s great-great-grandmother, Victoria, reigned over the British Empire for nearly 64 years, longer than any British monarch before her. And she wasn’t first in line for the throne. She was fifth in the line of succession, but a series of deaths put her in power when she was just 18.Victoria’s eldest son, Edward VII, was heir to the throne for decades, but his long-living mother prevented his ascension to the throne until he was 59 years old. He reigned for only nine years before dying. By then, his eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, had died at just 28, so his second son took the throne.George V had a 25-year reign, and after his death in 1936 his eldest son, Edward VIII—Elizabeth’s uncle—took the throne. But when he fell in love with the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson, he decided to abdicate.This created a constitutional crisis, and again the line of succession veered to another arm of the family. If Edward VIII had had children of his own, they might have stepped up. Instead, the disgraced king’s brother, George VI, reluctantly took the throne.Since he had no sons (at the time, male heirs took precedence because of the country’s system of male primogeniture, a tradition that ended in 2013), his firstborn daughter, Elizabeth, became first in line for the monarchy.At the time of the abdication, Elizabeth was 10 years old. She had spent her childhood in both London and the nearby countryside. Though her London home on the edge of Hyde Park was elegant and large, it had no security to speak of. The princess was educated at home alongside her younger sister, Margaret, by a variety of tutors.“If Princess Elizabeth had grown up to be a cousin or a sister of the monarch, she would still have undertaken some royal duties but would also have enjoyed a quieter life with less press scrutiny and more time to pursue her own interests,” says historian and royal commentator Carolyn Harris.Instead, Elizabeth’s life changed dramatically in 1936 once her uncle abdicated and her father became King George VI. Suddenly she lived in Buckingham Palace. Her movements were restricted; her education changed. Though her governess, Marion Crawford, attempted to give her life some normalcy, taking her and her sister on outings and even organizing a scouting group among the children of palace employees and a variety of aristocratic friends and relatives, Elizabeth’s life was anything but normal.The princess was expected to master the social graces of a royal and gain an understanding of the history, protocols, and laws of the country over which she would one day reign. She studied history with the royal archivist, got lessons in religion from the archbishop of Canterbury, and became fluent in French.Experts disagree on the extent of her education. Taking the throne “must have been extraordinarily difficult for her, particularly because she’d never been to school and never had that wider education that we perhaps now take for granted,” royal correspondent Chris Shop told the Daily Express in 2019.Her father, who despite his shy reserve and stutter became a beloved national figure, helped too, says Harris. “Elizabeth learned her future role as the sovereign by shadowing her father. George VI had not been born to be king and was uncomfortable with public speaking but rose to the occasion.” The hesitant king reigned until his death in 1952, when Elizabeth became queen.A childhood friend, Sonia Berry, told the Sunday Telegraph’s Andrew Alderson in 2006 that Queen Elizabeth would likely have chosen a different trajectory for her life if she had had the chance. “I think she would have been happier married and living in the country with her dogs and horses,” said Berry. “It’s a very lonely job because, even when she knows people well, she is still the Queen, and there is still a barrier there.”As for the unplanned, yet fateful, series of events that led Elizabeth II to the throne, the exception has always been the rule for the royal family, says Harris, who points out that, until recently, succession often went in unexpected directions because of death, abdication, or an absence of direct heirs in the main branch of the royal family.“The current royal succession, where there are three generations of direct male heirs [Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince George] is comparatively rare in British royal history,” she says.Like those who came before her, Elizabeth II has made it clear it was her duty to serve. “I declare before you that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong,” she said to her future subjects during a radio address given on her 21st birthday, in April 1947.More than 75 years later, she has followed through on that promise—even if it wasn’t one she wanted to make.",
"Prince Harry and Meghan have announced they will pull back from royal duties and split their time between the U.K. and North America. They plan to focus on charity work and raising their son, Archie, out of the limelight. In 2018, the couple took a stroll through a redwood forest during an official visit to New Zealand.Call it the Instagram heard round the world: a picture of a smiling Duke and Duchess of Sussex (Prince Harry and Meghan Markle) and a bombshell announcement that they will “step back” from their royal roles. The royal ripples are leading some to draw parallels with another monarchical mess: Edward VIII’s 1936 decision to step back from his role as king of England so he could marry American socialite Wallis Simpson.But though both situations involve frustrated royals, American divorcees, and public furor, the similarities are not as straightforward as they might seem.When the future king of England fell in love with a charming American woman in the early 1930s, it seemed like one of the playboy prince’s many affairs. But when Edward VIII became king in January 1936, it became clear he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson.The planned marriage presented obstacles that were as political as they were personal. As monarch, Edward was head of the Church of England, and to marry the twice-divorced Simpson would defy church policy that forbade divorced spouses from remarrying during the lifetimes of their former spouses.In December 1936, less than a year after assuming the title, Edward VIII became the first monarch to willingly renounce the throne when he decided to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. A few years later, at the dawn of World War II, they returned to England for the first time and were photographed at their temporary home in Sussex.As sovereign, Edward faced the wrath of his own people, many of whom saw Simpson as a gold-digging “fallen woman” who wanted to entrap their king. And among his own cabinet, the king faced staunch opposition from figures who disliked Simpson and wondered if she exerted some kind of sexual control over Edward. The king was even investigated and bugged by his own government, and faced rumors that suggested Simpson was engaged in an affair with Adolf Hitler’s diplomatic envoy, Joachim von Ribbentrop.The result was a constitutional crisis and an intolerable puzzle for the king, who had long dreaded becoming monarch. Edward briefly lobbied for a morganatic marriage (a marriage between a higher ranking aristocratic man and lower ranking woman, where any children from the marriage cannot inherit land or titles), but was met with overwhelming opposition from his prime minister and other figures. And so the king abdicated on December 10, 1936. He moved to France with Simpson and married her the next year after her second divorce became final.The abdication rocked the concept of the monarchy—and stoked furious curiosity about Simpson. TIME Magazine named her their first Woman of the Year in 1936, and newspapers and magazines eagerly dissected her every move and shamelessly speculated on the most personal details of her life. The New York Sun, for example, bared the news with paparazzi photos of the shirtless king and his bathing-suit-wearing lover playing in the water at Cannes and even consulted medical experts on the possibility of an illicit pregnancy in an article entitled “Stork Rare Caller After 40.”As in the 1930s, public curiosity about Meghan Markle, the divorced American actress turned princess, is seemingly inexhaustible, and tabloid tongues are already wagging after the Sussexes’ shock announcement. But the similarities between Harry and Meghan’s situation likely end there.Harry may be a royal, but he is not a sovereign and is only sixth in line to the British throne. The United Kingdom’s parliament would have to pass a special law to remove him from his distant spot in the line of succession, and as historian Marlene Koenig tells Royal Central, the queen would have to grant him permission to drop the title His Royal Highness.Queen Elizabeth II opens a session of the Parliament of Canada in Ontario with Prince Philip at her side. Britain's reigning monarch is also Canada's head of state, a government structure left over from when the region was under British rule, and the queen has visited Canada more than any other country during her reign.So far, there’s no indication that Prince Harry wants to recuse his title or place in the line of royal sucession. In an FAQ on the couple’s website, they say they intend to “maximize Her Majesty’s legacy” and to “continue to proudly do so” as part of a “new working model” in which they split their time between the UK and North America and step back from their ceremonial roles.The Sussexes plan to continue to use Frogmore Cottage, a property at Windsor Castle where they currently live with the queen's permission, as their official residence, though reports suggest they will likely live in both California and Canada.But unlike Edward, who was given a permanent pension in exchange for his exile in France, Meghan and Harry plan to give up the money they receive from the Sovereign Grant, which British taxpayers give to the monarchy each year. (Harry also receives a much larger amount from Prince Charles' private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall.) Questions remain as to how they will support themselves, though, and it remains to be seen how the couple’s definition of “stepping away” might evolve. Until then, direct comparisons to the abdication crises seem as overblown as Madame Tussauds’ spiteful decision to remove the Sussexes from their royal family display.",
"Angola was heavily mined during decades of civil war. Now, the goverment has partnered with conservationists to clear two national parks in the hopes of attracting wildlife and tourists. Experts with the HALO Trust, a demining organization, painstakingly extract land mines and remotely detonate them.Early one morning in late September, the hum of a metal detector fills the air in a sparse field. A man in a plastic face shield and blue armored vest is crouched near the ground, scanning the wand over a meter-wide lane. He carefully marks the clear path with red-painted sticks: Inside is safe, outside is potentially deadly. He works in a former battlefield in a remote corner of southeastern Angola where rebel troops staged their final clashes at the end of a civil war nearly two decades ago. Today, it’s a heavily mined national park. Peering over the de-miner’s shoulder is Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex.Angola, which spans nearly half a million square miles along Africa’s west coast, was mined during its 27-year civil war. When it ended, in 2002, the country doubled-down on oil production and neglected its vast parks and diverse wildlife. Now, in the wake of falling oil prices, Angola has begun to open to conservationists and tourists. In June, the government pledged $60 million for the first major demining of a protected area. Over the next three years, a demining NGO called HALO Trust, will clear this minefield and 152 others across more than 30,000 square miles in Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga National Parks. The effort will usher in a new era of ecotourism and protection for one of the last and most endangered wild places on Earth.Also at stake is the survival of the Okavango River, which runs from Angola to Botswana and feeds the ecosystem of this part of southern Africa, and the survival of the continent’s famous elephants. If caution isn’t paid, clearing the land of mines could open the parks to poachers and corporations, putting the wildlife and wilderness in more danger. With enough protection, these parks could be one of the few refuges left for wildlife, including those that fled the war years ago. Tourists who take luxurious vacations in neighboring countries could come to safari. But right now, both the animals and tourists know it’s not safe.In September, Prince Harry walked through a recently cleared minefield in Dirico, Angola, following his mother's footsteps in the push for eradication of mines.In 1997, Princess Diana strolled through the city of Huambo, in Angola, which had been heavily mined during the war. This area is now a busy central street.Prince Harry’s visit to Angola was his most personal stop on a whirlwind four-country tour of southern Africa. Twenty-two years ago, his mother, Princess Diana, walked through a cleared minefield in Angola and propelled the issue of landmines, which have killed an estimated 88,000 thousand people in Angola, to the world stage. Later that year, 122 countries signed the Ottawa Treaty, a pact to rid the world of landmines by 2025.The site of her walk, in a city called Huambo, now sports new buildings and a neat row of young trees where there once were mines. Prince Harry’s minefield, an hour-and-a-half flight away, was the scene of the worst battle in Africa since World War II. It’s the most heavily mined province in Angola. Landmines are laid to slow an incoming enemy, but they’re often left in the aftermath and continue to maim and kill long after war ends.Just beyond a sprinkling of trees, government ministers, ambassadors, and wealthy donors crane to see the minefield’s edge and the historic moment: Prince Harry thanked the de-miner, straightened up, and strolled down the newly cleared path, just as his mother had two decades ago. Tall signs sporting skull-and-crossbones and the warning “PERIGO MINAS!” (“Danger mines!”) flanked the way. The pictures would soon be spliced next to the iconic photo of his mother and splashed on front pages across the world, drawing, he hoped, much-needed attention and funds.Starting in the floodplains of Angola, water trickles into two rivers that converge to form the Okavango, which then flows into Namibia and Botswana. The Okavango feeds a tourism industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Angola’s southern neighbor, Botswana. The river has turned the entry city of Maun into the country’s tourism capital. Some 60 lodges and camps cater to the delta’s visitors. Angola—the source of it all—reaps few rewards. The survival of these economies and ecosystems, which about a million people rely on, rests on the protection of the Okavango basin.A day earlier, in Botswana, Harry sat in the backyard of his old friend Dr. Mike Chase, the founder of Elephants Without Borders. Chase lives in Kasane, the gateway to Chobe National Park, and a sign outside his gate reads “Elephant Corridor.” In his yard, he raises orphaned elephants.Earlier that day, the prince had joined an anti-poaching unit who patrol the river dividing Botswana and Namibia for criminal activity. Botswana, with its large swaths of protected land and armed rangers, has long been considered a refuge for elephants. Up to 130,000 savanna elephants call it home—one third of those left on the continent.An African elephant wades into the floodplains of the Okavango River Basin, which feed downstream into the Okavango River. The basin area is currently unprotected. Conservationists warn its preservation is vital for the survival of the ecosystems that rely on the river.Chase was worried. Earlier this year, his organization revealed that Botswana had a poaching problem. Elephants had been killed and their tusks sawed off—likely sold to the Asian market. An aerial survey observed more than a hundred dead elephants around the Okavango delta region; about 90 percent of them had been poached. (These findings have been the source of contention with the conservation community and government).A growing population of elephants, thanks to conservation efforts, has forced some of the five-ton animals out of protected zones. Areas unaccustomed to sharing land with them have come into conflict with the potentially destructive and dangerous creature. To add to the pressure, Botswana lifted its ban on trophy hunting earlier this year, opening up the country to sport hunters. To relieve the pressure on Botswana, Chase believes that 50,000 of Botswana’s elephants should head north—once Angola’s parks are ready to safely house them.The Cuito River converges with the Cubango River in southern Angola to flow into Namibia and Botswana as the Okavango River.“What we would like is for them to do a 180 and turn back north into Angola” Chase said. “Because a lot of our elephants are essentially—”“Refugees.” Prince Harry chimed in. Via satellite collars that track the elephants’ movement, researchers have watched as they reach the open northern border of Botswana and turn back, seemingly sensing danger from the mines and poachers. “You can’t just randomly select the nearest elephants to the Angolan border and say these ones want to go home. The only way to do this is to create that corridor, making sure it’s safe. They won’t go anywhere they know is not safe.”After the war ended in 2002, Angola assessed its damage. Fighting is dangerous for wildlife caught in the crosshairs, but it keeps poachers at bay. As a young researcher, Chase watched as elephants began “a long walk to freedom” from Botswana, through Namibia, and back to Angola just one year after the war, but they were soon chased out again by poachers. He thinks they will return. “I’m confident that Angola is the promised land for Botswana’s wildlife and elephants,” he says. And if not? It’s an ominous sign. “If we can’t save the African elephant what is the future for Africa’s wildlife?”In post-war Angola, it has been hard for environmentalists to compete for funding against other humanitarian issues, from health care to food aid. For years, environmental posts were given to opposition parties and shoved to the backburner, says Vladimir Russo, a leading Angolan environmentalist. Only a handful of environmental education and conservation NGOs remain. But recently, the government has made fresh commitments, including the $60 million demining pledge.Demining, warns Russo, is only the beginning. “If you demine areas and open corridors for animals and people—but there are no patrols—we will see a wipeout of the animals coming back,” says Russo. “Elephants are being killed as we speak.” Effectively protecting wildlife in these remote areas requires well-trained rangers to patrol for poachers, planes, drones, and vehicles that can handle the difficult terrain. Russo believes the Angolan government can’t do it alone—not without buy-in from an international organization like African Parks, which manages embattled parks across the continent. (Learn how elephants are evolving to lose their tusks because of poaching.)The Angolan government is discussing these partnership options as it begins to tackle the southeastern region. At the same time, oil—the country’s main export—has been dropping in price. The government sees this region as a way to diversify their economy with ecotourism. “How we can take a profit without damaging [the environment]?” asks Dr. Paula Coelho, the minister of environment. In September, the government appointed a new agency to ensure the Okavango region is protected and profitable. Dr. Coelho says the region will need everything from renewable energy sources to local education programs to tourist camps.Right now, it is unclear what wildlife remains in these parks. A 2016 study estimated only 10 to 30 lions are left, and there are likely cheetahs, elephants, lions, and other large mammals. A national inventory of wildlife is currently underway, says Dr. Coelho, who was recently surprised to learn that giraffes had moved into the parks.The Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga National Parks, which will be demined over the next three years, are part of the Kavango-Zambezi Trans-Frontier Conservation Area (KAZA). The cross-border initiative, which formed in 2011, spans national parks across five countries and is one of the largest protected areas in the world.“The government [Angolan] is creating conditions so that local communities can start to benefit more directly from wildlife,” says Kai Collins, director of National Geographic’s Okavango Wilderness Project, which has spent five years surveying the ecosystem of the river. Above the two KAZA national parks in Angola is the unheralded and unprotected lifeblood of southern Africa: the greater Okavango basin. This is where the Okavango River begins. Right now, it’s threatened by natural resources extraction, landmines, and new development projects. Animals are being killed for bushmeat and large fires are sweeping across the region. To demine all the minefields around the river systems that feed the delta will require an additional $60 million, Collins says.Prince Harry used his visit to urge his well-heeled international audience not to leave the job of protecting the Okavango half finished. The previous night a few dozen guests had slept in a luxurious tented camp next to the Cuito River, just a few miles away from the minefield. If the evening was a test for tourism, it went smoothly. But without cell reception, the logistics took months to arrange. Right now, the easiest way in—other than private plane—is by taking a boat from Namibia. Inside, the roads are so rough that four-wheel drives have trouble navigating and large trucks are often deployed to rescue them.But it was easy to see the potential for adventure tourism: Visitors slept in tents near the river’s edge, not far from where a nine-foot crocodile had recently been spotted. They ate steak and ice cream trucked in from South Africa and drank beers around a bonfire. With no light pollution, the sky was crammed with stars.The next morning, shortly after walking through the cleared minefield, Prince Harry stood in front of his guests and made a plea: “Just as these rivers extend for miles, so must this project extend far beyond [here],” he said. “Outside of the national parks, large parts of this crucial watershed also need to be cleared of landmines."",
"Seen from space, high above Africa, the Okavango Delta resembles a gigantic starburst blossom pressed onto the landscape of northern Botswana, its stem angling southeastward from the Namibian border, its petals of silvery water splayed out for a hundred miles across the Kalahari Basin. It is one of the planet’s great wetlands, a vast splash of life-nurturing channels and lagoons and seasonal ponds amid a severely dry region of the continent.This delta doesn’t open to the sea. Contained entirely within the basin, it comes to a halt along a southeastern perimeter and disappears into the deep Kalahari sands. It can be thought of as the world’s largest oasis, a wet refuge supporting elephants, hippos, crocodiles, and wild dogs; lechwe and sitatungas and other wetland antelopes; warthogs and buffalo, lions and zebras, and birdlife of wondrous diversity and abundance—not to mention a tourism industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. But from high in space, you won’t see the hippos on their day beds. You won’t see the wild dogs hunkered in shade beneath thorn scrub or the glad expressions on the faces of visitors and local entrepreneurs. Another thing you won’t see is the source of all that water.The water comes almost entirely from Angola, Botswana’s complicated neighbor, two countries away. It begins in the moist highlands of Angola’s rainy center and flows toward the country’s southeast, quickly in one major drainage, the Cubango, and more slowly in another, the Cuito, where it pools into source lakes; percolates slowly through grassy floodplains, peat deposits, and underlying sand; and seeps into tributaries. The Cuito and Cubango Rivers converge at the southern Angolan border, forming a bigger river, the Okavango, which flows across the Caprivi Strip, a narrow band of Namibia, and into Botswana. On average, 2.5 trillion gallons of water a year flows in.Take away that liquid gift, rendered by Angola to Botswana each year, and the Okavango Delta would cease to exist. It would become something else, and that something would not include hippos, sitatungas, or African fish eagles. If southern Africa were a vast golf course, Okavango with the faucets closed would be one of its sand traps.Changes now occurring or foreseeable in southeastern Angola—in land use, water diversion, population density, and commerce—make this dark prospect a real possibility. That’s why the Cuito and Cubango Rivers, two remote waterways, have quietly attained high interest in certain circles. That’s why an international group of scientists, government officials, resource planners, and hardy young explorers, brought together by a fervent South African conservation biologist named Steve Boyes, with support from the National Geographic Society, has embarked on a grand effort of exploration, data gathering, and conservation advocacy called the Okavango Wilderness Project. These collaborators recognize that the well-being and future of the Okavango Delta is at stake—and that the well-being and future of southeastern Angola, a hard landscape, a poor cousin to glorious Okavango, is at stake too.“We’re on borrowed time,” Boyes told me, as we sat at a campsite along the Cubango River earlier this year after a long day of paddling our mokoros (Okavango-style canoes) downstream. Having grown up in Johannesburg, with a passion for nature, Boyes worked for years at various jobs—a bartender at wineries, a naturalist and guide, a camp manager in the Okavango Delta. Along the way he finished a doctorate. By 2007 he had become acutely aware of the water-source issue and tried to raise the alert among people of Botswana but mostly met fatalism.“They were just not interested,” he said, recalling a typical reaction: Yeah, Angola is such a terrible, bad place, and it’s such a shame the river may die. That goaded him to action. He began looking north, toward the headwaters. “We are going to do this,” he vowed. “We’re going to try and understand what this system is about.” In fact he hoped not just to understand it but to help preserve it.Angola in 2017 may seem an unlikely site for visionary conservation efforts, yet it could also offer unusual opportunities. It is ravaged by war but now at peace. From the early 1960s until the start of the new millennium, Angola was high on the list of nations you would not want to visit—unless you were a mercenary soldier or a diamond buyer. Once a Portuguese colony, it got its independence in 1975 after a bloody war of liberation, then was wracked by civil war for 27 years, a proxy battleground for the superpowers, pustulated with land mines, a scene of great suffering and strife.But things have changed drastically since 2002, when the rebel party, UNITA, suffered a crushing defeat, after which oil in great quantities began flowing for export and business boomed. “The most important thing we have to tell the world is that Angola is now a stable country,” the minister of the environment, Maria de Fátima Monteiro Jardim, told me recently at a gathering in Luanda, the capital. “We are committed to preserving nature,” she said. What that commitment will mean to reality on the ground is a crucial unknown.The Boyes team has the blessing of Angolan officialdom, along with international support, to pursue an extraordinarily ambitious study of the Cuito and Cubango Rivers, exploring every mile of them and some of their tributaries, surveying their wildlife, sampling water quality, noting human presence and impacts along the banks, creating a vast and publicly accessible body of data, and trying to comprehend just how the clean waters of southeastern Angola vivify the Okavango Delta in Botswana.These survey expeditions, eight so far, have been arduous as well as thorough. The first began on May 21, 2015, when Boyes and his team, traveling with an escort of Land Rovers from HALO Trust, the international demining organization, and a big Russian cargo truck, arrived at the source lake of the Cuito River. They had brought several tons of gear and seven mokoros in which to ferry themselves and their stuff downstream. After paddling the length of the lake on their first day, they discovered that the Cuito at its outlet is a tiny stream, waist-deep but only a yard or so wide, and impossible for navigation by 20-foot-long mokoros. So they dragged the loaded boats downstream, slogging through high grasses alongside the little band of water, pulling like human oxen, and taking data as they went. These mokoros were fiberglass-and-wood models, not dugouts of ebony or some other tree like the Okavango originals, but were still very weighty when fully loaded. They dragged them each day for more than a week before the Cuito became navigable. Then they climbed aboard, with paddles and poles, but faced a new sort of challenge: crocodiles and hippos.The Cuito along its upper reaches is essentially a wilderness river—clear water, banks lined with reeds, no villages, few signs of humans. On the morning of July 11, 2015, along a broad curve, something plunged through the reeds and into the water just ahead. Boyes, steersman in the lead boat, hollered “Croc,” a relatively routine alert. He ruddered toward the mid-river channel, giving the animal space along the bank.Suddenly a great bulge of water rose beside Boyes’s boat as a distraught hippo surfaced—probably a young male, Boyes thinks. Turns out the right evasive line for a crocodile is the wrong one for a hippo. Hippos own the deep water. And like crocs, they may kill hundreds of people each year. “It was a big mistake,” Boyes told me later. “Completely our fault. We went right over the animal, defending itself.”The hippo drove its lower canine teeth (maybe a foot and a half long, and sharp) through the bottom of the boat. The upper jaw didn’t quite catch the gunwale, so instead of biting the mokoro in half, the hippo just capsized the thing, sending Boyes and his bow paddler, Giles Trevethick, into the water. They clambered onto the hull, and a crew member quickly fired a bear-banger flare, meant to disrupt the attack. Boyes’s younger brother Chris, his expedition chief, in a boat just behind, shouted “Swim!” Boyes and Trevethick got to shore, safe but shaken. Within two hours the boat was patched—using their fiberglass-repair kit—and the expedition was back on the water.What’s telling from this episode, besides the fast recovery, is how it exemplifies the Okavango Wilderness Project’s harvest of data. From the observations gathered that hour, by electronic device and human eyeball, recorded instantly into an elaborate data-vacuuming system, we know that the Cuito River thereabouts has a strong current, a sandy bottom, and not much aquatic vegetation but harbors smallmouth bream, among other fish. We know that Trevethick made note of a pied kingfisher, then a malachite kingfisher, then a blacksmith lapwing, perched on shoreline limbs. We know the longitude and latitude at which the mishap occurred, to at least 12 decimal points of GPS accuracy. We know that Steve Boyes’s pulse rate (as registered by his Suunto watch, also patched to the system) rose abruptly from 81 beats a minute to 208 beats a minute at 10:57 a.m. And we can assume that 208 is the normal heart rate for a healthy young man trying to outswim the watery gallop of a hippopotamus.When I joined Boyes’s team on the Cubango River, almost two years later, their data-gathering regimen had advanced to include more categories of information. One morning I watched a young Namibian named Götz Neef assess his overnight catch in a fish trap: A largemouth bream, an electric elephantfish of the sort called a Churchill, a squeaker catfish, and more—weird creatures to me, subtle data points of biogeography to anyone who knows African fish. Such sampling and collections, analyzed by ichthyologists allied with the project, will help reveal how the fish fauna of the Cubango differ from that of the Cuito and how both may contain unique species or subspecies, distinct from anything else in the region.Along the Cuito, for instance, the researchers found what may be a new species of Clariallabes, an eel-like form of air-breathing catfish that seems adapted for wriggling through the saturated peat bogs. Other specialists, based in Angola, South Africa, and England, have also assisted the project with field collections—of amphibians, reptiles, insects, small mammals, plants—and continue the work of identification and analysis. Frogs and dragonflies, with their aquatic immature stages, are sensitive to pollution and can be especially telling as indicators of water quality. One group of peculiar rodents, known as vlei rats in the Afrikaans slang (suggesting that they inhabit transient ponds, or vleis) and notable for the smallness of their territories, seems to have diversified into more than one related species in the highlands.“Angola is the missing link,” a small-mammal biologist named Peter Taylor, one of the project’s experts, told me, “for understanding the pattern of radiation of these beasts.” Boyes’s goal is to assemble such facts into a mosaic portrait of this two-river system, in its biological and hydrological particulars, to support protecting it for its own sake and the sake of the Okavango Delta.Neef, besides trapping fish, also saw to the gathering of water-quality data from two delicate sensors as we paddled downstream. And he saw to the continuous photography—one 360-degree camera on a tripod, plus two DSLRs angled out from the bow of his mokoro, snapping frames at five-minute intervals. In the evenings at camp, as darkness fell, Neef deployed a bat detector, a little yellow box that captured high-frequency blurts of chiropterans, used later to identify the species. Other expedition members recorded data about birds, reptiles, human activity. Boyes himself was the principal ornithologist on the rivers, calling out sightings—giant kingfisher, hammerkop, white-fronted bee-eater, lilac-breasted roller—which a young Angolan biologist, Kerllen Costa, entered with GPS tagging into a tablet. Costa’s sister, Adjany, is an ichthyologist and a National Geographic emerging explorer; also assistant director of the project, she serves as liaison to Angolan officials when she isn’t aboard one of the expedition’s mokoros. Boyes’s team also includes field crew members from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, the U.S., and of course, Botswana, homeland of his most skilled mokoro boatmen, recruited from the Okavango Delta itself.Captain of my mokoro was Tumeletso Setlabosha, known to everyone as Water, a small but powerful Wayeyi man who grew up in the central delta. His mother gave him the aqueous nickname because his birth occurred in a pool of water, when she was traveling through the lagoons. Asked his age, Water said he was 54 on land, but “when I’m paddling, I’m 25.” He tolerated me in the bow of his boat for a week, as I gawked and scribbled notes and did my best with the paddle.The hooves and dung of buffalo churn and fertilize solid ground. In the changeable Okavango, life shapes landscape and vice versa.Human presence along the upper Cubango is sparse, even though the end of the war has allowed people to return to their villages in these southern hinterlands once controlled by the UNITA rebels. Paddling between reed-lined banks, we saw the occasional beached mokoro, the lonely fishing camp, the cow here, the goat there, a few women washing clothes or making moonshine (kashipembe) from jackal berries or other wild fruit in a simple still—and then, farther downstream, more people, more boats, more livestock, corn crops, a soccer field, a few motorbikes. At night, beyond the trill of crickets, we heard the roar of trucks, and the clatter of their springs taking washboard at full speed, on a bad but important dirt track paralleling the river. That road leads to a border crossing with Namibia, through which supplies can roll in and Angolan timber can roll out. Apart from timber and illegal bush meat and water, the Cubango Valley has little to offer the wider world. No one, it seems, has yet found diamonds or gold or oil in this corner of Angola. Clean water: That is the oil and the gold.One day about noon we beached on the left bank above a small rapid, and because a fully loaded mokoro is too fragile and clumsy for white-water daring, we scouted the line. As we walked, Boyes spotted a hippo snare of stout wire, camouflaged with reed stems and placed along a haul-out path used by the animals. There is nothing more piteous than the howl of a hippo in a snare, he said, and clipped through the wire with his utility tool. Boyes has deep sympathy for the needs of people along the Cubango, and he recognizes that their progress toward better lives must be part of any arrangement for protecting the two rivers, the water flow, the biological riches of southeastern Angola, and the Okavango Delta. But hippo flesh for meat and hippo teeth to be sold as ivory are contraband commodities that the Cubango can’t sustainably surrender.Another day, we came off the water early to avoid camping near a village called Savate, a place known for the land mines still lurking around its perimeter. We beached upstream, at a dirt landing where it was cow pies, not mines, we had to avoid. Children watched us unload tons of gear—tents and tables and boxes of food, duffels, folding stools, fancy electronics. Women came with piles of washing to this, their regular laundry spot, and had to work around our flotilla of canoes. A tethered donkey grazed nearby. A donkey was wealth. After sunset, by the time our hearty dinner of beans and rice came off the campfire, smelling good, the children had disappeared. I wondered what impression of us they took.Seen from a Cessna, 500 feet above northern Botswana, the Okavango Delta resembles a paisley carpet of ovals and streaks and patches, gentle rises and swales, a rich pattern textured largely in shades of green and brown. The lagoon waters appear almost black from overhead; the channels and oxbows gleam silver when reflecting a low afternoon sun. At the center of small islands, ringed by trees, lies the whiteness of precipitated salt. Aloft in your little plane, and moving slowly, you get a sense of the dynamic heterogeneity below, of how water has nudged and carved and shaped land over time, opening new channels, closing old ones, rising and falling by season, filling pans, then leaving them to dry, encircling islands, respecting subtle ridges, changing its imperatives and benefices from year to year, and thereby shaping an extraordinary ecosystem hospitable to fish and crocodiles and long-legged birds and mammals that don’t mind having wet feet. That’s how I saw the delta, after my time in Angola, thanks to John “Tico” McNutt, a veteran American conservation biologist.McNutt, a friend of a friend, met me at the small airport in Maun serving Okavango tourism and flew us to the research camp from which he has worked for nearly three decades, studying the endangered African wild dog. With his breadth of curiosity and involvement, he probably understands the ecological and political dynamics of the delta as well as anyone. Besides showing me dog packs on the ground, he gave me four days of eye-in-the-sky perspective and commentary—even while flying the plane and listening for his collared dogs on the VHF telemetry receiver.On the left, that’s Chief’s Island. On the right, the old Mogogelo floodplain, which once carried water almost all the way to his camp. We gazed down at large herds of lechwe, some reedbuck and impalas, termite mounds rising cream-colored at the center of small islands, hippo tracks like claw marks across the floodplain grasses, elephants casting long shadows in late afternoon. “There’s no vultures,” he remarked. “They should be roosting in these palm groves—should be vultures all over.” But vultures are hated by poachers for giving away the positions of fresh elephant carcasses and are killed by poisoning the left-behind meat. The Okavango, even with the taps open, has its problems.We flew north across low plains of reeds and papyrus, islands large and small, serpentine channels, until McNutt said: “Somewhere right here would be the fault line, where everything starts to distribute. From the panhandle.”The panhandle is a wide stretch of slow-moving water, contained by ridges that rise above swampy lowlands, beginning just south of the Namibia border and flowing southeast to that line McNutt mentioned, known to geologists as the Gumare Fault. Beyond the fault line lies a sunken, flat trough, partly filled with sediments but still nearly the lowest zone in the Kalahari Basin, across which the Okavango waters spread broadly into their flower-blossom shape. The blossom petals come to a dead stop, though, at another pair of diagonal faults, marking the southeastern boundary of the delta. Meeting those natural dams, what remains of the surface water slides westward into a linear lake, Lake Ngami, or sinks away into the sands. South of all this: salt pans and desert.Amid the complexities of water delivery and biological enrichment, from the headwaters to the delta, from Angola through the Caprivi Strip to Botswana, several factors are especially fateful. The delta itself receives rainfall but not much, and mostly during the summer months of December through March. Angola’s central highlands receive far more, a great wet bounty, roughly 50 inches annually, which saturates the peat deposits and sands of the upper Cuito floodplains and then slowly, after delay, flows down the Cuito and its tributaries. Those rains feed the Cubango too, but the Cubango River catchment lies on steeper, rockier substrate, so the seasonal rainwater comes gushing down fast.The result of these asynchronies is that the Okavango Delta gets three separate pulses of water annually, giving it a longer and more varied supply of moisture than most freshwater wetlands enjoy. Freshwater coming in pulses, spread across the year, distributed in an ever changing pattern of channels and pans and lagoons, nurturing vegetation of many types, fertilized by the dung of elephants and hippos and impalas—all this is a good recipe for biological fecundity.The biggest challenge faced by the Okavango Wilderness Project is not just to understand this complex system—that’s hard enough—but to persuade Angolan officialdom, and the Angolan people, to preserve the Cuito and Cubango Rivers roughly as they are, flowing free and clean, without much pollution or diversion, through landscapes mostly undamaged by timber harvest, charcoalmaking, forest burning for hunting drives, commercial extraction of bush meat, agricultural schemes demanding high inputs of fertilizer, mining, or other destructive uses. It’s an urgent task and not an easy one.Some optimists propose that landscapes along the Cuito and Cubango could become international tourism destinations themselves, sites of high-end lodges drawing visitors to see restored populations of magnificent wildlife, such as the Angolan giant sable, that were mostly lost during the decades of war. Maybe such attractions could be included in a regional circuit, they suggest, along with more famous camps in the Okavango. Another hope is that the Botswana government and its tourism industry might recognize the jeopardy of their wonderland—recognize that without the Cuito and the Cubango, there is no Okavango Delta—and act with foresight, offering a compact of payments to Angola for continued delivery of the water. Call it ransom or call it a “water bond” (as Steve Boyes does), it seems rational. Rationality and foresight might be improbable expectations when it comes to intergovernmental relations over resource issues, but the Okavango Delta itself is an improbable phenomenon deserving exceptional concern, imagination, and effort.Meanwhile the changes in Angola, as Boyes told me, are happening fast. “If we started this work in three years’ time, there’d be nothing left to protect.” The future is coming like a river that flows through other people’s lives.",
"Botswana, which has a strong history of wildlife conservation, is home to about a third of Africa’s savanna elephants.Botswana—widely considered a safe haven for elephants in Africa—appears to be suffering from its own surge in poaching, according to aerial survey work published today in the journal Current Biology.“We have a significant poaching problem—let’s deal with it,” says Mike Chase, who, as the director of the Botswana-based nonprofit Elephants Without Borders, led the latest aerial survey study as well as earlier elephant counts, including the 18-country Great Elephant Census. “We were warned by conservationists in other countries that the poachers would eventually come down to Botswana, and now they’re here,” he says.Botswana is estimated to be home to more than 130,000 savanna elephants—about a third of Africa’s remaining population. Until recently, the southern African country had largely escaped the scourge of elephant killings for ivory, still in high demand in China and elsewhere. (Read about how elephants fleeing poaching hotspots went to Botswana.)Elephants Without Borders says that carcasses with extensive skull damage and the tusks removed, like this one in a remote area of Botswana, were likely poached for ivory.In Chase’s 2014 survey work, his team saw no incidents of suspected elephant poaching in Botswana. But in 2018, across five areas, they counted 156 fresh or recent carcasses whose skulls had been cut open and the tusks removed. Many of the carcasses were hidden under bushes, suggesting, Chase says, that those animals were victims of the illegal ivory trade.Elephants Without Borders estimates that country-wide at least 385 elephants were poached from 2017 through early October 2018—a spike that may portend future population declines. This, Chase says, should be seen as a call to action.The African Wildlife Foundation, an international conservation nonprofit, estimates that as many as 35,000 elephants are killed each year in Africa. Zambia’s Sioma Ngwezi National Park, for example, had about 900 elephants in 2004 but only an estimated 48 just over a decade later—losses likely driven by ivory poaching. And in the Ruaha-Rungwa region of south-central Tanzania, the elephant population is estimated to have fallen from more than 34,000 in 2009 to 8,000 by 2014.The Botswana count in Current Biology appears on the heels of last month’s announcement by the government that it will lift its five-year-old hunting ban on all species—a controversial move that will allow renewed trophy hunts of elephants and other animals. Such hunts, the government said, are needed because dangerous encounters between people and elephants have been increasing and may threaten livelihoods, among other reasons.The paper follows an earlier iteration of the findings in a 2018 report by Elephants Without Borders. That work—reviewed by other scientists and funded and released independently—had been dismissed by the Botswana government and some scientists as an overestimation of the poaching problem.“Our main conclusion remains the same [as last year’s report], but we decided the best thing to do was take all of our results, make sure we had done everything correctly, and put it together in a paper that went through the journal’s formal peer-review process—which is about as good as you can get in the scientific world,” says Scott Schlossberg, an Elephants Without Borders ecologist who led the analysis. The hope, he says, is that people will now be convinced about the scale of this problem.Botswana’s Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism did not respond to requests for comment about elephant poaching in the country.To conduct the counts, Chase flew in a small, single-engine plane, sitting alongside the pilot and recording carcass sightings. Two observers sat in the back doing their own counts—one of whom was almost always a Botswana government employee, according to Elephants Without Borders. They followed up with helicopter and photo inspections of some carcasses.Whether or not Botswana’s hunting ban helped deter poachers or, as some assert, led to unchecked elephant numbers—perhaps making villagers feel justified in killing elephants that damaged their crops and then taking their tusks—remains unclear, says crime and security expert Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Felbab-Brown considers the findings in Current Biology “credible” and “strengthened” from a year ago. “This work looks solid,” she says.Gaseitsiwe Masunga, an ecologist at the University of Botswana’s Okavango Research Institute and a former chief wildlife officer for Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks, also accepts the findings. “I think the extrapolations here are reasonable,” he says, adding, “I think it is accurate and correct that the number of poaching incidents is increasing.” Moreover, Masunga says, earlier ground-based surveys indicated that poaching numbers were on the rise, and aerial work allows for even greater perspective.But Goemeone Mogomotsi, a senior research fellow at the Okavango Research Institute, wrote in an email that he’s skeptical about the Elephants Without Borders methodology and numbers. Many of the de-tusked elephant carcasses, he says, may have been animals that died from natural causes and then were de-tusked by government employees—a relatively common practice. “That is done on a regular basis when elephants die, and their carcasses are identified by anti-poaching units,” he says. “To take out those tusks, a similar process of hacking the skulls is likely carried out.”Both Chase and Masunga, however, say that anti-poaching units don’t conceal carcasses and typically indicate their removal of tusks by marking the carcasses with spray paint. It would also be unusual—too demanding logistically—for anti-poaching units to de-tusk elephants in the remote areas where these elephants were found, Chase says. He adds that it isn’t typical for anti-poaching units to de-tusk new carcasses; instead, they take tusks from old, decomposed carcasses.Publishing the new findings in a peer-reviewed journal is also about vindication, Chase says. “To have your scientific reputation called into question is soul-destroying. I’m hoping this paper will in some way restore my reputation as a well-known elephant conservationist and, more importantly, help with the plight of elephants in our country and restore our legacy of being a safe haven for the world’s largest elephant population."In addition to exhaustively cross-checking their earlier work, Schlossberg, Chase, and co-author Robert Sutcliffe added one new element. To test for other possible causes of elephant deaths, they studied the regions immediately surrounding the five poaching hot spots to ascertain whether they differed from the hot spots in terms of available food for elephants, drought conditions, elephant densities, and numbers of people.What they found was that the non-poached areas generally had poorer food supplies and less water. Elephant densities were roughly comparable, and there were more people in the areas outside the poaching hot spots. They concluded that these factors don’t explain the deaths of the elephants and that poaching is the more likely cause.Overall, the team estimated that between 2014 and 2018 the number of elephant carcasses in Botswana increased by 593 percent. Some of the increase may have been from natural causes, including a country-wide drought a few years ago, Schlossberg says. Elephant numbers stayed roughly stable from 2014 to 2018. But that in itself is problematic, he explains, because elephant populations are expected to increase a few percentage points every year, unless something keeps those numbers in check, such as drought or disease—or poaching.“We don’t want to say poaching has caused the population to stop growing—we don’t have enough evidence to claim that—but it is worrisome when an elephant population is not growing,” he says.The carcass evidence suggests that poachers in Botswana have concentrated on tuskers, the older bulls most likely to have the largest tusks. Once those elephants are gone, poachers turn to the matriarchs. At that point, Schlossberg says, elephant populations are especially vulnerable because the older females are the repositories of the herd’s collective wisdom. The matriarchs are the ones who know where to find water and food. (Learn more about ivory poaching trends: Under poaching pressure, elephants are evolving to lose their tusks.)“It has become easy to believe that Botswana was always going to be safe for elephants, even if it was going really badly for elephants in other countries around Botswana,” Schlossberg says. “But now we know that it is not.”Chase says that to protect Botswana’s elephants, “we cannot expect government to deal with these complex challenges on their own.” Some poaching hot spots are in concessions leased to large international tourism or safari companies, and they should ramp up their own anti-poaching efforts. Chase points to two concessions in the Okavango Delta that have anti-poaching patrols—in those highly monitored areas, Elephants Without Borders found no elephants that had been killed for their ivory.",
"African elephants continue to be poached for their tusks. New data show that boosting law enforcement alone won’t be enough to save them. Reducing poverty is also essential to protecting Earth’s largest land mammal.Severin Hauenstein had a hunch. The biologist from Germany's University of Freiburg suspected that there was a link between the places where elephants in Tanzania were killed for their ivory and the visible presence of law enforcement.He thought that the carcasses of poached elephants would generally cluster farther away from anti-poaching ranger posts. When he and his colleagues crunched the data for the once elephant-rich Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem, they were surprised to find no correlation at all.But then they took a closer look. For most ranger stations, the pattern was consistent with their expectations. But for others, they found the opposite: Carcasses were found quite close to ranger posts. That led to a second hunch—that the rangers stationed at those posts were complicit in poaching.Elephant losses in Ruaha-Rungwa, in south-central Tanzania, had been staggering. Authorities estimated that the population fell from more than 34,000 in 2009 to just 8,000 by 2014.The findings led Hauenstein and his colleagues to the realization that poaching patterns can't always be understood at a continental scale, or even at a regional one. Instead, they thought that the likelihood that elephant poaching would occur in any given place might be related, at least in part, to local considerations. (Learn more about how under poaching pressure elephants are evolving to lose their tusks.)That's why Hauenstein, together with collaborators from the University of York, in the U.K., and the United Nations Environment Programme, decided to compare annual poaching rates at 53 different sites in sub-Saharan Africa with information about local environmental, economic, social, and political factors. Their analysis appears today in the journal Nature Communications.The researchers identified two variables that influence local poaching rates more than expected. One is poverty, as measured by infant mortality rate, derived from data provided by Columbia University's Centre for International Earth Science Information Network and the UN. The other is corruption, as measured by the NGO Transparency International."What was particularly interesting was that both poverty and corruption correlated more strongly with local levels of poaching than [did] the adequacy of law enforcement," Hauenstein says. Poaching levels were assessed by experts under a program called Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE), which provides data to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the body that regulates cross-border trade in wildlife."To us, it looks like it isn't possible to just increase law enforcement more and more and solve the problem," Hauenstein says, although he’s quick to emphasize that this doesn’t mean law enforcement shouldn't remain a priority—"just that there are other things that need to be addressed." In other words, there are places where it may be prudent to focus more on alleviating poverty or reducing corruption.While these findings may seem self-evident, efforts to reduce poaching largely remain focused on law enforcement, Hauenstein says.An elephant in Samburu National Reserve in Kenya stands tall among her herd.In rural Africa, many strategies and projects exist to alleviate poverty, but community development projects can sometimes subvert conservation goals, says George Wittemyer, a Colorado State University biologist. Wittemyer is also a member of the African Elephants Specialist Group for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the body that sets the conservation status of species, and serves as the scientific chair for the NGO Save the Elephants."If you put in water, or education, or health services right next to wilderness areas, that inevitably leads to pressure on that wilderness area," he explains. And if you build capacity in agriculture or livestock husbandry, then what was once wildlife habitat could be converted for other uses, simultaneously increasing the risk of destructive and potentially deadly encounters between people and wild animals.Establishing tourism-related infrastructure is often suggested as an economic engine that could benefit wildlife as well as people, both through photographic safaris and through tightly managed big-game hunting. Hauenstein says it isn’t clear that money flowing in from these ventures always helps the people otherwise most tempted to resort to poaching.But there are places where this model seems effective. In Namibia, the 23-year-old Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program—which transferred rights over natural resources, including wildlife, to local communities and established their legal rights to develop tourism and hunting operations—is often characterized as beneficial for wildlife as well as people.Elephant researchers reporting to CITES have found that average mortality levels owing to poaching across all 53 sites fell from a peak of 10 percent in 2011 to less than 4 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the IUCN reports that African elephant numbers are increasing. (Of the threats facing elephants, habitat loss and fragmentation, and consequent human-elephant conflicts, still tops the list.)Hauenstein says both trends seem to reflect the better condition of savanna elephants in eastern and southern Africa but that poaching risk remains high for forest elephants, found in western and central Africa. And to the extent that reductions in poaching are connected to the recent economic slowdown in China, that pattern could quite easily reverse itself, he says. "The crisis is not over."The future of African elephants is inextricably linked to the well-being of the continent’s rural people. They often must suffer the costs of living with large, dangerous animals without deriving much if any benefit from that coexistence. Perhaps solving the elephant crisis means treating it as an issue of human rights and social justice, says Maxi Louis, director of the Namibian Association of CBNRM Support Organizations, rather than solely one of wildlife conservation.",
"Elephants with a rare “tuskless” genetic trait had a better chance of surviving Mozambique’s long civil war, financed in part by poached ivory. About a third of surviving elephants’ daughters have no tusks.The oldest elephants wandering Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park bear the indelible markings of the civil war that gripped the country for 15 years: Many are tuskless. They’re the lone survivors of a conflict that killed about 90 percent of these beleaguered animals, slaughtered for ivory to finance weapons and for meat to feed the fighters.Hunting gave elephants that didn’t grow tusks a biological advantage in Gorongosa. Recent figures suggest that about a third of younger females—the generation born after the war ended in 1992—never developed tusks. Normally, tusklessness would occur only in about 2 to 4 percent of female African elephants.Decades ago, some 4,000 elephants lived in Gorongosa, says Joyce Poole—an elephant behavior expert and National Geographic Explorer who studies the park’s pachyderms. But those numbers dwindled to triple digits following the civil war. New, as yet unpublished, research she’s compiled indicates that of the 200 known adult females, 51 percent of those that survived the war—animals 25 years or older—are tuskless. And 32 percent of the female elephants born since the war are tuskless.A male elephant’s tusks are bigger and heavier than those of a female of the same age, says Poole, who serves as scientific director of a nonprofit called ElephantVoices. “But once there’s been heavy poaching pressure on a population, then the poachers start to focus on the older females as well,” she explains. “Over time, with the older age population, you start to get this really higher proportion of tuskless females.”This tuskless trend isn’t limited to Mozambique, either. Other countries with a history of substantial ivory poaching also see similar shifts among female survivors and their daughters. In South Africa, the effect has been particularly extreme—fully 98 percent of the 174 females in Addo Elephant National Park were reportedly tuskless in the early 2000s.This tuskless matriarch moves with her herd across Gorongosa’s floodplain.“The prevalence of tusklessness in Addo is truly remarkable and underscores the fact that high levels of poaching pressure can do more than just remove individuals from a population,” says Ryan Long, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Idaho and a National Geographic Explorer. The “consequences of such dramatic changes in elephant populations are only just beginning to be explored.”Josephine Smit, who studies elephant behavior as a researcher with the Southern Tanzania Elephant Program, says that among the female elephants she tracks at Ruaha National Park, an area that was heavily poached in the 1970s and 1980s, 21 percent of females older than five are tuskless. As in Gorongosa, the numbers are highest among older females. About 35 percent of females older than 25 are tuskless, she says. And among elephants ages five to 25, 13 percent of females are tuskless. (Smit, a doctoral candidate at the University of Stirling, in Scotland, says the data have not yet been published, though she presented the findings at a scientific wildlife conference last December.)Poaching has also pushed tusk sizes down in some heavily hunted areas, such as southern Kenya. A 2015 study conducted by Duke University and the Kenya Wildlife Service compared the tusks of elephants captured there between 2005 and 2013 with those of elephants culled between 1966 and 1968 (that is, before significant poaching took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s) and found significant differences. Survivors of that period of intense poaching had much smaller tusks—they were about a fifth smaller in males and more than a third smaller in females.The pattern repeated in their offspring. On average, male elephants born after 1995 had tusks 21 percent smaller than the males from the 1960s, and 27 percent smaller than the females from that period. According to the study’s authors, “although our evidence for the role of genetics on tusk size is indirect,” studies of mice, baboons, and humans have similarly established that incisor size—homologous to a tusk in elephants—is heritable and has “substantial genetic influence.”A tuskless adult female elephant in the Gorongosa National Park woodlands has been fitted with a GPS collar so researchers can track her movements and better understand her behavior.Despite the wave of human-influenced tusklessness in recent decades, elephants missing their tusks are surviving and appear healthy, according to Poole. Scientists say that the significant proportion of elephants with this handicap may be altering how individuals and their broader communities behave, and they want to find out if, for example, these animals have larger home ranges than other elephants because they might need to cover more ground to find recoverable foods.Tusks are essentially overgrown teeth. Yet they’re typically used for most tasks of daily living: digging for water or vital minerals in the ground, debarking trees to secure fibrous food, and helping males compete for females.The work elephants do with their tusks is vital for other animals too. Elephants’ “role as a keystone species to topple trees and dig holes to access water is important for a variety of lower species that depend on them,” Long says. Tusk action also helps create habitats. Certain lizards, for example, prefer to make their homes in trees roughed up or knocked over by browsing elephants.If elephants are changing where they live, how quickly they move, or where they go, it could have larger implications for the ecosystems around them. “Any or all of these changes in behavior could result in changes to the distribution of elephants across the landscape, and it’s those broad-scale changes that are most likely to have consequences for the rest of the ecosystem,” Long says.Now, Long and a team of ecology and genetic researchers are starting to study how tuskless elephants are navigating their lives. In June, the team started tracking six adult females in Gorongosa—half with tusks, half not—from three different breeding herds. They fitted them with GPS collars, took blood and dung samples, and plan to monitor them for a couple of years—or until the battery life in each of the collars gives out—periodically taking more fecal samples to analyze the elephants’ diet.Elephants are highly social and form tight family groups. Here, a family enjoys time together at Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve.Their goal is to uncover more information about how these animals move, eat, and what their genomes look like. Long hopes to detail how elephants without the benefit of tusks as tools may alter their behavior to get access to nutrients. Rob Pringle, at Princeton University, plans to look at dung samples for insights about both diet and the army of microbes and parasites that live inside each elephant’s gut. Another collaborator, Shane Campbell-Staton, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California Los Angeles, will study blood, searching for answers about how genetics influences the phenomenon of tusklessness.Exactly how this trait is inherited is “puzzling,” Campbell-Staton says. Tusklessness does seem to occur disproportionately among females. It makes sense that tuskless males wouldn’t be able to compete for breeding access to female elephants, he says. But if this trait was traditionally X-linked—passed down along the X chromosome, which helps determine sex and carries genes for various inherited traits—we would think that because males always get their X chromosome from their mothers that you’d have a really large population of males that are tuskless. “But we don’t see that. Tuskless males are extremely rare in African elephants,” he says.Joyce Poole corroborates this. She says that in her entire career she’s seen only three or four tuskless males—none of them in Gorongosa.Although tuskless elephants’ nutritional and behavioral characteristics haven’t yet been formally compared to those of tusked elephants in any herd, Smit says anecdotally that in her research she’s seen that elephants without tusks appear to have found work-arounds.“I’ve observed tuskless elephants feeding on bark, and they’re able to strip bark with their trunks, and sometimes they use their teeth.” They may also be relying on other elephants’ inadvertent help, she says. Perhaps the elephants are targeting different kinds of trees that are easier to strip, or trees that have already had some stripping by other elephants—giving them a prepared leverage point for tearing off bark.Recent bans on the ivory trade in China and the U.S. may help reduce demand for tusks, but exactly how long it could take a population with a high proportion of tusklessness to recover some of its numbers—and its tuskedness—varies. Among Asian elephants, for example, a long history of hunting for ivory—as well as removing tusked elephants from the wild for labor—likely helped contribute to higher tuskless numbers there.“If you look at Asian elephants, females don’t have tusks at all, and depending on which population you look at in which country, most males are also often tuskless,” Poole explains. Exactly why the Asian and African elephant populations have such different rates of tusklessness remains unexplained.Yet Poole and others note that in areas in Asia that historically have been targeted for ivory hunts, tuskless levels are high—just as in Africa—underscoring that humans are leaving a lasting mark on Earth’s largest land mammal.",
"A German hunter kills an old bull elephant in Namibia. There is a long-running debate as to whether and how trophy hunting benefits conservation.After a five-year suspension, the government of Botswana has decided once again to allow sport hunters to kill elephants, according to a statement issued on May 22 by the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resource Conservation and Tourism.Botswana is home to more than 130,000 elephants—about a third of Africa’s remaining savanna elephants—and it appeared to have largely escaped the recent ivory poaching crisis. Continent-wide elephant numbers dropped by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census, an 18-country aerial elephant count conducted by Elephants Without Borders that was completed in 2016 and funded by Vulcan.While hunting elephants is now legal in Botswana, American sport hunters may not rush there because it’s unlikely they’d be able to bring their trophies home. In 2017, a controversy erupted after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided to lift the ban on elephant trophy imports from Zimbabwe and Zambia. After President Donald Trump tweeted his dissatisfaction with the decision, the Fish and Wildlife Service reversed course and decided to evaluate all applications to import elephant trophies from all countries on a case-by-case basis. Since then, no permits have been issued.In June 2018, the government of Botswana put together a committee to advise on whether the trophy hunting ban should be lifted. Implemented in 2014 under then-President Ian Khama, the goal was to better conserve species like elephants. “There was little accountability from the community trusts” managing hunting at the time, said Elephants without Borders director Mike Chase, in an interview with National Geographic this February, when the proposal was being debated. “The villagers didn’t benefit from the hunting quota and the fees that the hunters were paying.”Nonetheless, the committee—which included local authorities, NGOs, researchers, industry representatives, and others—found that “there is a negative impact of the hunting suspension on livelihoods, particularly for community-based organizations” that were previously benefiting from hunting.It also found that the Department of Wildlife and National Parks was taking too long to intervene and control destructive elephants, which can destroy a season’s worth of crops in a single night.“The general consensus from those consulted was that the hunting ban should be lifted,” the statement says. “On the basis of these issues, the Government has reflected and assessed the recommendations, and lifted the suspension.”“We can have a sustainable quota, which will have negligible impact on the population,” Chase said. “But you have to weigh that up and consider the international backlash...and how that may undermine our economy, our jobs, and our reputation for being at the forefront of conservation.”Still, he empathizes with the communities that face the brunt of elephant damage and have advocated for the reinstatement of hunting. He notes that elephants’ range has expanded dramatically in Botswana because drought has caused them to wander farther in search of water, meaning they’re coming into contact with humans more often.“Sharing their lives with a five-ton animal that threatens their lives, destroys their crops, damages their properties—I share their anguish,” he said. “When you’ve tried all kinds of alternatives...and they’re still dangerous, the animal has to be destroyed. At least the communities should be able to benefit by letting a hunter come in and pay to do it,” he said in February.Khama has criticized the move as purely political, intended to shore up rural votes ahead of the October election.Elephants are highly social and form tight family groups. Here, a family enjoys time together at Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve.Dan Ashe, the head of the Fish and Wildlife Service during the Obama administration and now the president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, says that while he personally doesn’t like the idea of hunting elephants for sport, it’s important to recognize Botswana’s authority to regulate its own wildlife.“Botswana always enjoyed a very good standing with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and a reputation for professional management and relatively corruption-free government,” he says, adding that when he ran the service, “we had a professional confidence in Botswana.”Many conservationists are opposed to elephant hunting, both because of the decreasing number of elephants continent-wide and because of ethical concerns—there is no doubt that elephants are capable of empathy and emotion.Hunting will be reinstated “in an orderly and ethical manner” with more details to come, the government statement says.",
"It seems that many of the recently killed elephants recently had been targeted by poachers as they approached watering holes, says Mike Chase, of Elephants Without Borders.At least 87 elephants have been killed for their ivory in Botswana in recent months, according to the conservation nonprofit Elephants Without Borders, which discovered the carcasses. It’s a sharp and disturbing increase in poaching for a country that has been considered elephants’ last stronghold in Africa, says Mike Chase, the organization’s director.“It came as a complete shock that we were discovering elephants that were poached deep within Botswana, within some world-renowned tourist concessions,” he says. “It was completely unexpected.”Elephants Without Borders was conducting aerial surveys for the Botswana government when observers began noticing carcasses around the Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage region far from the Namibian and Zimbabwean borders where poaching incidents have occurred more commonly in the country. The organization conducts an elephant census for the government every four years. The most recent census, in 2014, found nine recently killed elephants. This year’s survey, which is only halfway complete, has already found 87.Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks today issued a statement saying the Elephants Without Borders claims are “false and misleading.” The statement says only 53 were counted and that many had died from natural causes.Chase stands by his numbers. “I am an objective scientist, with no political agenda. I am sad that our government has responded in this way.” He says there’s a GPS location for each of the 87 carcasses and that there are multiple witnesses who saw each one. Every flight has four people, including one government employee, and voice recordings from the flights will bear out these findings, Chase says.Botswana is home to more than 130,000 elephants—about a third of Africa’s savanna elephants—and it appeared to have largely escaped the recent ivory poaching crisis. Continent-wide elephant numbers dropped by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census, an 18-country comprehensive aerial elephant count conducted by Elephants Without Borders that was completed in 2016. Elephants play a critical role in Botswana’s tourist economy, which drew nearly two million international visitors in 2017.The discovery of these carcasses, which Chase says are mainly of older males with big tusks, could indicate a growing infiltration of organized poaching teams into the country. It comes at a time when humans are increasingly in conflict with elephants—in part because of Botswana’s comparatively large elephant numbers. And it comes just as the government has decided to take weapons away from its rangers.For decades Botswana has taken an aggressive approach toward poachers. During the late 1980s, former president Ian Khama, then the commander of the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), deployed 800 soldiers to help combat poaching and to assist anti-poaching game rangers. In 2014 Botswana adopted a unwritten shoot-to-kill policy, of debatable legality.In May, Botswana’s new president Mokgweetsi Masisi decided to disarm the country’s anti-poaching unit. The month before when Masisi was sworn in, he discovered that there was never a legal framework for arming the anti-poaching unit. That’s why their weapons were taken away, says Dereck Joubert, a wildlife filmmaker and National Geographic explorer-in-residence based in Botswana. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks calls it a “corrective measure.”Disarming the anti-poaching unit has led some, including Chase, to conclude that the recent killings were at least partly linked to the decision. While shoot-to-kill has always been a controversial anti-poaching strategy, giving rangers weapons has not.“I find it very difficult that any government would send its citizens out to the front lines to fight highly organized criminal networks who are armed to the teeth without weapons,” Chase says. “This is the largest elephant range left on the planet. It is very remote and difficult to access, and expecting the BDF [to handle it on their own] is not fair.”Still, Joubert finds it hard to believe that the disarming of the unit was the cause of these recent elephant killings. “To say the poaching occurred because the weapons were taken [from the anti-poaching unit] away doesn’t make any sense. There are still 800 armed BDF out there,” he says.Elephants are highly social and form tight family groups. Here, a family enjoys time together at Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve.Goemeone Mogomotsi, a legal officer at the University of Botswana who has studied the country’s anti-poaching strategies, called the decision to disarm the anti-poaching unit “unfortunate and regressive.”In a 2017 paper by Mogomotsi and his colleague Patricia Kefilwe Madigele, the co-authors argue that Botswana has become a haven for elephants precisely because it armed its game rangers and deployed the military to conservation areas. (They also argue that Botswana’s shoot-to-kill policy helped as well, though this contention is strongly disputed by other scholars and is opposed by human rights advocates.)The cause of the poaching of these 87 elephants is likely more complex than just the rangers’ disarmament, says Vanda Felbab-Brown, a crime and security expert at the Brookings Institute.“The announcement [that rangers would be disarmed] probably significantly contributed to temptation by poachers to intensify hunting. But I think it’s simplistic to portray this as the sole cause,” she says.Poaching incidents have been increasing in Botswana during the past two years, she says, both at the community level and the professionalized level. She and Chase both make the point that as elephants have nearly been wiped out in neighboring countries, trafficking networks are likely moving into Botswana, where there are more animals to hunt.Felbab-Brown also posits that Botswana’s 2014 hunting ban may have led to more poaching. Communities that previously benefited from the trophy hunting industry and related tourism services lost employment opportunities and sources of income when the ban went into effect. Photographic tourism didn’t increase enough to make up the difference, according to recent research by Joseph Mbaiwa at the Okavango Research Institute, at University of Botswana.Communities also lost an important source of game meat, and the lack of hunting meant more more wildlife on village doorsteps. That has led to more encounters between people and elephants, thereby increasing the incentive to kill encroaching animals illegally. These factors combined to cause people living in rural areas to develop more negative attitudes toward wildlife, according to Mbaiwa, and that in turn may have spurred an increase in poaching.Joubert disagrees. He says that when hunting was allowed, concessions were only occupied five months out of the year, leaving those areas especially vulnerable to poachers during the other seven months. With photographic tourism, the concessions are occupied year-round.The government is now reviewing the hunting ban.The demand for elephant ivory comes mainly from Asia, where it’s seen as a status symbol by some. Ivory is carved into tusk-size sculptures, figurines, chopsticks, jewelry, and a myriad of other items. While the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, the domestic trade in China remained legal until the end of 2017.China’s landmark decision to close its ivory market was celebrated around the world. But, says Felbab-Brown, the fact that these 87 elephants were recently killed in a place like Botswana seems to indicate that the ban hasn’t had the immediate effect many expected. “The ban has been effect for nine months, and this is still happening. It means there is still a lot of flow somewhere,” she says. “The Chinese market has not dried up.”Hong Kong and Japan, both of which have legal domestic ivory markets, remain major destinations for illegal ivory, as does China and the United States.“It’s a bleak time in elephant conservation right now,” Chase says.Joubert cautions against implying that there’s a poaching free-for-all in Botswana right now. Still, he says, “Even if one elephant has been killed, it’s one elephant too many. We have to mobilize. We have to make sure it doesn’t escalate.”",
"A well-planned street grid and an elaborate drainage system hint that the occupants of the ancient Indus civilization city of Mohenjo Daro were skilled urban planners with a reverence for the control of water. But just who occupied the ancient city in modern-day Pakistan during the third millennium B.C. remains a puzzle."It's pretty faceless," says Indus expert Gregory Possehl of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.The city lacks ostentatious palaces, temples, or monuments. There's no obvious central seat of government or evidence of a king or queen. Modesty, order, and cleanliness were apparently preferred. Pottery and tools of copper and stone were standardized. Seals and weights suggest a system of tightly controlled trade. (These archaeological findings unlocked the stories of our ancestors.)The Indus Valley civilization was entirely unknown until 1921, when excavations in what would become Pakistan revealed the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro. This mysterious culture emerged nearly 4,500 years ago and thrived for a thousand years, profiting from the fertile lands of the Indus River floodplain and trade with nearby Mesopotamia.The city's wealth and stature is evident in artifacts such as ivory, lapis, carnelian, and gold beads, as well as the baked-brick city structures themselves.A watertight pool called the Great Bath, perched on top of a mound of dirt and held in place with walls of baked brick, is the closest structure Mohenjo Daro has to a temple. Possehl, a National Geographic Explorer, says it suggests an ideology based on cleanliness.Wells were found throughout the city, and nearly every house contained a bathing area and drainage system.Archaeologists first visited Mohenjo Daro in 1911. Several excavations occurred in the 1920s through 1931. Small probes took place in the 1930s, and subsequent digs occurred in 1950 and 1964.The ancient city sits on elevated ground in the modern-day Larkana district of Sindh province in Pakistan.During its heyday from about 2500 to 1900 B.C., the city was among the most important to the Indus civilization, Possehl says. It spread out over about 250 acres (100 hectares) on a series of mounds, and the Great Bath and an associated large building occupied the tallest mound.According to University of Wisconsin, Madison, archaeologist Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, also a National Geographic Explorer, the mounds grew organically over the centuries as people kept building platforms and walls for their houses. (Explore the palaces and tombs of these "lost cities" across the Americas.)"You have a high promontory on which people are living," he says.With no evidence of kings or queens, Mohenjo Daro was likely governed as a city-state, perhaps by elected officials or elites from each of the mounds.A miniature bronze statuette of a nude female, known as the dancing girl, was celebrated by archaeologists when it was discovered in 1926, Kenoyer notes.Of greater interest to him, though, are a few stone sculptures of seated male figures, such as the intricately carved and colored Priest King, so called even though there is no evidence he was a priest or king.The sculptures were all found broken, Kenoyer says. "Whoever came in at the very end of the Indus period clearly didn't like the people who were representing themselves or their elders," he says.Just what ended the Indus civilization—and Mohenjo Daro—is also a mystery.Kenoyer suggests that the Indus River changed course, which would have hampered the local agricultural economy and the city's importance as a center of trade. (These four lost cities were jewels of ancient Africa. What happened to them?)But no evidence exists that flooding destroyed the city, and the city wasn't totally abandoned, Kenoyer says. And, Possehl says, a changing river course doesn't explain the collapse of the entire Indus civilization. Throughout the valley, the culture changed, he says."It reaches some kind of obvious archaeological fruition about 1900 B.C.," he said. "What drives that, nobody knows."A person standing in the doorway of the Monastery at Petra, Jordan,  shows the enormity of the ancient building's entrance. Carved into the  sandstone hill by the Nabataeans in the second century A.D., this  towering structure, called El-Deir, may have been used as a church or  monastery by later societies, but likely began as a temple.",
"Digging for treasure is as old as the first plundered grave.The urge to uncover buried wealth has obsessed countless searchers, enriching a few and driving others to the brink of madness.“There are certain men who spend nearly all their lives in seeking for—kanûz—hidden treasures,” wrote the British traveler Mary Eliza Rogers after she visited Palestine in the middle of the 19th century. “Some of them become maniacs, desert their families, and though they are often so poor that they beg their way from door to door, and from village to village, they believe themselves to be rich.”Not all the fortune hunters whom Rogers came across were desperate vagabonds. She also encountered sahiri, roughly translated as necromancers, “who are believed to have the power of seeing objects concealed in the earth.” These esteemed clairvoyants, often women, entered a trance that Rogers said allowed them to describe in minute detail the hiding places of valuable goods.Archaeology transformed those “objects concealed in the earth” from simple treasures into powerful tools that allow us to glimpse the hidden past.At first, the fledgling science emerging in Rogers’s day differed little from old-fashioned plundering, as European colonialists competed to fill their display cabinets with ancient statues and jewelry from faraway lands. But the new discipline also ushered in an unprecedented era of discovery that revolutionized the understanding of our species’ rich diversity, as well as our common humanity.If this seems an exaggeration, imagine a world without archaeology. No luxurious Pompeii. No breathtaking Thracian gold. No Maya cities looming out of dense jungle. A Chinese emperor’s terra-cotta army would still be hidden beneath the dark soil of a farmer’s field.Without archaeology, we would know little about the world’s earliest civilizations. Lacking a Rosetta stone, we would still puzzle over the enigmatic symbols on the walls of Egyptian tombs and temples. The world’s first literate and urban society, which flourished in Mesopotamia, would be known only dimly through the Bible. And the largest and most populous of these early cultures, clustered around the Indus River on the Indian subcontinent, would never have been revealed at all.Without the systematic study of sites and artifacts, history would be held hostage by those few texts and monumental buildings that survived the vagaries of time. The immense Pacific of our past would be broken only by scattered atolls: a battered scroll here, a pyramid there.Two centuries of excavations on six continents have given voice to a past that previously lay mostly submerged. Through recovered sites and objects, our distant ancestors—many of whom we didn’t know existed—can tell their stories.At least as far back as the last king of Babylon, more than 2,500 years ago, rulers and the rich have collected antiquities to bask in the reflected beauty and glory of previous times. Roman emperors transported at least eight Egyptian obelisks across the Mediterranean to embellish their capital. During the Renaissance, one of these pagan monuments was raised in the heart of St. Peter’s Square.In 1710, a French aristocrat paid workers to tunnel through Herculaneum, a town near Pompeii that had lain largely undisturbed since the deadly explosion of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The unearthed marble statues sparked a craze that spread across Europe for digging up ancient sites. In the New World, Thomas Jefferson had trenches cut through a Native American burial mound not to find lucrative grave goods but to assess who built it and why.By Mary Eliza Rogers’s day, European excavators were fanning out across the globe. Few were dedicated scholars. More often than not, they were diplomats, military officers, spies, or wealthy businessmen (and they were, with very few exceptions, men) intimately tied to colonial expansion. They used their influence and power abroad to both study and steal, as they filled their notebooks and carted off Egyptian mummies, Assyrian statues, and Greek friezes for their national museums or private collections.Fast-forward to the Roaring Twenties. The spectacular bling found in the tomb of the Egyptian king Tut and the Royal Graves of Ur captured headlines and altered the course of art, architecture, and fashion. By then, however, educated professionals had begun to grasp that the most valuable material from trenches lay not in the gold retrieved but in the data locked within broken pottery and discarded bones.New methods of recording fine layers of soil provided novel ways to reconstruct day-to-day life. And starting in the 1950s, measuring the radioactive decay of organic matter gave researchers their first reliable clock to date artifacts.(Click here to explore 100 discoveries in this interactive graphic.)In our own century, archaeology increasingly is done less in the trench than in the lab. What once had little obvious worth—burnt seeds, human feces, the residue at the bottom of a pot—is the new treasure. Through careful analysis, these humble remains can reveal what people ate, with whom they traded, and even where they grew up.Advanced techniques are even capable of dating rock art, providing insight into cultures such as those of the early Aboriginal peoples of Australia, who left behind little durable evidence. And the sea is no longer the impenetrable barrier that it had been from time immemorial, as divers gain access to shipwrecks ranging from a Bronze Age merchant vessel to the most legendary of all ocean disasters, the Titanic.The single most revolutionary development of recent decades is our ability to extract genetic material from old bones. Ancient DNA has given us an intimate glimpse into how our ancestors interacted with Neanderthals. It has also led to the discovery of our long-lost cousins the Denisovans, as well as the extraordinarily small people of the Indonesian island of Flores.A host of new approaches, from satellite images to x-ray fluorescence, allow scientists to probe sites and artifacts without putting a spade into soil or cutting a sample from a valued museum object. This means that we are less likely to inadvertently wipe out data that we don’t recognize but that later generations might yet recover.Archaeology’s often unsavory past nevertheless continues to cast a long shadow. Not until the past decade has a movement to repatriate ill-gotten foreign artifacts, from the Elgin Marbles to the Benin Bronzes, gained political traction. For centuries, American and European reluctance to train or promote Indigenous archaeologists meant that when the colonial empires crumbled, there were few homegrown researchers with the experience to carry on the work. Those who struggle to do so often are hindered by war, a lack of resources, and development pressures. One of Central Asia’s great ancient Buddhist centers, Mes Aynak in Afghanistan, has been threatened by looters, rocket attacks, and a government plan to mine the site, which sits atop a vast reserve of copper. In August it fell under Taliban control.The past is a nonrenewable resource, and every ancient site bulldozed or ransacked is a global loss. It is common wisdom today that local communities are an essential part of maintaining the health and well-being of natural ecosystems such as parks and wildlife preserves. The same applies to what our ancestors left behind.The destruction that has afflicted sites across the Middle East and Central Asia is all the more terrible because impoverished villagers often have little stake in protecting them. Threats to this heritage include idol-smashing groups such as al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as the buyers and sellers of looted artifacts. Peace and prosperity also pose dangers, when new construction destroys ancient remains.Despite daunting setbacks, there is good reason to believe that a second golden age of archaeology—one largely shorn of its colonialist trappings and racist assumptions—has begun.An influx of women and Indigenous researchers is revitalizing the field, while archaeologists (often an insular bunch) are now working more closely with their colleagues in other disciplines. They are charting global change through the ages with the help of climatologists, collaborating with chemists to trace the ancient spread of drugs such as marijuana and opium, and investigating more precise dating methods with physicists.Recent finds, meanwhile, show the power of archaeology to radically reshape the way we relate to our past. Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, the world’s oldest known temple, dating back some 12,000 years, suggests that our urge to practice communal religious rites may have spurred us to settle down and plant crops, not the other way around. Egypt’s pyramid builders were not enslaved people but skilled workers who earned decent wages and drank good beer. And ancient DNA paints a jumbled and complicated tale of our ancestors’ journey across the planet that can’t be contained within race theories and national myths.But archaeology’s real power remains rooted in its capacity to transcend intellectual knowledge and the creeds of the moment. Uncovering what has long been hidden connects us viscerally to our vanished ancestors. In that moment when an excavator brushes away the dirt to reveal an ancient coin or gingerly removes caked soil from a votive statue’s delicately chiseled face, the immense distances of time, culture, language, and beliefs can fall away.Even if we are just gazing through the glass of a museum case or at the pages of a magazine, we can find ourselves closely linked to the person who shaped a pot, secured a dazzling brooch, or carried a finely wrought sword into battle. There is a haunting poignancy to those 3.7-million-year-old footprints left one rainy day on the Tanzanian savanna, as if we are present at the dawn of our own creation.The task of archaeologists is not to find buried treasure but to resurrect the long dead, turning them back into individuals who, like us, struggled and loved, created and destroyed, and who, in the end, left behind something of themselves.The selections that follow are drawn from the newly published National Geographic book Lost Cities, Ancient Tombs: 100 Discoveries That Changed the World.20,000 years ago, FranceThe lifelike cave paintings at Lascaux and Chauvet represent an explosion in human creativity thousands of years ago—and show artistry that was stunningly advanced.On a September afternoon in 1940, four teenage boys made their way through the woods on a hill overlooking Montignac in southwestern France. They had come to explore a dark, deep hole rumored to be an underground passage to the nearby manor of Lascaux. Squeezing through the entrance one by one, they soon saw wonderfully lifelike paintings of running horses, swimming deer, wounded bison, and other beings—works of art that may be up to 20,000 years old.The collection of paintings in Lascaux is among some 150 prehistoric sites dating from the Paleolithic period that have been documented in France’s Vézère Valley. This corner of southwestern Europe seems to have been a hot spot for figurative art. The biggest discovery since Lascaux occurred in December 1994, when three spelunkers laid eyes on artworks that had not been seen since a rockslide 22,000 years ago closed off a cavern in southern France. Here, by flickering firelight, prehistoric artists drew profiles of cave lions, herds of rhinos and mammoths, magnificent bison, horses, ibex, aurochs, cave bears. In all, the artists depicted 442 animals over perhaps thousands of years, using nearly 400,000 square feet of cave surface as their canvas. The site, now known as Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc Cave, is sometimes considered the Sistine Chapel of prehistory.For decades scholars had theorized that art had advanced in slow stages from primitive scratchings to lively, naturalistic renderings. Surely the subtle shading and elegant lines of Chauvet’s masterworks placed them at the pinnacle of that progression. Then carbon dates came in, and prehistorians reeled. At some 36,000 years old—nearly twice as old as those in Lascaux—Chauvet’s images represented not the culmination of prehistoric art but its earliest known beginnings.The search for the world’s oldest cave paintings continues. On the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, for example, scientists found a chamber of paintings of part-human, part-animal beings that are estimated to be 44,000 years old, older than any figurative art seen in Europe.Scholars don’t know if art was invented many times over or if it was a skill developed early in our evolution. What we do know is that artistic expression runs deep in our ancestry.Circa 3300 B.C., Ötztal Alps, ItalyFrozen in time under a glacier in the Alps, this Neolithic hunter felled by a foe’s arrow about 5,300 years ago is the oldest intact human ever discovered.In 1991, hikers high in the mountains on Italy’s border with Austria discovered a mummified body protruding from a glacier. Little did they suspect that this “iceman” was a time traveler from the Copper Age. Indeed, further investigation revealed that the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman—named for the Ötztal Valley near his death site—is the oldest intact human ever found. “Not since Howard Carter unlocked the tomb of King Tutankhamun in the early 1920s had an ancient human so seized the world’s imagination,” wrote mountaineer and author David Roberts.Over the ensuing three decades, scientists have used an array of high-tech tools, including 3D endoscopy and DNA analysis, to examine the iceman and refine his biography in exquisite detail. What at first appeared to be a tale of a solitary Neolithic hunter overtaken by the elements has morphed into a riveting murder mystery.He was in his mid-40s, a rather elderly man for his time. He suffered from worn joints, hardened arteries, gallstones, advanced gum disease, and tooth decay. While these health factors made his life uncomfortable, they did not kill him.In 2001, a radiologist x-rayed Ötzi’s chest and detected a stone arrowhead, smaller than a quarter, lodged beneath the left shoulder blade. The forensic evidence became even more intriguing in 2005, when new CT scan technology revealed that the arrowhead, probably flint, had made a half-inch gash in the iceman’s left subclavian artery. Such a serious wound would have been almost immediately fatal. The conclusion: An attacker, positioned behind and below his target, fired an arrow that struck Ötzi’s left shoulder. Within minutes, the victim collapsed, lost consciousness, and bled out.For all the answers that scientists have found about the iceman, many questions still remain. At the top of the list: Who killed this prehistoric hunter, and why?730-656 B.C., Sudan and EgyptIn a long-ignored chapter of history, kings from a land to the south conquered Egypt, then kept the country’s ancient burial traditions alive.In the year 730 B.C., a man named Piye decided the only way to save Egypt from itself was to invade it. The magnificent civilization that had built the Pyramids at Giza had lost its way, torn apart by petty warlords. For two decades Piye had ruled over his own kingdom in Nubia, a swath of Africa located mostly in present-day Sudan. But he considered himself the rightful heir to the traditions practiced by the great pharaohs.By the end of a yearlong campaign, every leader in Egypt had capitulated. In exchange for their lives, the vanquished urged Piye to worship at their temples, pocket their finest jewels, and claim their best horses. He obliged them and became the anointed Lord of Upper and Middle Egypt.When Piye died at the end of his decades-long reign, his subjects honored his wishes by burying him in an Egyptian-style pyramid at a site known today as El Kurru. No pharaoh had received such entombment in more than 500 years.Piye was the first of the so-called Black pharaohs, the Nubian rulers of Egypt’s 25th dynasty. Over the course of 75 years, those kings reunified a tattered Egypt and created an empire that stretched from the southern border at present-day Khartoum all the way north to the Mediterranean Sea.Until recently, theirs was a chapter of history that largely went untold. “The first time I came to Sudan, people said, You’re mad! There’s no history there! It’s all in Egypt!” says Swiss archaeologist Charles Bonnet. But he and other modern researchers are now revealing the rich history of a long-ignored culture. Archaeologists have recognized that the Black pharaohs didn’t appear out of nowhere. They sprang from a robust African civilization in a land the Egyptians called Kush that flourished on the southern banks of the Nile as far back as the first Egyptian dynasty, around 3000 B.C.The Egyptians didn’t like having such a powerful neighbor to the south, especially since they depended on Nubia’s gold mines to bankroll their dominance of western Asia. So the pharaohs of the 18th dynasty (1539-1292 B.C.) sent armies to conquer Nubia and built garrisons along the Nile. Subjugated, the elite Nubians began to embrace Egypt’s cultural and spiritual customs—venerating Egyptian gods, using the Egyptian language, and adopting Egyptian burial styles.The Nubians were arguably the first people to be struck by “Egyptomania.” Without setting foot inside Egypt, they preserved Egyptian traditions and revived the pyramid—a burial monument forsaken by the Egyptians centuries earlier—for their royal tombs. As archaeologist Timothy Kendall puts it, the Nubians “had become more Catholic than the pope.”In the seventh century B.C., Assyrians invaded Egypt from the north. The Nubians retreated permanently to their homeland, but they continued to mark their royal tombs with pyramids, dotting sites such as El Kurru, Nuri, and Meroë with the steep-sided profiles that characterize their interpretation of ancient Egyptian monuments. Like their mentors, Kushite kings filled their burial chambers with treasure and decorated them with images that would ensure a rich afterlife.Little was known of these kings until Harvard Egyptologist George Reisner arrived in Sudan in the early 20th century. Reisner located the tombs of five Nubian pharaohs of Egypt and many of their successors. These discoveries, and subsequent investigations, have resurrected from obscurity the first high civilization in sub-Saharan Africa.1000 B.C.–A.D. 900, HondurasExtraordinary finds at the site of the ancient city of Copán in recent decades have helped archaeologists take a giant step forward in learning about the Maya.In a tunnel 50 feet below the grassy plazas of Copán, an ancient Maya city in what is now Honduras, National Geographic staff archaeologist George Stuart peered through an opening in a wall of dirt and stone. There, in a hot, stuffy, earthquake-prone space, he saw a skeleton on a large stone slab. Stuart’s archaeological colleagues had discovered a royal burial—most likely that of K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’, or Sun-Eyed Green Quetzal Macaw. The revered god-king, whose name appears in many of the site’s hieroglyphic texts, was the founder of a dynasty that maintained the power of this Maya valley kingdom for some 400 years.That momentous discovery was made in 1989, but Maya scholars had long recognized the enormous significance of Copán. From more than a century of research, they knew that the ruined buildings beside the Copán River served as the political and religious capital of an important kingdom before its collapse more than a thousand years ago. Early on, investigators came to realize that the section now known as the Acropolis—a roughly rectangular area that rises high above the river—served not only as the locus of some of the city’s most spectacular architecture and sculpture but also as the seat of governing power during the height of the Maya Classic period, from about A.D. 400 to 850.The rulers of Copán claimed descent from the sun and ruled by that right. They presided over a kingdom of some 20,000 subjects, ranging from farmers who lived in pole-and-thatch houses to the elite who occupied palaces near the Acropolis. As the archaeologists tunneled into the Acropolis, they came upon the most elaborately constructed and furnished tomb yet uncovered at the site. The remains of a noble lady rested on a thick rectangle of stone. She was richly attired and wore one of the most extraordinary arrays of Maya jade ever found. She was probably the wife of the founder, archaeologists believe, the queen mother of the next 15 rulers of the Copán dynasty.With the discovery of the queen’s tomb, it soon became evident that this part of the Acropolis constituted a sort of axis mundi—in effect, a sacred stack of burials and buildings hallowed by the presence of one of almost unimaginable power in the eyes of the inhabitants of Copán. Given all the clues pointing to K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’, it seemed that his final resting place could not be far away. The eager archaeologists dug deeper into the complex.Finally, behind a facade of red sun-god masks on a platform, they discovered a skeleton they believe is that of the founder himself. The king was at least 50 years old, had jade inlays in two of his teeth, and passed into the afterlife with a broken lower right arm. There were signs of other wounds, perhaps suffered in battle or from the rigors of the Maya’s ritual ball game.Continuing investigations suggest that the power derived from the founder began to falter with the capture and sacrifice in 738 of Copán’s 13th ruler by the king of a rival city-state. By King Yax Pasah’s time, a quarter of a century later, the power of Copán’s rulership had failed to rebound. After the Maya abandoned this site to the forest and the river, probably by the year 900, its stone buildings gradually crumbled. And yet, even in ruin, the site’s remaining ornate buildings and sculptures make it one of the greatest treasuries of art and architecture in the Americas.A.D. 200-800, AfghanistanA spectacular Buddhist complex is threatened by a huge copper mine and the Taliban takeover.An hour’s drive along the Gardez highway south of Kabul, there is a sharp left turn onto an unpaved road. The path continues along a dry riverbed, past small villages, paramilitary roadblocks, and sentry towers. A little farther on, the view opens over a treeless valley creased with trenches and exposed ancient walls.In 2009, a team of Afghan and international archaeologists and local laborers began to uncover thousands of Buddhist statues, manuscripts, coins, and holy monuments at this epic site. Entire monasteries and fortifications have come to light, dating back as far as the third century A.D. The excavation was by far the most ambitious in Afghanistan’s history.A fluke of geology put these cultural treasures in jeopardy, though. Mes Aynak means “little copper well” in the local dialect, but there is nothing little about it. The lode of copper ore buried below the ruins is one of the world’s largest untapped deposits, an estimated 12.5 million tons. In 2007, a Chinese consortium won the rights to extract the ore on a 30-year lease. The company made a bid worth more than three billion dollars and promised to provide infrastructure for this isolated, underdeveloped district.Before the deal with Chinese interests became public, artifacts already were in danger of being plucked out piecemeal by looters and lost to science. Afghan cultural heritage advocates demanded that the treasures be excavated and recorded properly before open-pit mining began.Originally projected to begin in 2012, the mining project was stalled by contractual disputes, sagging copper prices, and Afghanistan’s conflict with the fundamentalist Taliban. Now that the militants control the country, the future of the site is even more uncertain.The past archaeologists have revealed presents a stark contrast to the violence and disorder of today. From the third to the eighth centuries A.D., Mes Aynak was a spiritual hub that flourished in relative peace. At least seven multistory Buddhist monastery complexes form an arc around the site, each protected by watchtowers and high walls. Copper made the Buddhist monks here wealthy, and colossal deposits of slag—the solidified residue from smelting—attest to production on a major scale.Much is known about ancient Buddhism’s links to trade and commerce, but little is known about its relationship to industrial production. This is where Mes Aynak could one day fill in important blanks, hinting at a more complex economic system than has been understood previously.Puzzling out the full meaning of Mes Aynak will require decades of research. Archaeologists can only hope that time is on their side—and that they get the chance to reveal more of this little-known chapter from Buddhism’s glory days in Afghanistan.800–1500, East AfricaSwahili city-states on the shores of the Indian Ocean enjoyed centuries of wealth, thanks to trade linking them to Arabia, India, and beyond.“The city of Kilwa is amongst the most beautiful of cities and elegantly built,” wrote Ibn Battuta, one of history’s great travelers. The city minted its own coins and had houses with indoor plumbing. Its residents wore clothing of imported silk. During its golden age, from the 12th to the 18th centuries, Kilwa was one of some three dozen prosperous ports that dotted what is known as the Swahili coast. Those ports, which stretched from present-day Somalia to Mozambique, had evolved into powerful city-states that grew rich from Indian Ocean trade. They flourished as ships from Arabia, India, and China called at their ports to carry away goods that made the Swahili wealthy.Arabian sailors arriving in Africa found good harbors, a sea full of fish, fertile land, and opportunities for trade. Many stayed to marry local women, bringing with them the Islamic faith. The interplay of African and Arabian languages and customs created an urban and mercantile culture that is unique to this coast.At its core, though, the culture was African—a fact that early archaeologists failed to recognize. Subsequent excavations at sites along the coast have shown how wrong they were. On Songo Mnara Island in Tanzania, for example, archaeologists uncovered a planned community that boasted a palace hung with tapestries, several dozen blocks of houses, six mosques, and four cemeteries, all inside a wall.The Swahili trade network fell apart as the Portuguese muscled in and redirected goods toward the Mediterranean and Europe. But even as the trade hubs became backwaters, the rich Swahili culture endured through centuries of colonial occupation. “Swahili history is about adaptation and incorporation,” explains Abdul Sheriff, a Tanzanian historian. “Swahili culture may not be quite the same tomorrow as today, but then nothing living is.”1400s, PeruA ghost town in the Andes became a treasured window into Inca history after explorer Hiram Bingham introduced it to the world.On hands and knees, three men crawled up a slick and steep mountain slope in Peru. It was the morning of July 24, 1911. Hiram Bingham III, a 35-year-old assistant professor of Latin American history at Yale University, had set out in a cold drizzle from his expedition camp on the Urubamba River with two Peruvian companions to investigate reported ruins on a towering ridge known as Machu Picchu (“old mountain” in Quechua, the Inca language). The explorers chopped their way through thick jungle, crawled across a “bridge” of slender logs bound together with vines, and crept through underbrush hiding venomous fer-de-lance snakes.Two hours into the hike, at nearly 2,000 feet above the valley floor, the climbers met two farmers who had moved up the mountain to avoid tax collectors. The men assured an increasingly skeptical Bingham that the rumored ruins lay close at hand and sent a young boy along to lead the way.When Bingham finally reached the site, he gaped in astonishment at the scene before him. Rising out of the tangle of undergrowth was a maze of terraces cut from escarpments and walls fashioned without mortar, their stones fitting so tightly together that not even a knife’s blade could fit between them. The site would prove to be one of the greatest archaeological treasures of the 20th century: an intact Inca ghost town hidden from the outside world for nearly 400 years. “It seemed like an unbelievable dream,” he wrote later.Bingham acknowledged that he was not the first to discover Machu Picchu. Local people knew about it, and a Peruvian tenant farmer, Agustín Lizárraga, had even inscribed his name on one of its walls nearly a decade earlier. But Bingham did bring the mountaintop citadel to the world’s attention as the account of his work there, and at other sites in the region, filled the April 1913 issue of National Geographic.Bingham was also the first to study Machu Picchu scientifically. With financial support from Yale and the National Geographic Society, he returned twice to the site. His crews cleared the vegetation that had reclaimed the peak, shipped thousands of artifacts to Yale’s Peabody Museum of Natural History—which were returned to Peru by 2012—and mapped and photographed the ruins. The thousands of photos that he shot would change archaeology forever, demonstrating the power of images to legitimize and popularize the science.1600s, Southwestern AlaskaCenturies-old artifacts of the Yupik people, preserved in permafrost, are emerging as temperatures rise. Now the rush is on to save these treasures.The archaeological site of Nunalleq on the southwest coast of Alaska preserves a fateful moment, frozen in time. The muddy square of earth is full of everyday things the Indigenous Yupik people used to survive and to celebrate life here, all left just as they lay when a deadly attack came almost four centuries ago.As is often the case in archaeology, a tragedy of times past is a boon to modern science. Archaeologists have recovered more than 100,000 intact artifacts at Nunalleq, from typical eating utensils to extraordinary things such as wooden ritual masks, ivory tattoo needles, pieces of finely calibrated sea kayaks, and a belt of caribou teeth. The objects are astonishingly well preserved, having been frozen in the ground since about 1660.Climate change is now hammering the Earth’s polar regions. The result is a disastrous loss of artifacts from little-known prehistoric cultures—like the one at Nunalleq—all along Alaska’s shores and beyond.A massive thaw is exposing traces of past peoples and civilizations across the northern regions of the globe—from Neolithic bows and arrows in Switzerland to hiking staffs from the Viking age in Norway and lavishly appointed tombs of Scythian nomads in Siberia.In coastal Alaska, archaeological sites are now threatened by a one-two punch of rising temperatures and rising seas. When archaeologists began digging at Nunalleq in 2009, they hit frozen soil about 18 inches below the surface of the tundra. Today the ground is thawed three feet down. That means masterfully carved artifacts of caribou antler, driftwood, bone, and walrus ivory are emerging from the deep freeze that has preserved them in perfect condition. If not rescued, they immediately begin to rot and crumble.The global level of oceans has risen eight to nine inches since 1900. That’s a direct threat to coastal sites such as Nunalleq, which is doubly vulnerable to wave damage now that the thawing permafrost is making the land sink. “One good winter storm and we could lose this whole site,” lead archaeologist Rick Knecht says.When wooden artifacts began washing up on the beach, community leader Warren Jones helped convince the village’s board of directors that excavating Nunalleq was a good idea. Those conversations grew into a unique collaboration in which the community and the archaeologists work as partners.Yupik from the wider area now drive ATVs to the site to learn more about their heritage and touch the artifacts. Workshops at a new culture and archaeology center celebrate Yupik culture then and now. Jones is proud of the partnership and looks forward to more discoveries at the site.“I want our kids who are in college now to run the culture center and be proud that it’s ours,” he says.1912, Atlantic OceanIn 1912 the largest, most luxurious cruise ship of its day sank. Its discovery after decades of searching revealed stunning details of the tragedy.At 2:20 a.m. on April 15, 1912, the “unsinkable” R.M.S. Titanic disappeared beneath the waves, taking with her some 1,500 souls. Why does this tragedy exert such a magnetic pull on our imagination more than a century later? The sheer extravagance of the Titanic’s demise lies at the heart of its attraction. This has always been a story of superlatives: A ship so strong and so grand, sinking in water so cold and so deep. The ship’s fate was sealed on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. At 11:40 p.m. it sideswiped an iceberg in the North Atlantic, buckling portions of the starboard hull along a 300-foot span and exposing the six forward compartments to the ocean’s waters. From this moment onward, sinking was a certainty.Over decades, several expeditions sought to find the Titanic without success—a problem compounded by the North Atlantic’s unpredictable weather, the enormous depth (12,500 feet) at which the sunken ship lies, and conflicting accounts of its final moments. At last, 73 years after it sank, the final resting place of the Titanic was located by National Geographic Explorer at Large Robert Ballard and French scientist Jean-Louis Michel on September 1, 1985. The Titanic lay roughly 380 miles southeast of Newfoundland in international waters.Recently declassified information has revealed that the discovery stemmed from a secret U.S. Navy investigation of two wrecked nuclear submarines, the U.S.S. Thresher and U.S.S. Scorpion. The military wanted to know the fate of the nuclear reactors that powered the ships, and to see if there was any evidence to support the theory that the Scorpion had been sunk by the Soviets. (There wasn’t.)Ballard had met with the Navy in 1982 to request funding to develop the robotic submersible technology he needed to find the Titanic. The military was interested, but for the purpose of gathering its own intel. Once Ballard had completed the submarine inspection, if there was time, he could do what he wanted. He was finally able to begin looking for the Titanic with less than two weeks to spare. And then, suddenly one night at 1:05 a.m., video cameras picked up one of the ship’s boilers. “I cannot believe my eyes,” he wrote about the moment of discovery.In the years since Ballard’s expedition, organic processes have been relentlessly breaking down the Titanic: Mollusks have gobbled up much of the ship’s wood, while microbes eat away at exposed metal, forming icicle-like “rusticles.” The hull has started to collapse, taking staterooms with it. “The most shocking area of deterioration was the starboard side of the officers’ quarters, where the captain’s quarters were,” said Titanic historian Parks Stephenson after a manned submersible dive in 2019. Using state-of-the-art equipment, the dive team captured images of the wreck that can be used to create 3D models, helping researchers further study the past and future of the ship.How long will the Titanic remain intact? “Everyone has their own opinion,” said Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution research specialist Bill Lange. “Some people think the bow will collapse in a year or two. But others say it’s going to be there for hundreds of years.”However long the wreck lasts, the story will surely live on—of a vessel with too much pride in her name, sprinting smartly toward a new world, only to be mortally nicked by something as old and slow as ice.The National Geographic Society is committed to illuminating and protecting the wonder of our world.

"Thirty years ago this month, Europe’s most famous mummy was discovered lying face-down in the ice, on the edge of a lake nearly two miles high in the Ötztal Alps bordering Austria and Italy.Naturally preserved by more than 5,000 years of sun, wind, and freezing temperatures, the leathery remains of Ötzi the Iceman quickly became a global sensation, the subject of countless books and documentaries and even a feature film reconstructing his life in Neolithic Europe and his violent death.Today, Ötzi is carefully tended to by researchers at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy, where his wizened body is kept in a custom cold chamber maintained at a constant temperature of –21.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Four or five times a year, his remains are sprayed with sterile water to create an icy, protective exoskeleton that ensures he stays a “wet mummy” (one naturally preserved in a wet rather than dry environment).Go behind the scenes of Ötzi’s 2010 autopsy.In an average year, about 300,000 visitors travel to Bolzano to marvel at the ancient Iceman through a thick glass window that affords a view into his frosty chamber. Ötzi is equally in demand by scientists, who jump at the rare opportunity to study the incredibly well-preserved remains of a man who lived long before the rise of Europe’s earliest cities, and even before Egypt’s first pyramid was built.“Ötzi is, in my eyes, the best investigated human body the whole world has ever seen,” says Oliver Peschel, the Munich-based forensic pathologist in charge of Ötzi’s conservation.Here’s what three decades of research have revealed about the life and death of the Iceman—and what the future study of his extraordinary remains may reveal.Ötzi was wiry, short (5’2”), and about 46 years old when he died. He was left-handed and wore a U.S. men’s size 8 shoe. His eyes—still preserved in their sockets—were long thought to be blue, but genomic analysis has revealed otherwise. “We could prove he had brown eyes and dark brown hair, and he had a typical Mediterranean skin tone,” says Albert Zink, head of the EURAC Institute of Mummy Studies in Bolzano, which has done much of the core research on Ötzi.Read how researchers reconstructed Ötzi’s frantic, final mountain climb.The Iceman had type O blood, was lactose intolerant, and had a rare genetic anomaly that prevented his 12th pair of ribs from forming. He suffered from cavities, intestinal parasites, Lyme disease, and sore knees, hips, shoulders, and back. His 61 tattoos map onto the places where his bones and joints show wear and tear (as well as onto modern acupuncture points). Ötzi had broken several ribs and his nose during his lifetime, and horizontal grooves on his fingernails indicate had repeated bouts of physical stress—likely stemming from malnutrition—in the few months before his death. He was genetically predisposed to arteriosclerosis, and a CT scan confirms that his is the oldest known case of heart disease in the world.Based on carbon dating, Ötzi lived roughly 5,200 years ago (3350–3110 B.C.)Based on his DNA signature, Ötzi was part of the migration of Neolithic farmers that came through Anatolia (modern Turkey) 8,000 to 6,000 years ago, replacing Europe’s Paleolithic hunters and gatherers. His maternal genetic heritage no longer exists in modern populations, but his paternal line lives on in groups found on Mediterranean islands, especially Sardinia.Ötzi was found wearing only a single shoe, but many of his belongings were subsequently recovered around the site where he was found. His leggings and coats—one lighter, one heavier—were pieced together from the hides of local sheep and goats. His shoes were stuffed with wild grass and laced with auroch leather. His fur hat was from a brown bear.Discover how DNA tells the story of what Ötzi wore.The Iceman trekked through the Ötztal Alps with a wood-frame backpack and a deerskin quiver with 20 arrow shafts, only two of which had arrowheads. His flint dagger was sharpened with a tool fashioned from lime tree wood and a fire-hardened antler tip. A birch bark container, similar to those still made in the region today, held smoldering charcoal wrapped in fresh maple leaves that would’ve allowed him to quickly make a fire.One of the most important objects is Ötzi’s sublime copper axe. Secured to a yew handle with cow leather and birch tar, the blade was cast from a mold and is 99.7 percent pure copper. It was an extraordinarily wealthy item for the time, and its discovery pushed back the beginning of the European Copper Age by a thousand years.In the hours before his death, Ötzi had a hearty meal of einkorn wheat, red deer, and ibex. It took researchers 18 years to identify his stomach—via a 2009 CT scan—because the organ had shifted under his ribs to where his lower lungs are located.Learn more about how researchers determined Ötzi’s last meal.A gash between the thumb and first finger of his right hand revealed that Ötzi had been stabbed a few days before he died. It was an active defensive wound, meaning he likely tried to grab the blade. That wound was still healing when he was attacked again with an arrow that hit an artery in his back left shoulder. He may have had time to sit down and perhaps try to pull the arrow out, but it’s unlikely he could have reached it before he bled to death within minutes.Read how X-ray scans reveal Ötzi’s cause of death.The Iceman also had substantial brain hemorrhaging, but experts disagree about its cause. Did someone finish him off with a blow to the head? Did he fall and hit his head on a rock? Peschel says he doesn’t see good evidence for either of these scenarios.Based on analysis of pollen and the maple leaves he carried, Ötzi died in early summer. One theory posits that warm summer winds dried him out. But Peschel says it had to have been the frigid temperatures of the high mountain pass that preserved the Iceman, because his brain, which would usually liquify along with other organs a few days after death, froze quickly, preserving it in desiccated form.While hundreds of studies have already been done on Ötzi, more are in the works. Now that the Institute for Mummy Studies has sequenced Ötzi’s genome, they’re genetically analyzing his gut microbiome. “We would like to understand the whole community of bacteria that lived inside his stomach and his intestines,” says Zink.Discover how the Ötzi’s gut holds clues to humans’ spread into Europe.The diversity of our gut flora appears linked to our health, so researchers are keen to see the makeup of Ötzi’s. One early find, part of an ongoing study by the University of Trento involving Ötzi and 6,500 modern people, reveals that the Iceman had three of the four strains of the bacterium Prevotella copri. Indigenous people around the world have a variety of strains of the bacterium in their gut, but the 30 percent of modern Westerners with P. copri have just one, which tends to take over, reducing diversity.Another discovery is that Ötzi’s gut contained Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium found today in half of the world’s population, with severe or deadly health consequences for about 10 percent of us. The dominant strain of H. pylori in Europe today is a hybrid of Asian and African strains. Ötzi’s strain is nearly purely Asian, which suggests the African strain arrived in Europe after his death. This has implications for the debate over whether H. pylori is a natural member of our gut flora or needs to be treated with an antibiotic as soon as it’s identified.Another microbiome study of his gut found the pathogenic ancestor strain of Clostridium perfringens, today a common cause of food poisoning.The city of Bolzano plans to build a new archaeology museum in the next few years to house both Ötzi and a richer collection of Tyrolean artifacts. They also hope to improve the energy efficiency of the 22-year-old cold chamber system that supports his remains. (A second backup chamber is also on standby in case the primary one fails.)To better understand the natural processes that have preserved Ötzi over five millennia—particularly exposure to the elements and the actions of microbes—researchers at the Institute of Mummy Studies are now analyzing the naturally preserved remains of a chamois, a kind of goat-antelope, discovered in summer 2020 in the same region as Ötzi. Though only a few hundred years old, its state of preservation is similar to the Iceman’s, and scientists are varying the humidity and temperature the animal’s remains are stored at to better understand how those factors impact preservation. They’re also studying its microbial community, both inside and out. “We know there are bacteria and fungi that can survive the cold temperatures, so maybe if you change something, they can start to grow again,” Zink says.Technological advances will be key to unlocking more of Ötzi’s secrets—and are likely. His 5,000-year-old genome was decoded in 2012, just as next-generation sequencing was becoming more common and affordable. But even then, Zink says he never would have expected that one day researchers could also reconstruct the Iceman’s microbiome. “These methods developed so quickly, and now we get so much more data,” he marvels.Future research could focus on the functionality of Özti’s body, including proteins, lipids, and enzymes found in his tissues that may reveal information about his immune system. For now, however, protein analysis of ancient samples remains a very complex process.In the meantime, Ötzi’s caretakers have to strike a careful balance between making the mummy available for research and ensuring that research isn’t too invasive or frequent. The museum receives about 10 to 15 requests to study Ötzi every year. A committee of experts from various universities and the museum evaluates each request. About once a year they take surface samples for microbiology investigations. They only rarely defrost him. The last time was in 2019.“We won't have any idea what scientific methods scientists in 2050 will have,” says Peschel. “It makes a lot of sense to keep Ötzi in the best condition to make research possible in 20, 30 years.”",
"Shortly after 6 p.m. on a drizzling, dreary November day in 2010, two men dressed in green surgical scrubs opened the door of the Iceman's chamber in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. They slid the frozen body onto a stainless steel gurney. One of the men was a young scientist named Marco Samadelli. Normally, it was his job to keep the famous Neolithic mummy frozen under the precise conditions that had preserved it for 5,300 years, following an attack that had left the Iceman dead, high on a nearby mountain. On this day, however, Samadelli had raised the temperature in the museum's tiny laboratory room to 18°C—64°F.With Samadelli was a local pathologist with a trim mustache named Eduard Egarter Vigl, known informally as the Iceman's "family doctor." While Egarter Vigl poked and prodded the body with knowing, sometimes brusque familiarity, a handful of other scientists and doctors gathered around in the cramped space, preparing to do the unthinkable: defrost the Iceman. The next day, in a burst of hurried surgical interventions as urgent as any operation on a living person, they would perform the first full-scale autopsy on the thawed body, hoping to shed new light on the mystery of who the Iceman really was and how he had died such a violent death.Egarter Vigl and Samadelli carefully transferred the body to a custom-made box lined with sterilized aluminum foil. In its frozen state, the Iceman's deep caramel skin had a dignified luster, reminiscent of a medieval figure painted in egg tempera. With the agonized reach of his rigid left arm and the crucifixate tilt of his crossed feet, the defrosting mummy struck a pose that wouldn't look out of place in a 14th-century altarpiece. Within moments, beads of water, like anxious sweat, began to form on his body. One droplet trickled down his chin with the slow inevitability of a tear.This was not the first time that the Iceman had been subject to intense scientific scrutiny. After Austrian authorities first recovered the mummy in 1991, scientists in Innsbruck cut a large gash across his lower torso as part of their initial investigation, along with other incisions in his back, at the top of the skull, and on his legs. It was later determined that the shallow conch of gray rock where he had been found was on the Italian side of the border with Austria, so the body and the artifacts surrounding it were relocated to Bolzano. Over the years, numerous less invasive explorations of the remains were conducted there, including x-ray and CT scan imaging studies and an analysis of the mummy's mitochondrial DNA. The most astonishing revelation came in 2001, when a local radiologist named Paul Gostner noticed a detail that had been overlooked in the images: an arrowhead buried in the Iceman's left shoulder, indicating that he had been shot from behind. Later work by Gostner and his colleagues with more powerful CT imaging devices revealed that the arrow had pierced a major artery in the thoracic cavity, causing a hemorrhage that would have been almost immediately fatal. The oldest accidentally preserved human ever found was the victim of a brutally efficient murder.Other scientists filled in biographical details. Analysis of chemical traces in his bones and teeth indicated that Ötzi, as he is also called, grew up northeast of Bolzano, possibly in the Isarco River Valley, and spent his adulthood in the Venosta Valley. Pollen found in his body placed his final hours in the springtime, and his last hike probably along a path up the Senales Valley toward an alpine pass just west of the Similaun Glacier. Close examination of his hand revealed a partially healed injury, suggestive of a defensive wound from an earlier fight. DNA analysis of food remnants found in his intestines—his stomach appeared to be empty—indicated that sometime before he met his demise, he had eaten red meat and some sort of wheat. Putting these facts together, scientists theorized that adversaries had an altercation with the Iceman in the valley south of the pass, chased him, and caught up with him on the mountain, where the body was discovered more than 5,000 years later.It was a good story that fit the evidence—until Gostner took a closer look at the Iceman's guts. Though he had retired, the radiologist kept studying the CT scans at home as a kind of hobby, and in 2009 he became convinced that scientists had mistaken the Iceman's empty colon for his stomach, which had been pushed up under his rib cage and appeared to Gostner to be full. If he was right, it meant the Iceman had eaten a large, and presumably leisurely, meal minutes before his death—not the sort of thing someone being chased by armed enemies would likely do."Gostner came over and told us he thought the stomach was full," said Albert Zink, director of the EURAC Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, who oversaw the autopsy last November. "And we thought, OK, then we have to go inside and sample the stomach." After further thought, Zink and his colleagues drew up a more ambitious plan: a head-to-toe investigation involving seven separate teams of surgeons, pathologists, microbiologists, and technicians. Perhaps most remarkable, this choreographed intervention would be accomplished without making any new incisions in the Iceman's body. Instead, the scientists would enter the body through the "Austrian windows"—their name for the overenthusiastic cuts made by the initial investigators."This will happen once," Zink said, "and then never again for many, many years.""This is the brain," announced neurosurgeon Andreas Schwarz, as he maneuvered a neurological endoscope into the top of the Iceman's head. Like the other scientists in the room, Schwarz was wearing 3-D glasses, and as he inched the instrument deeper inside the skull, a blurry 3-D image appeared on a computer monitor. It was a little after 1 p.m., and by that point the Iceman had already undergone six hours of poking, probing, gouging, and sample gathering. The surgical teams had taken snippets of muscle and lung. They had bored a hole in his pelvis to collect bone tissue for DNA analysis. They had rummaged around his thorax, trying to get close to the arrowhead and the tissue around it. They had even plucked some of his pubic hair. His skin had lost its luster and had a dull, leathery look, like a chicken wing left in the freezer too long.Now they were peeking inside his brain to see if a mysterious shadow on a previous CT image might be an internal clot, or hematoma, at the rear of the skull, indicating a blow to the head. But the operation was not going smoothly. Schwarz's endoscope kept bumping into ice crystals that blurred the camera lens. After an hour, the neurosurgery team finished up, not entirely sure whether they had obtained a viable sample.The initial attempts to explore the stomach were also frustrating. Peter Malfertheiner, of the Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, tried to insinuate an endoscope down the Iceman's throat into the stomach, but five millennia of atrophy and mummification blocked the way. Egarter Vigl stepped in with a less delicate approach. Using the large Austrian window at the lower end of the torso, he stuck a gloved hand into the Iceman's gut. He pulled out two large chunks of undigested food, then switched to a kitchen spoon and scooped several more ounces from the Iceman's very full stomach.By the end of the day, the laboratory freezer brimmed with 149 biological samples—"enough for about 50 papers," quipped one of the biologists. As soon as the autopsy concluded, Samadelli lowered the temperature in the laboratory below freezing. The next morning he and Egarter Vigl spruced up the body with a fine spray of sterilized water, which froze on contact. Then they slid the Iceman back into his high-tech igloo and closed the door.The autopsy had taken about nine hours; analysis of the material gleaned will take years. The first revelations were disclosed in June, when Zink and his colleagues presented some of their initial findings at a scientific meeting. Thanks to the DNA in a tiny speck of pelvic bone culled during the autopsy, the Iceman has joined the company of renowned biologists James D. Watson and J. Craig Venter as one of a handful of humans whose genomes have been sequenced in exquisite detail.The genetic results add both information and intrigue. From his genes, we now know that the Iceman had brown hair and brown eyes and that he was probably lactose intolerant and thus could not digest milk—somewhat ironic, given theories that he was a shepherd. Not surprisingly, he is more related to people living in southern Europe today than to those in North Africa or the Middle East, with close connections to geographically isolated modern populations in Sardinia, Sicily, and the Iberian Peninsula. The DNA analysis also revealed several genetic variants that placed the Iceman at high risk for hardening of the arteries. ("If he hadn't been shot," Zink remarked, "he probably would have died of a heart attack or stroke in ten years.") Perhaps most surprising, researchers found the genetic footprint of bacteria known as Borrelia burgdorferi in his DNA—making the Iceman the earliest known human infected by the bug that causes Lyme disease.The autopsy results have also rewritten the story of the Iceman's final moments. The neuroscientists determined that blood had indeed accumulated at the back of the Iceman's brain, suggesting some sort of trauma—either from falling on his face from the force of the arrow, Zink speculated, or perhaps from a coup de grâce administered by his assailant. DNA analysis of the final meal is ongoing, but one thing is already clear: It was greasy. Initial tests indicate the presence of fatty, baconlike meat of a kind of wild goat called an alpine ibex. "He really must have had a heavy meal at the end," Zink said—a fact that undermines the notion that he was fleeing in fear. Instead, it appears he was resting in a spot protected from the wind, tranquilly digesting his meal, unaware of the danger he was in.And of course, unaware of the intense attention awaiting him far in the future. The Iceman might be the most exposed and invaded person who ever walked the planet. "There were moments yesterday," Zink said in a soft, almost surprised voice, "when you felt sorry for him. He was so … explored. All his secrets—inside him, outside him, all around him—were open to exploration." He paused and added, "Only the arrowhead remains inside him, as if he's saying, This is my last secret."",
"Mountainer Reinhold Messner, right, and colleague inspect the mummified remains of Ötzi the Iceman following his discovery in 1991.A wounded—and possibly wanted—man, Ötzi the Iceman spent his final days on the move high up in the Alps until he was felled with an arrow to the back. About 5,300 years later, archaeologists are still unraveling the mystery of his death. Now, a new analysis of mossy plant remains from the Iceman’s murder site may reveal details of his frantic, final climb.Since 1991, when hikers in the Ötztal Alps discovered his frozen, naturally mummified body near the border between Italy and Austria, researchers have counted more than 60 tattoos on Ötzi's skin and shown that he was wearing a leather coat stitched together from the hides of several sheep and goats. They recently found his lost stomach, and from its contents, learned that Ötzi was murdered just an hour after eating a final meal of dried ibex and deer meat with einkorn wheat. They've shown that the 40-something man was likely suffering from stomach pains when he died, and was nursing a seriously injured right hand, cut nearly to the bone between his thumb and index finger.Read 5 surprising facts about Ötzi the Iceman.To date, scientists have also documented at least 75 types of bryophytes, a plant family that contains mosses and liverworts, in and around the mummified remains of Ötzi. Now, these humble plants are revealing the Iceman’s final moments in greater detail, while reaffirming the idea that his last days were hectic and violent.In a new analysis published today in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers show how about 70 percent of the bryophytes found at the high-altitude Iceman site were non-local, with many of them originating at lower altitudes south of the Ötzal Alps. By working out how those botanical remains came to be deposited around Ötzi’s murder scene at the Tisen Pass—at an altitude of 10,530 feet—researchers have partially reconstructed the story of his final journey: a chaotic back-and-forth climb covering thousands of feet in altitude in a span of two days.James Dickson, a retired professor of archaeobotany at University of Glasgow and the lead author of the new research, has been studying Ötzi since 1994 when he received samples of organic remains excavated from the site where the mummy was discovered. Dickson says he was immediately intrigued when he saw flat neckera (Neckera complanata), a moss species that historically has been used for caulking boats and log cabins.Flat neckera was found in relatively large quantities at the site, often stuck to Ötzi's clothing. The moss may have been part of Ötzi's toolkit, though its purpose is still unclear. Was it used for insulation? Or perhaps toilet paper? In any case, the species only grows at lower altitudes; its presence helped researchers start mapping Ötzi's final journey.Learn how Ötzi’s gut holds clues to the spread of people across Europe."It was quite an unusual situation to find this person murdered in the Alps, at quite a high altitude," says anthropologist Albert Zink, who leads research on Ötzi at the Institute for Mummy Studies at Eurac Research in Bolzano, Italy, but was not involved in the new study. "Nobody could really explain why he was up there."Ötzi's preserved digestive tract contained not just food but also traces of background pollen from the environment in which he ate his last meals, which provided a vague map for his final journey in previous research led by Klaus Oeggl, an archaeobotanist of Innsbruck University in Austria, who is also a co-author of the new study.Samples from Ötzi's rectum and the lower part of his colon, representing the oldest digested food in his system, had traces of pine and spruce pollen. This put Ötzi in a high-altitude forest, close to the top of the tree line around 8,200 feet, about 33 hours before his death. But the middle tract of the Iceman’s colon contained pollen from hop hornbeams and other trees that only grow in forests at lower altitudes, meaning Ötzi must have descended to 4,000 feet or lower—perhaps reaching the bottom of a valley—9 to 12 hours before his death. According to the pollen evidence, Ötzi then ascended again and ate his last meal in a subalpine coniferous forest before climbing even higher to Tisen Pass, where he was killed.Read more on how scientists are unraveling the mysteries of Ötzi's life and death.However, it was not totally clear if Ötzi made his final descent down slopes to the south, in what is today Italy, or the north, in what is today Austria. There are only a few possible paths to Ötzi's death site in the rugged landscape."We really didn't know quite precisely where he went," says Oeggl.In the new study, Dickson’s international team of scientists drew from his extensive botanical surveys of the region and mapped the distribution of all the species of mosses and liverworts that had been identified in Ötzi's digestive tract and in the sediment around the body. (The distribution of these plants in the Alps 5,000 years ago was quite similar to the distribution today.)Around 70 percent of the bryophyte species found in and around Ötzi's high-altitude remains do not grow in the nival zone, the highest region of alpine vegetation which starts around 9,850 feet in this part of the Alps. Some of the botanical interlopers may have been transported to Ötzi's death site by the wind or by animals such as sheep and birds. But researchers claim that there were several low altitude mosses—not just flat neckera— which could only have been brought to the site by the Iceman himself. "The distance is so far that there is no other explanation," Oeggl says.Some of the mosses found at Ötzi's death site—including flat neckera—thrive in the Schalstal, a gorge to the south in Italy, but not in any of the nearby valleys to the north. Dickson’s map therefore points to the idea that Ötzi, in his last journey, climbed down into the Schalstal before his final ascent. The Iceman may have brushed up against mosses in the gorge, stocked up on some for his supply kit, or used them to wrap his food or dress his wounds. During his descent, Ötzi might have made it as far down as the Vinschgau valley bottom, around 2,600 feet in altitude, where he may have collected a species of bogmoss, Sphagnum affine. Dickson speculates that Ötzi may have known about the bogmoss's antiseptic properties and used it to dress his deep hand wound.The findings fit with the general picture that most of Ötzi's connections were to the south. Isotopic evidence, for example, suggests Ötzi grew up in the southern part of the Alps and lived the last few months of his life in that area, Zink says.Similarly, Ursula Wierer, an archaeologist from the provincial department of archaeology in Florence, Italy, says that "there is lots of evidence that the Iceman lived on the southern side of the Alps and that he ascended from that side of the Alps, to the site where he died." Wierer's recent analysis of Ötzi's toolkit suggests he was caught off guard with weapons in need of repair. She says this new study, which she did not participate in, is further confirmation of the hectic nature of Ötzi's end and "shows once again the importance of the archaeobotanical studies for the reconstruction of the last days of the Iceman."Bryophytes such as mosses and liverworts can only be studied in exceptional scenarios of preservation, such as an anaerobic bog or, in Ötzi's case, a frozen mountain pass. As such, they're "really uncommon in archeobotany," says Logan Kistler, curator of archaeobotany and archaeogenomics at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. "They don't make seeds or pollen that tend to be preserved on archaeological sites. They're pretty ephemeral in the environment." The new study, Kistler adds, is "a good example of how remarkable the Ötzi site is.""It's one of these extraordinary cases that makes life in the past real."",
"A reconstuction of Ötzi the Iceman at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy.Since the discovery of Ötzi the Iceman in a European glacier in 1991, scientists have recovered a wealth of information from his 5,300-year-old mummified remains: The brown-eyed, gap-toothed, tattooed man most likely spent his 40-odd years farming and herding, and was probably suffering from a painful stomach ache at the time that he died a quick—albeit violent—death in the Öztal Alps.(Learn how the Iceman’s stomach bugs hold clues to the first European migrations.)After 25 years of extensive scientific research and media coverage, the Neolithic Iceman has certainly secured his place as "Europe's Oldest Celebrity." However, only now are we getting a detailed answer to the inevitable question posed to every celebrity these days:"Ötzi, who are you wearing?"The Iceman was recovered back in 1991 with a full assortment of clothing, including a hide coat, skin leggings, fur hat, and hay-stuffed shoes. Due to the decomposition of the leather and fur over thousands of years, however, researchers have been unable to conclusively pinpoint specific animal species for some of the components of Ötzi's wardrobe.(See why clothing recovered from a shipwreck shows how wealthy people lived in the 1600s.)Understanding the choice of animals used in ancient clothing production—domestic or wild, local or imported—provides unique insights into the human past: Was the clothing worn purely for utility, or did it reflect the social status of the wearer? Were animal skins selected solely due to their availability, or were certain types of leathers and furs prized for specific qualities?Researchers were able to capture ancient DNA markers in nine samples of leather and fur from different articles of the Iceman's clothing. According to their study published today in Scientific Reports, Ötzi's attire choices were selective and pragmatic.(Read about the scientific autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman.)They confirmed that Ötzi's leather loincloth and hide coat were "haphazardly" stitched from sheepskin, an identification already made in previous studies. However, the genetic analysis revealed that the sheep species sampled is closer to modern domestic European sheep than to their wild cousins, and that the articles were fashioned from the skins of at least four animals.The analysis showed that part of Ötzi's coat was also made from domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial haplogroup (a genetic population that shares a common female ancestor) that still roams the hills and valleys of central Europe today.Clothes worn by Otzi the Iceman 5,300 years ago include (clockwise from top left): hay-stuffed shoes, goat- and sheepskin coat, goatskin leggings, bear fur hat, grass matting and sheepskin loincloth.The fact that the coat was made from at least several animals belonging to at least two different species leads the researchers to conclude that the Iceman's coat was stitched together, and possibly repaired with, any hides that were handy at the time.On the other hand, Ötzi's leggings were also crafted from domesticated goat leather, and not a species of wolf, fox or dog as previously thought. The fact that a similar pair of 6,500-year-old leggings discovered in Switzerland were also fashioned from goat leather suggests that it may have been a material deliberately chosen for its specific qualities.Shoelaces fashioned from the predominant European genetic population of cattle round out the domesticated species identified in the tests on the clothing samples.While Ötzi likely lived a life of farming and herding, he may have also hunted and trapped wild animals in his alpine environment. Genetic analysis shows that his quiver was made from wild roe deer, while his fur hat was fashioned from a genetic lineage of brown bear still seen in the region today.Follow Kristin Romey on Twitter.",
"A life-size model of Ötzi the Iceman.A report that Ötzi the Iceman has 19 genetic relatives living in Austria is the latest in a string of surprising discoveries surrounding the famed ice mummy. Ötzi's 5,300-year-old corpse turned up on the mountain border between Austria and Italy in 1991. Here is a rundown of the latest on the world's oldest Alpine celebrity, and some of the other remarkable things we've learned about Ötzi.(Read "Unfrozen" from the November 2011 issue of National Geographic magazine.)1. The Iceman has living relatives.Living links to the Iceman have now been revealed by a new DNA study. Gene researchers looking at unusual markers on the Iceman's male sex chromosome report that they have uncovered at least 19 genetic relatives of Ötzi in Austria's Tyrol region.The match was made from samples of 3,700 anonymous blood donors in a study led by Walther Parson at Innsbruck Medical University. Sharing a rare mutation known as G-L91, "the Iceman and those 19 share a common ancestor, who may have lived 10,000 to 12,000 years ago," Parson said.The finding supports previous research suggesting that Ötzi and his ancestors were of farming stock. The study used Y-chromosome markers that are passed from father to son to trace the Neolithic migrations that brought farming to Europe via the Alps. Ötzi belonged to a Y-chromosome group called haplogroup G, which is rooted, like farming, in the Middle East.The study's overall results fit the idea that the changes of the Neolithic Revolution spurred people westward into the Tyrol region, Parson said.He is nevertheless wary of any suggestion that Ötzi's distant relatives might be a chip off the old block, either physically or in their liking for simple grain porridge.2. He had several health issues.Since Ötzi's discovery in an alpine glacier more than two decades ago, scientists have subjected his mummy to a full-body health check. The findings don't make pretty reading. The 40-something's list of complaints include worn joints, hardened arteries, gallstones, and a nasty growth on his little toe (perhaps caused by frostbite).Furthermore, the Iceman's gut contained the eggs of parasitic worms, he likely had Lyme disease, and he had alarming levels of arsenic in his system (probably due to working with metal ores and copper extraction). Ötzi was also in need of a dentist—an in-depth dental examination found evidence of advanced gum disease and tooth decay. (See video: "Iceman Autopsy.")Despite all this, and a fresh arrow wound to his shoulder, it was a sudden blow to the head that proved fatal to Ötzi.3. He also had anatomical abnormalities.Besides his physical ailments, the Iceman had several anatomical abnormalities. He lacked both wisdom teeth and a 12th pair of ribs. The mountain man also sported a caddish gap between his two front teeth, known as a diastema. Whether this impressed the ladies is a moot point—some researchers suspect Ötzi might have been infertile.4. The Iceman was inked.Ötzi's frozen mummy preserves a fine collection of Copper Age tattoos. Numbering over 50 in total, they cover him from head to foot. These weren't produced using a needle, but by making fine cuts in the skin and then rubbing in charcoal. The result was a series of lines and crosses mostly located on parts of the body that are prone to injury or pain, such as the joints and along the back. This has led some researchers to believe that the tattoos marked acupuncture points.If so, Ötzi must have needed a lot of treatment, which, given his age and ailments, isn't so surprising. The oldest evidence for acupuncture, Ötzi's tattoos suggest that the practice was around at least 2,000 years earlier than previously thought.5. He consumed pollen and goats.The Iceman's final meals have served up a feast of information to scholars. His stomach contained 30 different types of pollen. Analysis of that pollen shows that Ötzi died in spring or early summer, and it has even enabled researchers to trace his movements through different mountain elevations just before he died. His partially digested last meal suggests he ate two hours before his grisly end. It included grains and meat from an ibex, a species of nimble-footed wild goat.",
"A scientist gingerly holds up the hand of the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old frozen mummy, during a rare autopsy. CT scans show that the Iceman, a fit man in his 40s to 50s, was murdered by an arrow shot into his shoulder.A new DNA analysis of the stomach contents of Ötzi, the famous 5,300-year-old ice mummy known as the Iceman, has found that his gut contains a strain of infectious stomach bacteria not seen in modern humans.The near-ubiquitous gut bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes some forms of stomach ulcers and stomach cancer. As reported Thursday in the journal Science, the ancient strain found in the Iceman—the oldest ever sequenced—suggests that he lived before the waves of human migration that came to define the gut microbes of modern Europeans.The study adds to the incredible amount of information scientists have gleaned from the Iceman, one of science’s most carefully studied cadavers. Ever since hikers discovered the frozen remains near the Italian-Austrian border in 1991, researchers have pored over them, studying everything from the make of his clothing to the pollen grains embedded inside him. The Iceman’s body has revealed clues to how early Europeans looked, lived, and died.“He’s the best-known, best-analyzed patient ever,” said the study’s lead author, Frank Maixner of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy.The unprecedented analyses tell the story of a brown-eyed, lactose-intolerant man who lived in a farming community most closely related to modern Sardinians. Perhaps most infamously, studies in the 2000s confirmed that he had been murdered, killed by an arrow to the shoulder that lacerated a major artery.Researchers hungered to know the Iceman’s last meal, a trove of information about early European diet, but had been stymied for years by what appeared to be his empty stomach. It wasn’t until 2011 that researchers realized his previously identified stomach was, in fact, his colon—his actual stomach, which had been pushed unexpectedly far up into his ribcage during his time in the ice, was full.A researcher locks eyes with the Iceman during an autopsy at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. Scientists originally thought the Iceman’s eyes were blue, but genetic analyses showed they were, in fact, brown.The “earth-like” mash that researchers recovered from the stomach in a 2010 autopsy partially supported by National Geographic didn’t yield initial hints, though a more detailed chemical analysis is set to come out later this year. But those samples, in addition to previously collected extras, also gave researchers the chance to look for Helicobacter pylori.H. pylori, which infected about half of all humans until recent hygienic advances, is one of humankind’s most persistent companions. In fact, genetic family trees of H. pylori backtracked from modern strains suggest that it accompanied modern humans out of Africa more than 100,000 years ago, hitchhiking around the world from stomach to stomach.The bacterium also accrues mutations more quickly than human DNA, helping geneticists precisely track changes in how the bacterium—and the humans carrying it—diversified and moved across Earth over thousands of years.Modern H. pylori strains suggest at least six ancestral branches to the bacterium’s family tree, each growing to dominate a different region of the globe. But modern European stomachs carry a genetic hodgepodge, a strain of H. pylori seemingly formed from a blend of two ancestral strains dubbed AE1 and AE2. How and when the two ancestral strains mixed remained a mystery, but one fact was clear: Humans helped them along.“Since we are the only host of Helicobacter pylori, this mixing of two bacterial populations can only ever happen if humans actually come together,” said Yoshan Moodley of South Africa’s University of Venda, one of the study’s senior authors, in a Wednesday press conference. “And by ‘coming together,’ I mean, intimately. Children would have to play with each other.”Previous studies suggested that ancient Europeans’ stomachs once carried AE1, which evolved in central Asia and later gave rise to south Asia’s most common modern strain. Human migration from northeast Africa would have then introduced AE2 to Europe.Researchers had struggled, though, to determine precisely when the influx from northeast Africa took place—making the Iceman’s known time of death and intact stomach contents invaluable.Maixner and his colleagues carefully isolated DNA from a fingernail’s worth of the Iceman’s stomach contents, cross-referencing it with modern H. pylori strains. Once they verified the DNA’s ancient origin, they found that the Iceman’s H. pylori largely contained the Asian strain, with a small fraction of DNA cribbed from the African strain.This means the major influx of northeast Africans must have taken place after the Iceman died. But the bit of a mix shows that—consistent with other archaeological and genetic evidence—the Europe of 5,000 years ago was a bustling, complex hub of human movement.Instead of sticking an endoscope down the Iceman’s throat, researchers obtained samples of his stomach contents through “Austrian windows,” large incisions made by the Austrian team that initially examined him.“There were continuous waves of migration—and continuous mixture of the bacteria,” said Albert Zink, the leader of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman and one of the study’s senior authors. “It wasn’t just a single wave [of humans] or two.”Though Daniel Falush of Swansea University, who wasn’t involved with the research, cautions that H. pylori can’t track human movements perfectly, scientists are thrilled by what they can now learn about history through our guts’ DNA. “I’m personally delighted,” said Falush, who led some of the original work characterizing European H. pylori.In an intriguing turn, researchers also found that the Iceman, no stranger to suffering, may have had to grin and bear the H. pylori in his gut.A close look at the Iceman H. pylori genome reveals that his strain was particularly nasty, containing genes associated with inflammation in some modern H. pylori variants. What’s more, the team found traces of proteins produced in response to inflammation, suggesting that he may have died with a wicked stomach ache.Scientists examining the Iceman didn’t find his stomach, the large, gray blob in the upper left quadrant of this CT scan cross-section, until 2011.The researchers are hesitant, however, to claim the Iceman had gastritis or stomach ulcers, or was abnormally sickened by the infection. That diagnosis would require intact stomach lining—too much to hope for, it turns out, after the Iceman spent five millennia in a block of ice.“We knew that he had a very, let’s say, ‘rough’ lifestyle,” said Zink, but not one out of keeping with the times. “In the end, it was for sure a tough life in this time period, but with regard to this life circumstance, I think he was still in quite good shape.”The study sheds further light on the hardscrabble existence of early Europeans—and pegs the timing of a migration that left its mark on millions of present-day stomachs. Not bad for a patient who spends most of his time in a subzero freezer.“He can show us how [our ancestors] made our clothes, how they lived, what food they ate...and the kinds of diseases they had.” says Maixner. “It’s like a time machine.”Follow Michael Greshko on Twitter.",
"The prehistoric iceman known as Oetzi died from an arrow-inflicted lesion to an artery near his left shoulder, modern x-ray technology shows.The finding clarifies the mystery of how the 46-year-old man died some 5,300 years ago high up on a mountain glacier in northern Italy.Oetzi was discovered in 1991 in South Tyrol 10,500 feet (3,210 meters) above sea level. He is one of the world's oldest and best preserved mummies.Scientists have studied Oetzi for years to determine his life history, but the exact cause of death has been unclear. Did he die from the arrowhead, or from other complications of a battle just prior to his death?To clarify the issue, Frank Rühli of the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and colleagues from the General Hospital in Bolzano, Italy, used modern x-ray technology to examine Oetzi's internal anatomy."[The x-rays] show the arrow first penetrated the skin for sure and then through the shoulder blade and then basically ended up close to the lung but didn't penetrate the lung cavity," Rühli said. "It ended up just below ... the clavicle, which is the collar bone."There, the scans show a 0.5-inch-long (13-millimeter-long) rip to an artery. A large blood clot is visible in the surrounding tissue.A laceration to the artery would cause massive bleeding and cardiac arrest, according to the researchers. They believe the iceman died within minutes after the arrowhead struck."Basically it's radiological proof for the cause of death," Rühli said.At the time of his death, someone removed the arrow shaft from Oetzi. Blood within the area where the shaft rested suggests the shaft was removed while the man was still bleeding, Rühli noted. But the arrowhead itself remains in the iceman's back, 0.25 inch (6.5 millimeters) from the wound.The research is published online in the Journal of Archaeological Science and will be reported in the July issue of National Geographic magazine.(National Geographic News and National Geographic magazine are parts of the National Geographic Society.)Earlier research suggests Oetzi spent his entire life within a 37-mile (60-kilometer) radius of where he was found.The new findings help round out the story of what happened on his final day.He ate a meal of venison, scientists say. Then he either became embroiled in a battle or was killed as a part of a ritualistic human sacrifice.Rühli, a medical professional, said he lacks the archaeological expertise to interpret what really happened to Oetzi on that day.But given where the arrow rests, the projectile either came from battle or "friendly fire" while hunting, rather than a sacrifice, he believes.Also, since the artery laceration would have caused death quickly, Rühli speculates that Oetzi was shot on the glacier, not in the valley, and then escaped to the mountains to die."It's more likely he was probably hit close to where he was found."",
"What does it mean to say a city is “lost”? We know where to find the remains of most great ancient cities, and many places commonly considered to have been lost were not unknown to regional societies.What is lost typically is not the location of a city so much as its story, its life in the world. Ancient cities and towns held in their crowded streets entire cultures: rulers and workers, foods and fights, markets and temples, children and pets. When the cities faded, those human experiences faded, too.An archaeologist’s job is to reimagine those stories, brick by brick. Around the world, archaeologists are still uncovering major urban centers that testify to the sophistication of early cultures. New discoveries made with lidar, an aerial remote-sensing method, have revealed hundreds of Olmec and Aztec ceremonial centers across Mexico.But challenges to the preservation of these ancient cities remain. Mining and drilling for oil and gas threatens the delicate Ancient Puebloan sites in New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon, which led to President Joe Biden proposing a 20-year ban on drilling within 10 miles of the settlement of intricately constructed sandstone houses and rounded, rock-lined ceremonial pits.“Chaco Canyon is a sacred place that holds deep meaning for the Indigenous peoples whose ancestors lived, worked, and thrived in that high desert community,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement. “Now is the time to consider more enduring protections for the living landscape that is Chaco.”Exploring Chaco and other ancient settlements in the Americas gives travelers a lens on the past—and a glimpse of why conserving these places is important. Here are three once-teeming cities in North and Central America that passed into obscurity, but are now very much on the map for archaeologists, preservationists, and travelers.From the 800s into the 1200s A.D., Ancestral Puebloan people farmed, traded, and conducted religious ceremonies in the high desert around Chaco Canyon, in present day New Mexico. To water their crops of corn, squash, and beans, residents harnessed the intermittent flow of local streams through canals and ditches. Traders brought in exotic goods such as scarlet macaws and cocoa from Mesoamerican peoples to the south.Chacoan civilization began to dissolve around 1140, perhaps due to a series of severe droughts. By the end of the century, the area was completely abandoned. Although Native peoples, including the Ute and Shoshone, moved into the area in the following centuries, the first documented journey into Chaco Canyon was a 1823 expedition in which men under Mexican rule uncovered the ancient ruins.The community of Pueblo Bonito is the most famous of the Chacoan towns, and the top attraction at Chaco Culture National Historical Park. It’s known as a “great house,” but to modern eyes it resembles a D-shaped apartment complex. Masonry buildings up to four stories high may have held more than 600 rooms used for living quarters, storage, ceremonies, and burials. Walls were held together with adobe, plastered and white-washed on the insides, and sometimes adorned with painted designs.More than 30 kivas, circular underground chambers, hosted Ancestral Puebloan religious ceremonies. By the 13th century, for reasons yet unknown, the Chacoans began to leave their settlements for other parts of the Southwest.Chacoan people had no written language, so much of what scholars know about their society comes from burials. One burial room, for instance, held 13 presumably high-ranking bodies surrounded by thousands of turquoise beads, shells, bowls, and pitchers. DNA analysis showed that many of the individuals were related through their mothers or grandmothers, indicating Pueblo Bonito may have been ruled by a matrilineal dynasty.(Explore the gilded treasures of these little-known Ancient Egyptian tombs.)Travelers can explore the UNESCO World Heritage site via guided tours, ranger walks through Pueblo Bonito, hiking and biking trails, camping, and evening campfire talks. The nine-mile Canyon Loop Drive includes stops at multiple ruins, including Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl, the largest and most intricate villages. Four backcountry hiking trails lead visitors to remote Chacoan sites, passing ancient roads, petroglyphs, stairways, and spectacular overlooks of the valley.Chaco is also recognized as an International Dark Sky Park. More than 99 percent of the park has no permanent outdoor lighting, ensuring prime stargazing conditions. Periodic special events include astronomy programs and telescope viewing of the dazzling night sky.In 1937, a woodcutter encountered carved, standing stone monuments in the western forests of what was then British Honduras, now known as Belize. Archaeologists eventually uncovered more monuments, as well as tombs, terraces, and residences in the remote site. The woodcutter had rediscovered the city now known by the Spanish name of Caracol (meaning “snail” or “shell,” a reference to the winding road that led to the site).Further studies revealed the city to be one of the major metropolises of the great Maya Empire that stretched from Mexico south to Nicaragua. Today, Caracol is one of the most best-preserved Maya sites in Belize.A widespread urban center more than 12 miles across, Caracol at its high point (A.D. 250 to 950) held at least 100,000 inhabitants. Most Caracoleños lived in dispersed residential groups nestled among terraced agricultural fields. The Maya elite lived in the city’s center, which held a raised royal palace and formal plaza. Like many other Maya cities, Caracol features stone ball courts, where players vied to keep a solid rubber ball in the air.The main attraction is the “Caana” or “Sky Place,” a 140-foot-tall pyramid that rises from the jungle floor and holds four palaces and three temples. The palace rooms were originally coated with white stucco and decorated with red paint.(Who built the great city of Teotihuacan?)Among the most intriguing discoveries in Caracol are indications that women held high ranks in this hierarchical society. Though women are rarely pictured in the area’s monuments, they were honored with burials in elite tombs within the city. Some pictographs, showing individuals in androgynous skirted maize god costumes, have spurred debates on their gender.Between A.D. 880s and 1000, Caracol was abandoned. Unlike other ancient cities, it did not fall to drought. Indications are that late Caracoleño society became increasingly stratified, with the elite hoarding most of the goods. At the end of the ninth century, the palace burned. Social unrest, and possibly outside attackers, may have spelled the end of Caracol’s long run as a Maya power.Visitors reach Caracol via a long, challenging drive on unpaved roads south from San Ignacio, Santa Elena, or Georgeville, cities along the Western Highway. A project to pave the roads leading to Caracol began in 2020 and is underway.The reward of the journey is 25,000 acres of wonder, with three plazas surrounding a central acropolis, two ball courts, and a number of smaller structures. At the visitor’s center near the entrance, you can see artifacts found at the site on display, as well as diagrams and photographs from decades of excavations. Booking a tour of the grounds in advance at San Ignacio or San Elena is recommended.Just four miles from present day St. Louis, Missouri, the Cahokia settlement arose from the rich floodplains at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers. Village farmers lived in these fertile lands from as early as A.D. 600, cultivating squash, sunflowers, and then corn. In those years, Cahokia was the largest city north of Mexico, with a population between 10,000 and 20,000, rivaling that of European cities of the era.The Cahokian community began to decline during the 13th century A.D. and the site was completely abandoned by 1350. Several hundred years passed before French explorers documented the find in the 1600s.Today, visitors to Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site see vegetation-covered hillocks of earth, but the site once supported at least 100 raised structures. An immense central plaza spanned the equivalent of 45 football fields.(Why the Nasca lines are among Peru’s greatest mysteries.)The largest construction is a terraced 98-foot-tall structure known as Monks Mound, named for the Trappist monks who lived nearby in the 1800s. Its base, occupying 14 acres, is larger than the footprint of Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Khufu. More than 200 million cubic feet of earth, mined from still visible pits, went into its construction. This kind of organized effort typically requires a centralized, hierarchical society.Historians know little of the city’s rulers or history, but evidence at the site shows that it was a cosmopolitan center of trade, crafts, and agriculture. It was occupied by members of the Mississippian people, who exchanged goods with others as far north as modern-day Wisconsin, and possibly with Mesoamerican cultures to the south. Like the Mesoamericans, the Cahokians enjoyed games, including one known as “chunkey” where players threw spears at rolling stone disks.Similar to cultures to the south, including the Aztecs, Cahokian burials may have included human sacrifices. Mound 72 at the site holds dozens of bodies, male and female, some of them decapitated.Beginning around A.D. 1175, something or someone began to threaten the Cahokians, judging by the protective wooden palisades they set up around the city center. A cooling climate and stress on the local environment might also have made the city less livable. By 1350 or so, the population had dispersed. Grass grew over some of the mounds, farmers flattened others, and the U.S. government cut a highway through the middle of the city in the mid-1900s.Today the remains of Cahokia are a UNESCO World Heritage site and a preeminent example of Mississippian culture. Visitors can explore the park via a 10-mile hiking loop around the entire site or a quick climb up Monks Mound, the largest earthwork in North America (it’s 100 feet high and around 1,000 feet long). An interpretive center offers trail maps, audio tour devices, and a museum of Mississippian culture with a life-size model of a village.This article was adapted from National Geographic Lost Cities of the Ancient World, which takes readers on an epic journey through ancient civilizations and their archaeological wonders.",
"More than four times the size of nearby Arches National Park, with less than half the visitation, Canyonlands National Park abounds with backcountry opportunities: mountain biking, backpacking, canyoneering, four-wheeling, and boating. More than any other desert park, visitors come to Canyonlands for solitude and adventure.According to archaeologists, nomadic peoples traveled here as early as 9,000 years ago. The region was briefly farmed by ancestral Puebloans (formerly called Anasazi), whose rock art is still visible there today. Rugged and hard-to-access geography helped preserve the area until the 19th century, when an army of uranium prospectors built hundreds of miles of roads in search of valuable minerals. Although the miners eventually departed, their roads remain.The confluence of the Green River—running 700 miles from Wyoming’s Wind River Range—and the 1,450-mile Colorado River forms a northwest-tilting anchor that divides the park into its aptly named districts. To the north looms the Island in the Sky, a broad mesa with a bird’s-eye view of the river 2,000 feet below. To the south, the Needles district bristles with red and white-banded pinnacles, grabens, and arches. West of the confluence are the hinterlands of the Maze, a great place to lose oneself in the study of ancient rock art panels.In July 1869, after two months of rowing from the headwaters of the Green River, John Wesley Powell reached the confluence during his legendary first river descent. After climbing up the walls, he wrote about the view in his book The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons: “From the northwest comes the Green in a narrow winding gorge. From the northeast comes the Grand [Colorado], through a canyon that seems bottomless from where we stand. Away to the west are lines of cliffs and ledges of rock—not such ledges as the reader may have seen where the quarryman splits his blocks, but ledges from which the gods might quarry mountains.”In the 1922 agreement known as the Colorado River Compact, delegates from regions surrounding the Colorado River parceled out its water to seven states and Mexico. Unknowingly making their calculations during the wettest period in history, they estimated the river’s flow at 20.6 million acre-feet (maf)—more than six quadrillion gallons—a year. That’s enough water to support 35 million modern households, even though 80 percent of the river is used for agriculture.(On the Colorado River, a long-feared reckoning is at hand.)By 2018, following much drier years, the river’s volume had dropped to 12.5 maf—4 maf less than the delegates had split up and allocated to California, Nevada, and Arizona in the lower basin, and New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming in the upper basin, and Mexico.In August, for the first time since the dam was built in the 1930s, the federal government declared a water shortage at Lake Mead, one of the river’s main reservoirs. Amid climate change and population growth, the ongoing “megadrought” underscores what most experts believe may be an enduring crisis in the Southwest.Still, during early summer in the heart of Canyonlands National Park, where these two great rivers join and boaters test themselves on notoriously challenging rapids, it’s hard to see the shortage for now. One reason: The two major Colorado River dams are downstream.During the dawn of the modern environmental movement, Canyonlands National Park’s creation evoked the same preservation versus resource development storm that exists in Utah today. In 1961, Senator Frank Moss introduced the first park legislation, with support from Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. But state Governor George Clyde and Senator Wallace Bennett fought the proposal as one that would “lock up” Utah lands. Heated controversy ensued.It came down to reconciling the differences between what Udall called the “scenery purists” versus the “resource hogs.” By 1963, Senator Frank Moss and Udall had compromised and reduced the size of the proposed park, cutting out sections prized for hunting, grazing, or minerals. More debate and more compromise followed, along with a delay that allowed the Department of Defense to fire rockets over the proposed park.Conservationists suffered another blow in 1963, with the damming of the exquisite Glen Canyon on the Colorado River immediately downstream of the proposed national park. (This came after they had prevented a dam from being built upstream of the proposed national park, in Echo Park—now Dinosaur National Monument.)As water began to fill Glen Canyon and pool upstream toward Canyonlands, President Lyndon B. Johnson finally signed the new park into law on September 12, 1964 (nine days after he signed the Wilderness Act). Canyonlands would be the first national park created in seven years—since Virgin Islands National Park—and it stands as the finest moment in Udall’s environmental legacy. Moss deserved much of the credit for the creation of the park, one of the most satisfying moments in his career.Most park visitors frequent Island in the Sky, which is close to Moab, Utah. The Needles area, also accessible by road, draws a smaller percentage of park visitors, while the remote Maze and its pinnacled labyrinth of canyons called the Doll House remain one of the most isolated and seldom-traveled corners of the contiguous U.S.Horseshoe (formerly Barrier) Canyon, a detached section of park northwest of the main park, is known for artifacts dating back some 9,000 years. The rock art there, unlike most of the panels in the park, was created by archaic-period nomads, and could be up to 7,000 years old. Horseshoe, in particular, is famous for its Great Gallery, which shows more than 80 ocher-painted anthropomorphic figures that are up to eight feet tall.The ancestral Puebloans (formerly called Anasazi, which meant “ancient enemies” in Navajo) first migrated into the Needles district of the park around the year 1200. Believed to have left Mesa Verde a hundred miles to the southeast when it became overpopulated, the ancestral Puebloans built dwellings and granaries—used to store squash, maize, and beans—that are still scattered throughout the park.Tree rings show that these people lived briefly in Canyonlands, during a wetter time that supported farming. They wore fur or feather robes; plant-fiber sandals; and shell, bone, or stone jewelry. In addition to planting, they gathered piñon nuts, wild rice, and sunflower and mustard seeds to grind into flour. They kept dogs and turkeys.In the 12th century it stopped raining, and the warlike Utes arrived. According to some archaeologists, the combination of drought and newcomers forced the ancestral Puebloans to head farther south and abandon the Canyonlands region. Even today, potsherds (or pottery fragments) can be found poking out of the sand near their surviving granaries; visitors should be careful to leave these artifacts untouched.It’s not hard to picture the lives of the ancestral Puebloans amid the ruin sites, where drawings of bighorn sheep or hunters with spears along with crescent moons, lightning bolts, and snakes endure.(A decades-long fight to honor Pueblo Nations history is spurring an arts movement.)In addition to carefully pecked or painted anthropomorphs guarding the walls, the artists often left “negative” handprints throughout the park. By spitting out mixtures of gypsum, urine, and yarrow from their mouths against their hands held against the wall, the former inhabitants effectively left their signatures along with a hint of flesh and blood. Being careful not to touch or smudge their artwork, you can view Wingate walls and sense the same heat of sandstone felt by ancient artists. It’s almost as if they could’ve passed through just yesterday.A version of this article originally appeared in the National Geographic Atlas of the National Parks, which takes readers on an epic journey through the extraordinary and unique features that distinguish these wilderness areas.",
"Perched high above the Colorado River, Arches National Park is part of southern Utah's extended canyon country, carved and shaped by weathering and erosion. Courthouse Towers is close to the park's headquarters.Location: Utah Established: November 12, 1971 Size: 76,359 acresThis park contains more than 2,000 natural arches—the greatest concentration in the country. But numbers have no significance beside the grandeur of the landscape—the arches, the giant balanced rocks, spires, pinnacles, and slickrock domes against the enormous sky.Perched high above the Colorado River, the park is part of southern Utah's extended canyon country, carved and shaped by eons of weathering and erosion. Some 300 million years ago, inland seas covered the large basin that formed this region. The seas refilled and evaporated—29 times in all—leaving behind salt beds thousands of feet thick. Later, sand and boulders carried down by streams from the uplands eventually buried the salt beds beneath thick layers of stone. Because the salt layer is less dense than the overlying blanket of rock, it rises up through it, forming it into domes and ridges, with valleys in between.Most of the formations at Arches are made of soft red sandstone deposited 150 million years ago. Much later, groundwater began to dissolve the underlying salt deposits. The sandstone domes collapsed and weathered into a maze of vertical rock slabs called "fins." Sections of these slender walls eventually wore through, creating the spectacular rock sculptures that visitors to Arches see today.The land has a timeless, indestructible look that is misleading. More than 700,000 visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. One concern is a dark scale called biological soil crust composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in sandy areas in the park. Footprints tracked across this living community may remain visible for years. In fact, the aridity helps preserve traces of past activity for centuries. Visitors are asked to walk only on designated trails or stay on slickrock or wash bottoms.There are more than 2,000 arches in the park; to be classified as an arch, the opening must measure at least three feet across. The largest arch in the park, Landscape Arch, spans 306 feet (longer than a football field) base to base. New arches are constantly forming, while old ones occasionally collapse—most recently Wall Arch, which fell in 2008.Arches National Park contains ephemeral pools, from a few inches to several feet in depth, that are essentially mini-ecosystems, home to tadpoles, fairy shrimp, and insects. The pools form among the sandstone basins, within potholes that collect the rare rainwater and sediment.About 300 million years ago an inland sea covered what is now Arches National Park. The sea evaporated and re-formed more than 29 times, leaving behind salt beds thousands of feet thick.Another unique aspect of the park is its knobby black ground cover, which is actually alive. A biological soil crust, it is composed of algae, lichens, and cyanobacteria (one of Earth’s earliest life forms), and provides a secure foundation for the desert plants.Be sure to check for road closures throughout 2017 while major construction is happening throughout the park.",
"Shafer Trail Road winds along the cliffs of the White Rim in Canyonlands National Park.At Island in the Sky’s Grand View Point Overlook, sync your visit to an hour before sunset. As shadows play across a vast tectonic landscape of Jurassic period rock, you’ll feel the primeval pull of a land forgotten by time.Launch out on a multiday, 100-mile mountain bike trek along the White Rim Trail or raft down otherwise inaccessible Cataract Canyon, plunging through some of the gnarliest class V rapids in North America.If you’re up for a challenge, you can take a ranger-led hike into Horseshoe Canyon and stand face-to-face with shamanic life-size figures painted between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 500 by mysterious pre-ancient Puebloan nomads.Pace your day along the Needles’ 6.5-mile-long Scenic Drive, stopping for four self-guided hikes as time permits: Roadside Ruin to see an ancient Puebloan granary (20 minutes); Cave Spring Trail to view an old-style cowboy camp next to an alcove spring with ancient pictographs (45 minutes); Pothole Point Trail to inspect ephemeral ponds teeming with micro-life (45 minutes); and a 2.4-mile loop on the Slickrock Foot Trail, your best chance for spying bighorn sheep in the Needles. (Tip: Look for their white rumps.)In Island in the Sky, it’s a half-mile walk to the park’s greatest mystery, Upheaval Dome. Is the mile-wide crater the result of a collapsed salt dome or a meteor strike? (Among geologists, it’s a split verdict.) Explore Aztec Butte, a mile-long trail that begins with an easy saunter along a sandy wash then requires some steep friction walking on Navajo slickrock to reach the top. Look for several 800-year-old ancestral Puebloan granaries hiding beneath the rim.In the Needles district, the classic hike is a six-mile round-trip route from the Elephant Hill trailhead to Chesler Park, a vast sage-scented meadow edged by the park’s namesake sandstone spires. The 10-mile round-trip Confluence Overlook Trail demands a bit more sweat equity. There’s scant shade hereabouts as you hike across Big Spring and Elephant Canyons but the payoff is spectacular: a yawning 1,000-foot chasm where the mighty Colorado and Green Rivers merge.One of Utah’s few remaining native herds of desert bighorn sheep roams the park, never straying far from its water sources. Near rivers and streams, you’ll also find many of the park’s 273 bird species. Keep an ear out for the park’s songsters: canyon wrens in steep walled canyons, western meadowlarks in the grasslands, black-throated gray warblers in the piñon-juniper woodlands.Wildflowers peak in May—orange globemallow, claret cup cactus, Indian paintbrush—as yellowy stands of cliff rose release a potent fragrance. The sego lily, Utah’s state flower, is a rare find. (Look for it hiding among the sagebrush). A second wildflower bloom unfolds in early fall depending on the rain. Moonlit walks reveal night-blooming wildflowers: sand verbena, evening primrose, and sacred datura.Sunrise casts an orange glow on the underside of Mesa Arch, the park’s most sought after image. But you’ll have to arrive at least an hour before sunup to jockey for prime tripod space. The Needles’ most intriguing subject is imposing Druid Arch, an angular rock span evoking Stonehenge (hence its name). Given the 5.4-mile-long trail to get there, a dawn departure is required to arrive while optimum light still illuminates the arch.Don’t try to visit Needles and Island in the Sky the same day. You’ll waste two hours just driving from one district to the other. Instead, base out of Moab, an adventure-sports town that sits between the two areas. Visit I-Sky’s car-friendly overlooks on the first day for soul-stirring vistas of the Colorado Plateau. The following day, immerse yourself in the park by tackling the Needles’ network of rugged backcountry trails. Don’t even consider entering the backcountry-only Maze district unless you’ve got a respectable 4WD vehicle and plenty of backcountry cred.Dead Horse Point State Park, just outside the entrance to I-Sky, provides dizzying views 2,000 feet above a bowknot bend in the Colorado River. The John Wesley Powell River History Museum in Green River, 52 miles northwest of Moab, pays homage to Canyonlands’ most famous explorer.",

Want stories like this delivered to your inbox? Subscribe here.A disaster can be long expected and still come faster than expected.People have been forecasting a long-term drying of the West for well over a decade. By this spring, as Alejandra Borunda wrote for us at the time, it was pretty clear that the water level in Lake Mead, behind Hoover Dam, would drop below an elevation of 1075 feet this summer, obliging the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to declare a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time since the dam was built in the 1930s.And yet when officials did just that on Monday, a day when the news was consumed with the sudden collapse of Afghanistan, it still came as a bit of a shock.Arizona farmers will suffer first, as the state loses nearly a fifth of the water it gets from the Colorado. But Nevada will take a hit too. And if the drought wears on, and Lake Mead continues to drop, cuts are coming to the water supply of other states, including California.A long-feared reckoning is at hand. The “megadrought” is likely to wear on. "It’s really climate change that pushed this event to be one of the worst in 500 years,” Columbia University climate scientist Ben Cook told Borunda.People have been forecasting a long-term increase in wildfires in the West for a long time too.We’ve been watching it happen. Between 1983 and 2001, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center, an average of 3.24 million acres a year burned in the U.S. Between 2002 and 2020, that figure more than doubled, to 7.21 million acres a year.Drought promotes fire, climate change promotes both. This long hot summer has felt a bit like a doom cycle. Yet the path to limiting climate change is clear, and we’re starting to stumble down it. The path to healthier, less fire-prone forests is clear too: As scientists have been telling us for decades, we need to unlearn the lesson we absorbed from Smokey Bear, that all fire is bad, and allow controlled, prescribed burns back into the woods to clean out the excess fuel—like Native Americans used to do.At the same time, as Jennifer Oldham writes for Nat Geo, we need to pay more attention to Smokey Bear. The septuagenarian bear’s handlers are working hard to update his messaging for a younger and more diverse audience.What?Humans ignite more than 80 percent of all wildfires, Oldham explains, and 97 percent of all fires that threaten homes, in large part because of the American penchant for building homes in the woods. No spark, no wildfire—and with our burning of leaves on windy days, our undoused campfires, and our ill-placed fireworks, we provide most of the sparks.Sometimes we need to find room in our mind for truths that may sound contradictory. Our problems are massive, of the kind that only concerted action by governments can solve—Western forests need cleaning, Western water use needs reforming, the whole global energy system needs changing—and yet our actions as individuals still matter.And maybe, if we can manage not to lose heart, some of the good changes that need to happen will also come faster than we expect.What's being done to conserve water:— In June, Nevada announced a ban on “non-functionable grass” to conserve water. That term covers nearly a third of current grass in the Las Vegas area—and could reduce the state’s dependence on the Colorado River by 10 percent, EcoWatch reports.— During the last drought, California eventually required residents to cut water use by 25 percent. They got close, cutting use by 24.5 percent in all, largely by changing what they did outside their homes—including tearing out lawns, installing greywater systems, and putting in irrigation timers.— Conservation sticks. Before the 2015 California water restrictions, about half of all residential water use was outdoors. California’s residential water usage is still down 16 percent from pre-2012-15 levels, Borunda tells us.Robert Kunzig is Nat Geo's executive editor for environment.",
"Water levels usually peak in May at Folsom Lake in California, rising as Sierra Nevada snowpack melts away and courses down to the reservoir, near Sacramento.But this year, the drought that has gripped much of the U.S. West is already so strong that the lake is only half as full as normal. Instead of water, fields of purple lupines line vast swaths of dry lakebed.Folsom Lake’s situation is emblematic of the deepening drought across the western United States. As of May 6, 67 percent of the region was in a state of “severe” drought or worse; a stunning 21 percent is already in “exceptional” drought, the worst category in the U.S. Drought Monitor’s framework. At Lake Mead, one of the two major reservoirs of the Colorado River, which some 40 million Americans depend on, water levels are creeping toward a threshold that would trigger the first official shortage declaration for the basin.The situation is unlikely to improve in the near future, scientists say, as 2021 shapes up to extend the “megadrought” that researchers have found to be gripping the region mostly unabated since 2000.The region would have been in a state of drought regardless, “but it’s really climate change that pushed this event to be one of the worst in 500 years,” says Ben Cook, a climate scientist at Columbia’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.Drought can take many forms. There’s “meteorological drought,” which compares how much rain or snow has fallen compared to a long-term average. There’s “hydrological drought,” which considers how much water flows through streams and rivers and is stored in mountain snowpack and underground aquifers. There’s the drought the soil, plants, and animals feel, called agricultural or ecological drought.This year, by just about every measure, the West is extremely low on water. Most of California and the Four Corners states are somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of their long-term averages on most of the drought indicators. Snowpack in California on April 1, its usual peak time, hit only 59 percent of its long-term average and has already largely melted away, leaving it at a paltry 15 percent of its average at this date. Soils are parched. The Colorado and Rio Grande rivers are trickling compared to their long-term histories.The U.S. Drought Monitor ties all of these many pieces together into a weekly, U.S.-wide snapshot, binning the on-the-ground drought situation into six categories from “none” to “exceptional.” On April 22 they reported that 21 percent of the West was in “extreme” or “exceptional” drought, the two worst levels—nearly three times the area ever listed in that category this early in the year in the Monitor’s 20-year history.“It’s incredible, how much of the West is in extreme or exceptional drought right now,” says Sandra Postel, the director of the Global Water Policy Project, “including much of the Colorado and Rio Grande basins, the two lifelines of the Southwest.”The conditions are influenced by many factors, including a La Niña event that began last fall, which scientists know can contribute to dry conditions in the Southwest. In a La Niña event, ocean surface waters in the Eastern tropical Pacific are relatively cool (in an El Niño, this part of the ocean is usually extra warm). That cooling shifts the position of towering high-energy clouds, which tend to form over warm water, further to the west, which in turn affects the shape of planet-spanning weather systems. The effect “is like dropping a pebble into a pond,” says Samantha Stevenson, a climate scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara; where the pebble is dropped affects where the waves of weather move.The shape and pattern of the big weather ripples moving away from the Eastern Pacific toward the western U.S. make it more likely that precipitation-rich storm systems curve northward toward the Pacific Northwest and Canada rather than toward the Southwest.A healthy dose of random chance also feeds into the weather patterns that keep the West dry. But underneath the weather vagaries, human-driven climate change is making those conditions more likely.Dry conditions are nothing new in the U.S. West, which has cycled through water booms and busts for millennia.But the region has been in a state of drought nearly every year since 2000, when the Drought Monitor was established. That 20-year-long stretch rivals any drought in the last 1,200 years, a team of scientists reported last year.They knit together hundreds of tree-ring records from across northern Mexico and the U.S. West, creating a record that stretches back to about 800 AD. Trees record damp and dry years, growing more vigorously when their roots feel wetter soil and leaving behind slightly thicker rings. The team combined the tree rings with climate models to build a history of soil moisture, which indicates the intensity of drought.In that 1,200-year-long record, the region cycled through 35 major droughts, including four “megadroughts” of particularly notable strength and duration: one in the 800s; another in the 1100s; a third in the 1200s that has been linked to the collapse of Ancestral Pueblo culture in the Southwest; and one deep, intense stretch in the late 1500s that may have added insurmountable strain on Native communities in Mexico already stressed by colonization and disease.The previous megadroughts lasted decades—“20, 30, even 40 years, really eclipsing anything we’ve had to manage for in the last 100 years,” says Cook. In the past century, droughts like the 1920s Dust Bowl generally lasted only five to 10 years—devastating for those living through it, but significantly less disruptive than a multi-decade-long drought.This current dry stretch is already long and intense by comparison. It comes in second in their record only to the 1500s drought, which occurred in a world unchanged by human-forced climate change. That should give us pause, says Cook, because it shows the West can swing into such drastic drought states naturally, without the extra nudge of climate change. An extra push from humans could make the effects far worse.And, according to their analysis, that’s exactly what has occurred: This “megadrought” has been pushed into extreme territory by climate change. It would have been bad no matter what—their estimates suggest it would have been roughly the eleventh most intense in their record—but the added heat from climate change supercharged the drying, pushing it up to the second most intense drought in the last 1200 years.Human-caused climate change, in tandem with human reshaping of the natural hydrological systems—by damming rivers, growing vast fields of crops, and more—have shifted the baseline conditions so thoroughly that there is no way to return to what used to be considered normal. The physics are simply too different.Hotter air is thirstier than dry, capable of holding 7 percent more moisture for each degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer it gets. Climate change has bumped average air temperatures up 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the region since the early 1900s. The increase means the atmosphere more readily pulls water from streams and rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and plants and soils.The effects can feed back on themselves, exacerbating drought under some conditions. Evaporation takes a lot of energy, which is used to transform water from liquid to gas, using up energy that would otherwise be absorbed into soil as heat. As soils dry out, there’s less water to evaporate—so solar radiation just heats the ground further.“When we sweat, water evaporates from our skin, and that evaporation acts as a cooling mechanism for our body,” says Amir AghaKouchak, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine. “Earth’s surface works the same way.”Crucially, hotter air also means the precipitation that arrives is more likely to fall as rain than snow. Snow in the high mountains acts like a water tower, storing winter precipitation until it melts in spring and summer, smoothing the boom-bust seasonal precipitation cycle. With hotter air, whatever snow does fall often melts earlier in the year. Both contribute to a “snow drought” effect. Agha Kouchak and a colleague Laurie Huning recently found that in the western U.S., snow droughts lasted 28 percent longer after 2000, compared with the previous 20 years.And the effects cascade. Less snow can lead to drier soils, which can increase the chance of heat waves, which dry soils further.In the face of continued climate change, some scientists and others have suggested that using the word “drought” for what’s happening now might no longer be appropriate, because it implies that the water shortages may end. Instead, we might be seeing a fundamental, long-term shift in water availability all over the West.“Climate change is leading to a steady aridification of the western U.S.,” says Cook. “We’ve shifted the baseline drier and drier, making it easier for natural variability to send us into a drought and harder for natural variability to drag us out of an event.”The effects of the ongoing drought are already playing out across many western states.Along the California-Oregon border in the Klamath River basin, water reserves are so low that farmers in the region will receive only 8 percent of the water they usually get. The Yurok and Karuk tribes, which steward salmon and other fish populations along the river, are concerned that it won’t have enough water to keep the fish healthy.The Colorado River, the source of water for almost 40 million people, is struggling as well. Even hefty March snows that pushed the overall snowpack in the headwater region up to about 85 percent of its long-term average peak couldn’t make up for the water deficit that had built up, and the snow has disappeared much more quickly than normal, says Brad Udall, a climate scientist at Colorado State University.Lake Mead, the giant reservoir atop the Hoover Dam fed by the Colorado, is only 39 percent full, down over 130 feet since 2000. If the water level drops to below 1,075 feet (it was at 1079 at the end of April), a major water conservation plan will be triggered for the first time ever. The Bureau of Reclamation expects this to happen this June. If that threshold is passed, water allotments to the states that rely on the Colorado’s water will adjust in 2022; states on the lower reaches of the river, like Arizona and Nevada, will be hit with major cuts.Tribes in the river basin, who have long lacked consistent access to the clean and plentiful water to which they have legal rights, are also feeling the effects of the drought.“Navajo Nation has been the epicenter of drought for years,” says Bidtah Becker, a Navajo attorney and co-author of a new report outlining the water access challenges, highlighted by COVID-19, for tribes across the region. “This is a climate change matter, and it’s really important for the federal government to invest appropriately now so that we’re building water systems that are resilient for the future.”The fear of another year of intense wildfire is growing across the region, as well; recent years have seen some of the largest and most disruptive fire seasons in recorded history, driven in part by extremely dry conditions. In April in California, measurements of the “fuel moisture content” in chamise, a common and flammable shrub, were at dryness levels not usually seen before June.A good run of rain or late-season snow could offset some of the worst impacts, says Udall, but the likelihood of that showing up wanes as the season marches on. “We could maybe get lucky,” he says, but luck now would simply assuage the meteorological, short-term drought—not the bigger problem.“As warm and hot and record-setting as it has been the last few years,” he says, “what you need to keep in mind is, these are some of the coolest temperatures you’re going to experience in the next 100 years. Because it’s just going to get hotter. You ain’t seen nothing yet.”",
"Avoid larger crowds by exploring the Grand Canyon's North Rim, plus other iconic sites in the area.Visiting Grand Canyon National Park’s quieter North Rim offers several advantages. With only a fraction of the park’s 6 million annual visitors come thinner crowds, plus temperatures that average 10 degrees cooler due to the North Rim being 1,000-feet higher than the South Rim (because of snowpack, the North Rim is only open from May to October). The journey to the Grand Canyon’s secluded “other side” allows for an epic road trip that is just as rewarding as the destination. Starting 500 miles away in Albuquerque, New Mexico, here are eight stops in the Four Corners region that North Rim travelers shouldn’t miss.A visitor experiences sunrise on Bright Angel Point on the Grand Canyon’s North Rim.A destination in itself, New Mexico’s Chaco Culture National Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage property that protects the ruins of enormous “great houses” built around 1100 by the ancestors of today’s Southwest Pueblo tribes. The two-and-a-half-hour drive from Albuquerque to the remote park ends with 16 miles of dirt road driving, but the payoff is one of the darkest night skies in the United States and monumental archaeological sites still revered by Native Americans. Albuquerque’s new Hotel Chaco pays homage to Chaco Canyon and features Native American art throughout the property as well as day trips to the park. (See how Native Americans are recasting views of indigenous life.)Accessed from the intersection of US 64 and US 160 six miles north of Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, a circular plaque marks the only place in the United States where four states meet: New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. It’s a must-stop photo op operated by the Navajo Nation, and Native American vendors sell art and homemade food like fry bread.The iconic landscape of Monument Valley symbolizes the American West worldwide with its towering buttes and sweeping skies. Located on the Utah-Arizona border, a 17-mile loop drive takes visitors through the park, and guided tours are also available which allow access to more remote parts of the park. The 3.2-mile Wildcat Trail is open for unguided hiking. A $20 cash-only fee is charged to enter the park, and the on-site The View hotel has rooms living up to its name.Even if you’re not hungry for a Whopper, take a few minutes to stop at the Burger King in Kayenta, Arizona, to check out its impressive Navajo Code Talker exhibit. Code Talkers were Navajo who during World War II used their coded Diné Bizaad language to confound the Japanese. Classified until the Reagan Administration, the code was never broken and is credited with saving many allied lives. This Burger King serves as Kayenta’s de facto meeting place, and honors the Code Talkers with displays and artifacts brought back from the war by local residents that detail and honor their service.Navajo National Monument is often passed by on US 160, but it contains ancestral Puebloan ruins as impressive as anything seen at Mesa Verde National Park. Keet Seel and Betatakin are cliff dwellings that were constructed above the valley floor around 1300. Betatakin may be viewed from the paved, half-mile Sandal Trail that leads to an overlook. Bring binoculars and a telephoto lens. Free ranger-led tours of Betatakin leave from the Visitor Center mid-May through mid-September. Keet Seel may be visited with a free permit that’s granted to 20 people per day, on a first-come-first-served basis. The hike is 17 miles round-trip. The park is free to visit, with free seasonal tent and RV camping year-round. (See pictures of Route 50, the loneliest road in America.)Formed by eons of erosion, Lower Antelope canyon requires a Navajo guide to visit.Hike through this sinuous slot canyon just 7.6 miles from Page, Arizona. Formed by eons of erosion, Upper and Lower Antelope canyons require a Navajo guide to visit, which can be booked online. Visitors load up into trucks in Page for the 15-minute drive to the canyon’s entrance. Standard tours typically last an hour and cost less than $40 per person; more expensive photography tours allow more time. Taking a weekday tour may help thin out the crowds, and try to book for the afternoon when the sun is high and shines directly down into the canyon for vivid images.Free-to-visit Horseshoe Bend requires a 1.5-mile round-trip hike from the parking area just south of Page off of US 89. Here, the Colorado River makes a hairpin turn around a mesa in Marble Canyon (considered the beginning of the Grand Canyon) for a dramatic scene viewed from the opposite cliff ledge. Not for those with fear of heights: rafters can often be seen floating the Colorado River 1,000-feet below. Bring a wide-angle lens to capture the view.A stormy night creates a spectacular scene at Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado River.Navajo Bridge was the only vehicle structure spanning the Grand Canyon until it was replaced in 1995 by a new bridge immediately next to it. The old bridge was kept as a pedestrian bridge, and today visitors can walk across and take in the beginning of the Grand Canyon at Marble Canyon and the Colorado River 467 feet below. Often seen are Grand Canyon rafters who have started from Lee’s Ferry and endangered California condors with nine-foot-wide wing spans that call the area home. Park at the Navajo Bridge Interpretive Center on the west side of the bridge, open April through October. (Learn more activities to do in the Grand Canyon.)First built in 1928 and rebuilt after a fire in 1936, Grand Canyon Lodge offers basic amenities with priceless views. Grand Canyon Lodge was constructed in WPA-style with ponderosa pine logs and stone and situated right on the canyon’s edge at Bright Angel Point with open views. For campers and RVers, the National Park Service maintains a campground near the lodge with almost 90 tent, camper, group, and RV sites. The quiet North Rim has several scenic drives and hikes that accommodate a wide range of ages and abilities. Short hikes lead to big visual payoffs, such as the Bright Angel Point Trail that begins from the lodge and travels half a mile to a spectacular overlook. Along the way, keep an eye out for crinoid and other marine fossils.",
"Monument Valley, a Navajo Tribal park located along the Arizona/Utah border, is a truly iconic American scene. Decades of movie goers, if they close their eyes and think, “American West” will probably see the Mittens and Merrick buttes in their mind. This place has been memorialized in countless movies, photographs, and even video games. How could I hope to make a photograph here that does justice to the scene, but still make it my own? I had a plan to try and make that happen.Before arriving I had contracted with a Navajo guide and driver to take me out on two excursions, one at sunrise and one at sunset. The sunrise outing was mildly successful, but the sun never really came out. I wasn’t too disappointed, knowing I would have another chance at the end of the day. By lunchtime it started to rain and I was getting nervous. My guide called and told me the road into the monument was too muddy and he wouldn’t be picking me up for our arranged sunset shoot.By 4:30p.m. I was sitting in a rental car in the parking lot cursing my luck, watching raindrops roll down the windows. Every 15 minutes I would venture out into the rain compulsively taking pictures of the murky scene, knowing that it was all a waste of time.But then at 5:30p.m. the sky started to get perceptibly brighter. Within 15 minutes the sun came roaring under the clouds and painted the scene with a double rainbow. There wasn’t time to find a unique vantage point, but like many national parks, the best view of Monument Valley is actually from the parking lot.While paying attention to the rainbow, I noticed that the clouds were being whipped around by a high wind. I love shooting time-lapse photos and realized that if I didn’t mind setting my camera on a tripod out in the rain, I might capture an amazing show of dancing clouds. For a successful time-lapse I like to have at least 250 to 300 photos of the scene. It was just 15 minutes before sunset so I did a quick calculation, determining that by using a three second interval between pictures, I would have 300 photos before the scene got too dark.However, there was an added difficulty to this particular scene. In normal daylight you need to set your camera on manual exposure to make sure the frames blend together smoothly. At sunset there is a pretty good chance that the exposure at the end would be radically different than the beginning. Time-lapse experts refer to this type of shot as “the Holy Grail” because it’s so difficult to achieve. It would seem that by simply setting the camera to an automatic mode, the problem would take care of itself. But that never works, the exposure won’t ramp smoothly from one frame to the next, producing a final result that has an annoying flicker.In this case, I put my camera on a tripod, set the proper exposure for the start, letting the built-in intervalometer of my camera take a picture every three seconds, and walked away to shoot more traditional pictures of the scene.Despite my planning, what really happened in the end was that I got lucky. I wouldn’t have been satisfied with this view as a still photo because it was taken from the most typical viewpoint. But by staying out in the rain, and recognizing the gift I had been given by the clearing storm, the result was better than I could have imagined.The journeys of photographer and former Traveler director of photography Daniel R. Westergren have spanned the globe.",
"Where the state of Nevada folds in half—from the elbow on its western arm at Lake Tahoe across to its Utah border—you’ll find the most direct route across the state. It crosses several communities, a handful of mountain ranges, a national park, and one reservoir, where bobcats, foxes, and wild horses roam free. There’s life, yes, but not a familiar way of life for many. It’s a place where the lines between John Wayne Westerns and everyday life blur, where ghost towns bleed into living ones. This is Route 50, the Loneliest Road in America.John lives in his car topped with a sign that reads, "Pray for me please." He stayed on Route 50 for three weeks, and says the sign is a way to start conversations with people who pass by.Or so says Life magazine. In July 1986, the publication honored the Statue of Liberty’s 100th birthday and highlighted American superlatives: On one page, the “Cutest” (a toddler actor) appears alongside the “Loneliest Road” below a photo of a seemingly endless highway that reaches across the desert toward the mountains, a lone cowboy on horseback crossing from one side of nothingness to the other. An anonymous AAA counselor is quoted in the article: “We warn all motorists not to drive there, unless they're confident of their survival skills.”Rather than keep motorists away, however, the moniker piqued curiosity—thanks in part to the Nevada Commission on Tourism. The public relations director at the time saw an opportunity in the article and released a Highway 50 survival guide the same month the Life article came out, rewarding visitors to the area with a certificate of survival signed by the governor. Highway signs touting the qualifier went up along the route at the same time, and it graduated from opinion to slogan.Flourescent lights illuminate a gas station in Silver Springs, Nevada.Dark clouds roll over a church in Baker, Nevada, near the Utah border.Before it was known as the Loneliest Road in America, Route 50 was anything but. In the 1850s, the Gold Rush sparked a caravan of wagons to head West along the thruway. According to the Highway 50 Association, the Roaring Road (as it was called) became so congested at times that hopeful miners and their families would have to wait days before they could access it—a Panama Canal of sorts, standing between the new frontier and the old.By the turn of the century, the road became California’s first State Highway and eventually connected the nation’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts. To this day, the California Department of Transportation calls Route 50 the “backbone of America.”And yet, as photographer Mathias Svold sat in his car along a network of dirt roads surrounded by miles and miles of yellow-and-red desert grass and the rattlesnake he had just narrowly avoided stepping on, it didn’t feel like that. “I was overwhelmed,” the Copenhagen-based photographer recalls. “On one side, with the beautiful nature, but also the snake reminded me that this is a dangerous environment. It was just me alone in the desert—with a snake.”That sort of isolation follows Route 50 for almost the entirety of its 400 miles across Nevada, but it’s particularly pronounced along this stretch, the 287 miles between Ely and Fernley designated by Life as the Loneliest Road. Here, you can’t count on cell service or gas stations, on places to eat or even people to wave at as you pass—anything to replace the eeriness of the hungry red desert around you. Even its small towns seemingly materialize and then fade into the distance like a mirage.(Meet the man who has lived alone on an island for 28 years.)Mimi has been working at Big Four Ranch in Ely for the past five years, the only state in the U.S. where brothels are legal. Big Four was built in the 1880s—the oldest brothel in Nevada that is still operating.Alien-themed decor blankets a room at the Stardust Ranch, a brothel in Ely.A street lamp casts Big Four Ranch in golden light. It is one of 21 legal brothels in Nevada.“From an economic development standpoint, we’re not considered rural,” says Dee Helming, chairwoman of the Pony Express Territory, which works with the state tourism authority to promote the towns along Route 50. “We’re considered frontier.”That’s precisely the draw for some of its residents. “There's just a mystique about Nevada,” says Helming. She moved to Austin, one of the few towns along the highway, in 1981 and today owns a laundromat, a bed and breakfast, and a cafe with her husband, Kip.“For us, it’s that freedom of living old school, I guess. It’s a whole different way of life. Your community is more dependent on each other. You have to understand, you’re 112 miles from the nearest Walmart; you're 110 miles from the nearest stoplight. You learn a lot of independence.”Bobby McShane has worked at Big Four Ranch for 15 years as head of maintenance. “I love this place, it has so much history and I know every corner of the building,” McShane says. “It is true that Route 50 is dead and isolated. But it is not lonely.”Marissa Wambeke has a drink at Owl Club Bar & Steakhouse in Eureka, Nevada. “I like the isolation here, but it is not lonely because we are a small community," she says.She encourages her B&B guests to discover the outdoors, get intimate with the history, and wander the ghost towns—to experience the very life that she and others along the highway live every day. “They either love it or they're so intimidated that they'll never come back.”(She arrived a tourist. The island inspired her to become its sole nun.)But Svold discovered that isolation wasn’t the only challenge to overcome. Nevada is the only state in the U.S. where prostitution is legalized, and in Ely, he came across Big Four Ranch, a historic brothel that dates back to the 1880s. Even knocking on the door took courage—he feared the unfamiliar. “Then I met Bobby,” says Svold, “and he is like a teddy bear.”A lone, white cross marks the roadside between Fallon and Silver Springs, Nevada.Bobby McShane, head of maintenance, has worked at Big Four for the better part of two decades. After welcoming Svold inside and grabbing a beer, he pointed out paintings of a woman that hung all around the barroom. According to McShane, a customer fell in love with one of the women working at the brothel—the same woman who looked down at them from her many frames. He spent all his money on her. “He painted these really beautiful paintings of her to pay the debt,” Svold says. “In Denmark brothels are not illegal, but they are taboo. But Bobby was romanticizing the stories from there, telling them like love stories.”Perhaps, thought Svold, the Loneliest Road in America isn’t so lonely after all. It’s big and vast and seemingly endless, and in that there’s solitude, yes, but not sadness.“Anybody can go there and look around and say, ‘Wow, this is lonely,’ and then leave and go back to where they came from,” says Svold. “But people who live there, it’s a permanent mindset. The difference is in having the solitude inside you, instead of it being a temporary feeling.”",
"Mauro Morandi has lived alone on Italy’s Budelli Island for 31 years. “What I love the most is the silence,” he says. “The silence in winter when there isn’t a storm and no one is around, but also the summer silence of sunset.”More than a year ago, when the world responded to isolation orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Mauro Morandi stayed put. He had no reason to move because he has spent the past three decades in isolation by choice.In 1989, Morandi’s catamaran—engine crippled and anchor adrift—washed up on the coast of Budelli Island, located on a stretch of water between Sardinia and Corsica. As luck would have it, Morandi learned that the island’s caretaker was retiring from his post, so he sold his boat and assumed a new role.Thirty-two years later, Morandi, known as Italy’s Robinson Crusoe, was the sole resident and guardian of the island. Now, after decades of protecting one of Italy’s most beautiful islands, Mauro Morandi has surrendered his post, responding to years of pressure from authorities who have asked him to leave.Sunlight drenches Morandi’s porch, where he likes to dine and read during the summer.Maddalena Archipelago National Park is comprised of seven islands. Budelli is considered the most beautiful among them for its Spiaggia Rosa, or Pink Beach. The rose-colored sand derives its unusual hue from microscopic fragments of corals and shells, which have been slowly reduced to powder by the shifting tides.In the early 1990s, Spiaggia Rosa was dubbed a place of “high natural value” by the Italian government. The beach was closed off to protect its fragile ecosystem—only some areas remain accessible to visitors—and the island rapidly went from hosting thousands of people a day to a hosting just one.In 2016, after a three-year legal battle between a New Zealand businessman and the Italian government for ownership of the land, a court ruled that Budelli belonged to Maddalena National Park. The same year, the park challenged Morandi’s right to live on the island—and the public responded. A petition protesting his eviction garnered more than 18,000 signatures, effectively pressuring local politicians to delay his expulsion indefinitely.But on April 25, 2021, Morandi told his Facebook followers that he had decided to leave at the end of the month after several threats of eviction from park authorities.The Spiaggia Rosa, or Pink Beach, derives its rosy color from microscopic fragments of corals and shells including Miriapora truncata and Miniacina miniace.“I hope[d] to die here and be cremated and have my ashes scattered in the wind,” says Morandi, who is now 81. He believes all life is eventually reunited with the Earth—that we are all part of the same energy, which propels Morandi to remain on the island without compensation. The Stoics of ancient Greece called this sympatheia, the feeling that the universe is an indivisible, unified living organism endlessly in flux.Despite his aversion to people, Morandi guarded Budelli’s environment with fervor and educated summertime visitors about the ecosystem and how to protect it.“I’m not a botanist or a biologist,” Morandi says. “Yes, I know names of plants and animals, but my work is much different than this. To be able to care for a plant is a technical task—I try to make people understand [why] the plant needs to live.”Morandi said that teaching people how to see beauty will save the world from exploitation. “I would like people to understand that we must try not to look at beauty, but feel beauty with our eyes closed,” he says.Winters on Budelli are both beautiful and lonely. Morandi endured long stretches of time—upwards of 20 days—without any human contact. He found solace in the introspection it affords him, and often sits on the beach with nothing but the sounds of the wind and waves to punctuate the silence.“I’m sort of in prison here,” he says. “But it’s a prison that I chose for myself.”Morandi passed the time with creative pursuits. He fashioned juniper wood into sculptures, finding faces hidden in their nebulous forms. He read zealously and meditated on the wisdom of Greek philosophers and literary prodigies. He took pictures of the island, marveling at how it changes from hour to hour, season to season.Morandi collects juniper logs and shapes them into sculptures. He sells them to tourists and donates the money to NGOs in countries from Africa to Tibet. Though he inhabits a small piece of land, he is acutely aware of the world at large.During all his years on the island, Morandi says he has never gotten sick, a quality he attributes to “good genes.”This is not unusual for people who spend extensive periods of time alone. Scientists have long posited that solitude generates creativity, and point to generations of artists, poets, and philosophers who produced their greatest works in seclusion from society.But the benefits of solitude may not be universal. “Solitude can be stressful for members of technologically advanced societies who have been trained to believe that aloneness is to be avoided,” writes Pete Suedfeld in Loneliness: A Sourcebook of Current Theory, Research and Therapy. Nonetheless, there are many secular and devotional cultures around the world that venerate and preserve solitude.Morandi is silhoutted against the light of the dying sun—his favorite time of day when the world seems to grow quiet. “We think we’re super-humans and divine creatures, but we’re really nothing in my opinion,” he says. “We must adapt to nature.”When Wi-Fi inevitably found its way to this nearly unpopulated island Morandi adopted it and began sharing his beloved piece of paradise with the world through social media. Embracing this new form of communication is his concession on behalf of a larger purpose—to facilitate a bond between people and nature by exposing them to its beauty. A bond Morandi hopes will motivate people to care for the planet wherever they are.“Love is an absolute consequence of beauty, and vice versa,” Morandi says. “When you love a person deeply you see him or her as beautiful, but not because you see them as physically beautiful … you empathize with them, you’ve become a part of her and she’s become a part of you. It’s the same thing with nature.”Michele Ardu is a photographer based in London. Follow him on Instagram.This story was orginally published July 24, 2017. It was updated April 27, 2021.",
"It’s 3:30 a.m. when I disembark the ferry in a trance after a 10-hour sail from Athens. The air is soft and warm in Amorgos, a pristine island off the coast of Greece. Wooden fishing boats rock against their moors, lit villages dot the high hills, and a sweet scent of sage laces the morning air. Once the day starts, it’s on to the reason I came here: to look for Sister Irini.At sunset, light illuminates the medieval fortress built on a rock jutting from the center of Chora, a village on Amorgos inhabited by a few hundred people.Amorgos's many monasteries, among the oldest in the world, draw tourists by the thousands, mostly from France, Italy, and Greece, and its unparalleled beauty—rough and raw with azure blue seas and sky—cause one to slow down and linger. One tourist has lingered so long she is now a practicing nun.Seven years ago, Sister Irini began transforming a long-abandoned monastery into an oasis. Visitors come throughout the year to walk her bountiful garden lined with Byzantine frescos, to hear her story, and to purchase her magnificent paintings of religious icons. She first came to the island as a young mother and wife 35 years ago; after her husband passed, she chose a new path. Her name is Sister Irini, now, and she remains Amorgos’s only nun.Cloaked in a black habit, she welcomes me on a tour of her home, expressing her love for faith, her garden, and life as a nun. Later, when I ask about her prior name and life, she withholds.“Last names don’t exist as a nun.” Sister Irini takes a long pause. “I had to divorce myself from my brothers and sisters. I waited until my children were independent.”In her monastery's garden, Sister Irini plays with her cat, Omorfoula ("little beautiful one").Sister Irini cares for her plants at the monastery, which she restored herself.Sister Irini moved to Amorgos and took her vows as a Greek Orthodox nun in 2011. She spends her days gardening, painting, and praying, but always welcomes visitors to her monastery, Agios Georgios Valsamitis (or St. George Valsamitis).“It was empty and alone, and I had to work hard to make it paradise,” she says. “It really is paradise!”Valsamitis appears Eden-like after an exhilarating ride up dusty roads, trying to avoid unruly, wandering goats. Its lush shade is a gift in the blistering afternoon sun and the cool landscape: a small miracle. The monastery sits upon an ancient well, previously a water oracle where 17th-century water readers foretold believers’ futures through the blessings of St. George. The Church is opposed to such notions, so the bishop had the well cemented shut in 1967.After her husband passed away and her children became independent, Sister Irini returned to the island she'd visited for so many years. "From the first time I came here, just the smell, the mountains, the blue of the sea ... I felt this is something I want to see again," she says.Still, the 30 fruit trees that Sister Irini lovingly planted are clearly drinking from the spring. As I stroll under the protective boughs of oranges, lemons, apricots, peaches, and olives, cats lounge amid beds of flowers, stretching and yawning without a care in the world.“The cats were sick,” says Sister Irini, “but I brought in doctors and now they’re happy.”It’s not difficult to see what could have first attracted her to a permanent life on Amorgos: It’s a respite from the outer world. Imagine leaving everything behind for a place where the sun-lit sea of diamonds shines by day and sailboats clink beneath a starlit sky at night.A flowering vine drops petals on the streets of Chora.Students in Chora march to commemorate Ohi Day (Day of the No).With only two Motto machines (ATMs) that are often devoid of money, the thousand or so year-round residents simply barter among themselves. Homegrown or fresh-caught food is served alfresco and prepared on the spot, albeit leisurely. Everything in Amorgos moves slower, but it’s worth the wait. Rich coffee brews in copper pots on heated sand. Piping hot baskets of sardines are served with feta cheese—crispy, salted, or chilled—alongside morning-picked tomatoes and olives with warm baked bread.The food tastes of the sea. Unlike Sister Irini’s monastery, most of the island is dry and craggy. I hike two hours on traditional footpaths, lined by ancient stone walls, to the villages of Tholaria, Langkada, and Aegiali to visit the island’s other monasteries—a trek others make in reverse every week to visit Sister Irini in the village of Chora.“Every Saturday the priests come and share eggs and we hug and talk,” says Sister Irini. “It’s one of my favorite things.”The Greek Orthodox priests reside in the island’s more famed monastery. Established by Byzantine emperor Alexius Comnenus in the late 11th century, Hozoviotissa perches high on a cliff. It’s rumored the Louvre has tried to acquire it for years. Gems, jewels, and gold adorn the altar; Rolexes, emeralds, and diamonds gleam in locked glass cabinets, gifts left by spiritually inspired tourists from around the world.Father Theofilos celebrates mass in the church of St. Georgios Valsamitis monastery.The path to Hozoviotissa Monastery winds across the cliffs a thousand feet above the sea. Once one of the wealthiest monasteries in Greece, it was fortified against pirates.Hozoviotissa's white walls gleam in the moonlight. Cells for monks and hermits were built into the rock like "a chest of drawers," described one 19th-century visitor.As magnificent as these lavish gifts may appear, this monastery’s finest blessing may be its unparalleled views of the famous blue cove of Aghia Anna. After a leisurely hour’s hike downhill, I wade through the shallow water into a cool cave, allowing the salty sea to cleanse the day’s heat.In a landscape this heavenly, it’s easy to understand Sister Irini’s choice to devote herself to a simple, holy life.“The quiet, sunrise, sunset—everything!” she says. “I love everything.”Below Hozoviotissa Monastery, the cove of Agia Anna glows at dawn.After landing in Athens, visitors can take the 5:30 p.m. ferry from the Port of Piraeus for the 10-hour sail to Amorgos, where cars are available to rent and can be arranged by your hotel. Lodging varies from five-star hotels to simple bed-and-breakfasts.Must-see stops include Hozoviotissa Monastery, open from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and then again from five to seven (make sure to check the dress code); Aghia Anna, where classic film Le Grande Bleu was shot (avoid midday crowds); and Sister Irini’s own St. George Valsamitis. Sister Irini welcomes tours, which can be arranged by your hotel or online through multiple tour companies.",
"Mules help travelers up the Grand Canyon's South Kaibab Trail.Founded on February 26, 1919, Grand Canyon National Park—enormous, enduring, enchanting—remains one of the most beloved parks in the United States. Check out these seven expert tips to make the most of your trip.The classic way to navigate the canyon’s steep slopes is by mule; South Rim day trips leave from Stone Corral, at the head of Bright Angel Trail.At Phantom Ranch, you’ll also find the only lodging inside the park that isn’t camping (it’s best to book your tour and stay six months in advance).Rafting the Colorado River provides an a glimpse of the park’s history from an adventurous perspective. River runners collide with over 160 world-class rapids on the route and trips can last anywhere from one to 25 days.For one-day visits, the Hermit Road along the South Rim is a seven-mile route that skirts the canyon’s rim and offers excellent glimpses of the Colorado River and labyrinthine twists and turns of the canyon; free buses shuttle you along the route while it’s closed to cars from March to November. The North Rim’s Cape Royal Road is a 23-mile stretch that offers some of the more panoramic perspectives you’ll find anywhere in the canyon, particularly at dawn or dusk. The Vista Encantada overlook opens up to an expanse of scenic countryside, while the natural limestone arch at the Angels Window frames the Colorado River for a perfect snapshot.One of the most photographed views in Zion National Park, and perhaps all of the parks, is the view of the Watchman from the Canyon Junction Bridge. Although it has been shot endless times, and you are sure to be shoulder to shoulder with other photographers during sunset, it is still something everyone must do when visiting the park. My favorite spot is right at the center of the bridge where the river leads the eye to the Watchman in the background.The Rim Trail, which is mostly paved and offers access points by shuttle bus, is the easiest hike to navigate through the inner canyon, with little in the way of elevation change. For a more strenuous hike, opt for the Tonto Trail, which stretches over 95 miles; the 20-plus mile backcountry stretch between Cottonwood Creek and South Kaibab Trail are recommended by our Traveler experts, particularly during the winter when worries about dehydration are less of an issue. (Follow along as two explorers hike 800 miles of magic and misery in the Grand Canyon.)In the North Rim, the Havasupai Indian reservation can be found along the Havasu Trail—its lush oasis provides one of the best places to see the travertine formations. Follow the trail along the creek to the Colorado River to find perfect swimming holes formed by streams and turquoise waterfalls cascading down from the cliffs. But perhaps the best way to appreciate the magnitude of the canyon is to hike from the North Rim to the South Rim via the North Kaibab and Bright Angel Trails; this 23-mile hike is not for the weary. Visit the park’s website for more information on day hikes and backcountry hikes.The canyon's variety of landscape and elevation makes for a hugely diverse mix of flora and fauna. The park counts 355 bird species, 89 mammalian species, and 56 reptile and amphibian species within its expanse; some of the more prevalent animals you’re apt to find are mountain lions, bald eagles, spotted owls, peregrine falcons, trout, catfish, striped bass, bats, coyotes, beavers, canyon treefrogs, red-spotted toads, Woodhouse’s rocky mountain toads, and the California condor, which neared extinction in the 1930s, but is now again thriving in the park.A condor, tagged by scientists to retrieve valuable information, soars over Marble Canyon.Predominant species of plant life include sagebrush, snakeweed, banana and narrowleaf yucca, Indian ricegrass, creosote bush, white bursage, brittle brush, western honey mesquite, blue spruce, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, and mountain ash. Nearly 2,000 species of flora thrive in the park.Designed in 1932 to resemble ancient pueblo towers, the 70-foot-high Desert View Watchtower sits on the highest point on the South Rim and offers one of the best canyon views of the Palisades of the Desert, particularly at sunset. (See ‘sunset wars’ pictures of national parks' amazing skies.)Families with small children can stroll two short hikes easily accessible from the Cape Royal trailhead on the North Rim. Stroll the 0.3 miles from the trailhead to Angels Window, and then onto Cape Royal, where pictorial buttes and rock temples rise from the canyon.Dehydration can occur quickly below the rim, so drink plenty of fluids (about four quarts per day), eat salty snacks, and cache water along the trail for your return trip. Don't hike during the hottest part of the day.Hermit Road is paved and wheelchair accessible; contact the visitors center about vehicle accessibility, which varies during the year. (Visit four of the best wheelchair-accessible trails in U.S. national parks.)If your stomach can take it, plan a visit to the Skywalk, a glass-bottomed balcony that has you suspended 4,000 feet over the canyon floor. Run by the Hualapi Tribe on their reservation site at Grand Canyon West, the trip is about five hours from the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, and entrance fees are charged. Other side trips include visits to Nevada’s Lake Mead, and the 900-year-old pueblos, pottery, and amphitheater left behind by Native Americans at the Wupatki National Monument in Flagstaff, Arizona.",
"The overlook on Toroweap Point offers visitors an expansive view of the Grand Canyon.Established: 1919Size: 1.2 million acres (4,856.23 sq km)Annual Visitors: 6.2 millionVisitor Centers: South Rim, North RimEntrance Fees: $30 per vehicle; $15 per individualImagine the Grand Canyon with no people. Just the psychedelic-colored canyon walls, the wind, and the river silent at the bottom of the gorge. That’s how it must have looked to the Native Americans who lived in and around the Grand Canyon 12,000 years ago, and to the Spanish explorers who laid eyes on the rift in the 16th century.Fast forward to today, when more than six million people a year visit Grand Canyon National Park to experience its visitor centers, mule trips, train tour, helicopter rides, and more. There are so many things to do that it might seem impossible to escape the admiring crowds, but we have a few off-the-beaten-path suggestions.Cruising the Colorado River in a dory instead of a rubber raft may seem like a stately way to travel, but in reality it’s a much wilder ride, not very different from how John Wesley Powell and his team first navigated through the Grand Canyon bottom in 1869. Dories have evolved in design to be nimble and quick to swing around rocks and over rapids, but the boats tend to go through waves rather than over them like a raft would, making for exciting—and wet—adventures. Only a few outfitters are licensed to operate dories on the river. Trips range from five to 18 days, including all meals and riverside camping throughout the trip, and many book a year or more in advance.Stargazing in Grand Canyon is an exceptional experience. The clarity of the night skies was recognized in summer 2019 when the park was officially designated as an International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association. In preparing for the recognition, the Park Service converted thousands of lights across the park to dark-sky compliant options. Not only does this afford guests a better view of the heavens above the cliffs, but it benefits wildlife that can be disrupted by artificial light. Every June, visitors can take advantage of star parties, with telescopes set up for free use, plus astronomer talks and photo workshops.The Little Colorado River (at right) meets the bigger Colorado River in the park, marking the beginning of the Grand Canyon's central section.The Shoshone Point turnout doesn’t overlook the canyon—most cars whiz past it on their way to the money shot—but the relatively easy 2.2-mile trail from the parking lot to the edge is one of the least crowded along the popular South Rim. The view from the end is wonderful: well worth the moderate hike.Hiking below the rim appeals to very few visitors to Grand Canyon National Park—less than 5 percent venture away from the top. But there are several spots that lend themselves to a quick dip down into the canyon to experience looking up at the walls, superb examples of the land’s reaction to weather over the millennia. One of them is the South Kaibab Trail. For those who don’t want to trek the six-plus miles to the canyon floor, Ooa-Aah Point about a third of the way down offers spectacular views.Toroweap Overlook, the North Rim’s most remote viewpoint of the canyon, is not for the faint of heart but it pretty much guarantees a unique experience. At the edge of the overlook is nothing but air; 3,000 feet down runs the largest rapid on the Colorado River. Ancient lava flows and black cinder cones invoke a time when volcanic eruptions sculpted the canyon into what we see now. Just getting to the overlook is a challenge; the road is unpaved and studded with rocks that require a high-clearance vehicle to drive. And if you’re looking to stay at Tuweep, the campground at the overlook, you’ll need a backcountry permit and plenty of preparation to stay in this area with no services.With its exhibits on the park’s natural and human history, Grand Canyon Visitor Center on the South Rim is an excellent starting point. You can leave your vehicle there and walk or take a shuttle bus to other landmarks along the South Rim. Right behind the visitor center are Mather Point and the 13-mile Rim Trail to other stunning viewpoints like Yaki Point to the east and Yavapai Point to the west, where a geology museum illuminates nearly two billion years of canyon history.Beyond Yavapai Point (1.3 miles) is the Village and the eclectic architecture of its historic structures, which together comprise a national historic landmark district. Many of the buildings were designed by pioneering female architect Mary Colter, including the distinctive Hopi House (1905), an homage to the indigenous architecture of the Southwest that now houses the park’s largest souvenir store and a Native American art gallery. Verkamp’s Visitor Center (1906) harbors a bookstore, information desk, and exhibits on the canyon’s pioneer history. Among other noteworthy structures are the Kolb Studio (1904) and Lookout Studio (1914), both vintage photo studios that now blend shopping and exhibit space.The village train station (1910) is the terminus for the historic Grand Canyon Railway, a scenic passenger line that runs 64 miles through the pine forest and meadows of the Coconino Plateau between the South Rim and Williams, Arizona. Passengers can ride the train as a day trip to the Grand Canyon or combine it with overnights at South Rim lodging.During the slower winter months, you can drive all the way to Hermits Rest. But during the busy peak season (March 1 to November 30), Hermit Road is closed to private vehicles west of the village. That leaves hiking and the shuttle bus as the two means to explore this awesome 7-mile stretch of the South Rim. “Must see” stops along the way include the Abyss with its 3,000-foot vertical drop-off and Pima Point, where you can see a slice of the milk-chocolate-colored Colorado River far below. At the end of the road, Hermits Rest is a faux frontier cabin (host to a gift shop and snack bar) fashioned by Colter in 1914.Grand Canyon aficionados debate which overlook along this stretch is best, from the aptly named Grandview Point to Moran Point with its view of Hance Rapids and Lipan Point, where you can gaze down on that big bend in the Colorado River. Tucked between the turnoffs is the small but interesting Tusayan Museum with exhibits on local Native American culture. Behind the museum, a short self-guided trail leads to the Tusayan Ruin, the remains of a 12th-century Puebloan village and one of 4,300 archaeological sites so far identified inside the national park.Inspired by the Puebloan style, Colter fashioned the nearby Desert View Watchtower in 1932 as a perch for an even higher view down into the canyon. Eighty-five steps lead to an observation deck that sits more than 5,000 feet above the canyon floor, past murals of ancient Native American life rendered by Hopi artist Fred Kabotie. A snack bar, store, and gas station round out Desert View’s amenities.From Desert View Tower, the drive to the Grand Canyon’s North Rim is nearly 200 miles. But it’s a journey into a different world. For starters, the North Rim averages a thousand feet higher than its southern counterpart. That may not seem like a lot, but that extra elevation makes a huge difference in climate, vegetation, and even the animals you come across. The North Rim is slightly cooler in the summer and often inaccessible during winter because of snowstorms. Tourist facilities are open only from May 15 to October 15.The Visitor Center is a great place to start, especially if you plan on hiking the rim trails or driving the spur roads. Grand Canyon Lodge (1937) balances on the very edge of the chasm, and its back patio offers perhaps the best place in the entire park to sit, stare, and contemplate the geological wonder that spreads out before you. For an even more vertiginous view, hike the short (0.5-mile) trail to Bright Angel Point.Scattered around the village are trailheads to paths including the 4.7-mile Uncle Jim Loop, the 9.6-mile Widforss Trail to a very secluded overlook, and the 9.8-mile Ken Patrick Trail all the way over to Point Imperial, the highest point on the North Rim, with views into the canyon’s northeastern corner. You can also drive to Point Imperial via Cape Royal Road, which switchbacks up onto the Walhalla Plateau and other celebrated panoramas like Vista Encantada and Angels Window. Adventurous drivers can test their mettle on the rough, unpaved road that leads out to Sublime Point, 18 miles west of the village. Four-wheel drive and high clearance are essential; a tow strap and saw (for cutting down fallen trees) are highly recommended.Given the absence of roads, there are only three ways to explore the Grand Canyon below the rims: hiking, mule trips, and river flat trips.Around 40,000 people a year backpack into the canyon for overnight stays that can vary from one night to several weeks. Far more people are day hikers who venture a short distance down one of three main trails for a taste of what it’s like to stare up at the imposing canyon walls.Whether on a multi-day trek or an hour-long hike, walkers should always check out trail and weather conditions before plunging down the path. The most timely and accurate information is available from the national park visitor centers or the Backcountry Information Center on the South Rim.Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim is the safest and best maintained route into the canyon and includes shade structures, emergency phones, toilets, and taps for refilling water bottles. With a trailhead just west of the South Rim Village, the Bright Angel dives quickly downward via a series of switchbacks to Indian Garden (4.8 miles) and a suspension bridge over the Colorado River to Bright Angel Campground (9.5 miles) and nearby Phantom Ranch. The route more or less follows a path that Native Americans and 19th-century prospectors took into the canyon.The only path into the canyon from the opposite rim is the North Kaibab Trail, a 14-mile hoof down to Phantom Ranch and the river. Several trails wind through the canyon, including the rugged, multi-day Tonto Trail, which wanders 70 miles from east to west below the South Rim.Mule trips into the canyon are offered from both rims. The South Rim features day trips and multi-day pack trips with stops at Phantom Ranch; the North Rim offers only rides.Hotels South RimReservations: 888-297-2757 or grandcanyonlodges.com• El Tovar: Historic national park lodge opened in 1905 by the Fred Harvey Company; air conditioning, restaurant, bar• Bright Angel Lodge: Modern rooms and rustic cabins on the edge of the canyon, designed by Mary Colter in 1935; restaurant, saloon, soda fountain• Phantom Ranch: Very basic cabins and dorm rooms, and shared baths.

"On a clear night in 1994, an earthquake rumbled beneath Los Angeles and caused a city-wide power outage just before dawn. Startled awake, some residents who had stumbled outside called various emergency centers and a local observatory to report a mysterious cloud overhead.That weird object turned out to be the band of the Milky Way, our home galaxy, which had long been obscured from view by the city’s lights.Arguably, the light bulb is the most transformative invention humans have introduced to this planet. By flicking a switch or pushing a button, we can push back the veil that would naturally shroud our lives each night. Now, we work long after the sun sinks below the horizon. We play games outside until the hours stretch into double digits. We more safely roam city streets after dark.A Sky Quality Meter measures the nighttime brightness in central Los Angeles; results lower than 20 indicate more light polluted skies. Researcher Christopher Kyba suspects that such ground-based measurements are more accurate than satellite-based assessments, which currently cannot detect certain wavelengths of light.Atop a hill overlooking Los Angeles, the Griffith Observatory’s night skies are veiled by light. Astronomers are not the only ones suffering from light pollution’s effects—harmful impacts have been documented in sea turtles, birds, bats, corals, and dozens of other species.But if light bulbs have a dark side, it’s that they have stolen the night. The excess light we dump into our environments is endangering ecosystems by harming animals whose life cycles depend on dark. We’re endangering ourselves by altering the biochemical rhythms that normally ebb and flow with natural light levels. And in a primal sense, we’ve lost our connection to nighttime skies, the tapestries into which our ancestors wove their star-studded stories, timed the planting and harvesting of crops, and deduced the physical laws governing the cosmos.“The disappearance of the night sky is tied up in our ever more fast-paced world,” says Amanda Gormley of the Tucson-based International Dark-Sky Association. “We lose something essential; we lose a part of ourselves when we lose access to the night sky. We lose that sense of stillness and awe that should be right over our heads every night.”Now, as the consequences of light pollution tiptoe from the shadows and into the spotlight, cities, regulatory agencies, and conservation groups are agitating for solutions. And in some areas, substantial improvements are already in place, powered by a new wave of cheaper, more energy-efficient light bulbs.The International Dark-Sky Association defines light pollution as “the inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light.” That can take many forms, including glare, or excessive brightness; sky glow, which drowns out the night sky over urban areas; light trespass, or stray light falling where it is not needed; and clutter, or confusing groups of bright light sources.Though it may not be as immediately toxic as a chemical spill, light pollution is now among the most chronic environmental perturbations on Earth. In 2016, scientists estimated that 99 percent of the continental United States and Europe experience some amount of light pollution. Based on observations from the Suomi NPP satellite, a third of humankind cannot see the Milky Way, including nearly 80 percent of North Americans. Another study from 2017 suggests that worldwide, light pollution increased by roughly two percent a year between 2012 and 2016—that might not sound like much, but percentages compound.That’s not a sunrise: The nighttime lights of Los Angeles are visible from a rural road 90 miles away. Recent estimates suggest that 99 percent of U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted night skies.“You would think that environmental organizations would be all over light pollution, because it’s just such a complete waste,” says Christopher Kyba of the German Research Center for Biosciences. “It’s a place where you can reduce energy consumption with basically no loss to anyone.”For indoor lights, the switch to new kinds of bulbs has often been about energy savings, as homeowners moved from conventional incandescent bulbs to cheaper, brighter alternatives such as compact fluorescents. Now, light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are fueling an indoor and outdoor lighting revolution that could see energy consumption drop dramatically both for individual consumers and entire cities. When Los Angeles recently replaced more than 150,000 streetlights with LEDs, the city saved roughly $8 million dollars annually, or more than 60 percent on energy costs.But while LEDs are cheaper than previous alternatives, they come with hidden costs. People tend to overuse them and over-illuminate areas, and without proper shielding, these much brighter bulbs cast large amounts of wasted light in all directions. What’s more, the inexpensive white LEDs often found in street lights emit wavelengths of blue light that bounce around in the atmosphere, potentially increasing sky glow. These wavelengths are also known to affect animals—including humans—more dramatically than lights emitting in other parts of the spectrum.Unfortunately, measuring the actual impact of LEDs from orbit has been tricky, because most Earth-observing satellites are not sensitive to those wavelengths of light. In Kyba’s 2017 study, which relied on orbiting satellites, light pollution in the United States seemed to remain more or less flat. Kyba suspects that our skies are actually getting brighter, and he attributes the apparent flatness to satellites that can’t see blue-white LEDs.He and others say that dimmer, warmer, and shielded LEDs could be hugely beneficial for both dark skies and energy budgets.“Done well, LEDs could save the planet, in the sense of reining in light pollution,” says astronomer John Barentine, also of International Dark-Sky Association. “Done carelessly, it could be devastating.”Beijing’s Olympic Park is brilliantly lit with blue-white LEDs suspended high above the ground. China has a rich astronomical history, a growing space program, and observatories sprinkled throughout its landscapes—but the band of the Milky Way is invisible in and around its capital.Covered in a blanket of low-lying clouds, Tak Bai, Thailand, is heavily illuminated at night, blocking the view of twinkling stars overhead that becomes visible only from outside the city.One autumn morning back in 1990, just after dawn, Michael Mesure roamed Toronto’s financial district, walking the streets between the city’s tallest, brightest buildings. It was a fairly normal routine for Mesure, who often spent his daybreak hours collecting and cataloging the previous night’s casualties and attempting to rescue and rehabilitate the injured.“Everywhere I looked, there were just bodies lying all over the sidewalks,” he recalls.As in many cities, Toronto’s nighttime lights are frequently lethal to birds. Blinded by glare or lured by artificial lights, disoriented birds fly into gleaming windows or smash into buildings, sometimes tumbling hundreds of feet to the pavement below.Mesure, who co-founded the nonprofit Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP), estimates that Toronto’s buildings kill tens of thousands of birds a year. Sparrows, ovenbirds, juncos, warblers, kinglets, and creepers are just some of the species on the casualty list. A good proportion of those fatalities happen during the day, but artificial lighting makes the night deadly, as well—and the effect can be surprisingly tough to see. On Mesure’s dawn patrol back in the ‘90s, he noticed gulls scavenging the bird bodies.“It’s no wonder people don’t know this is an issue,” he says. “By the time people come to work, all the birds are gone.”A long-exposure image of the Sydney Opera House reveals the ghostly trails of birds flying above the structure’s massive flood lights. Local and migrating species are attracted to artificial night lights that often lead them astray, resulting in hundreds of millions of avian deaths each year.Today, FLAP’s volunteers still patrol those six square blocks of the financial district, scraping data from city sidewalks before the gulls and cleaners can get to them. They’ve found that the bulk of the fatalities happen during spring and fall, when artificial lights dramatically affect migratory birds, particularly those that travel overnight and are lured into urban environments by bright city lights. Multiply Toronto’s fatalities by every similar city in North America, and it’s apparent that excess light kills millions of migrating birds each year.Even far from the throngs of urban downtowns, our thirst for light is claiming lives. Researchers have already identified harmful impacts on a shocking array of non-urban species, including bats, insects, plants, fish, turtles, marine invertebrates including corals, and even primates.In Australia, Kylie Robert studies the reproductive cycle of the tammar wallaby. This small marsupial synchronizes its fertility with fading light levels after the summer solstice, resulting in births six weeks afterward, and subsequent high demands on mothers when food resources are at their peak.“Wallabies only require a few nights with as little as three minutes of decreased light to activate reproduction,” says Robert, of Melbourne’s La Trobe University. “There are studies 147 years apart describing median birth dates within five days of each other.”But Robert saw something different in the two wallaby populations she studied on Garden Island. One population lived near a naval base bathed in high-pressure sodium lights, and the other lived in undisturbed bush, where the waxing and waning moon caused the greatest fluctuation in nighttime light.Over five years of study, the bushland wallabies produced offspring right on cue, six weeks post-solstice. But the urban population was late by a whopping four weeks, which could lead to a mismatch between peak offspring demands and food availability. This urban population made up for the disparity by snacking on irrigated lawns. Robert suspects that nighttime lights suppress wallaby hormones that normally peak during increasing periods of darkness.“We expect to see the same effects in other seasonally breeding species that have their reproductive activity cued by change in light levels,” Robert says.For millennia, the rhythmic shifting between day and night ruled our physiology, too, triggering biological cues that help us sleep at night, wake up in the morning, and stay healthy.“Nighttime physiology depends on dark. It does not depend on sleep,” says Richard Stevens, an epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who has studied the links between light pollution and human health for decades. “What we need is a longer period of physiological nighttime.”The connection between light and biology starts with photons striking our retinas, triggering signals that reach a knot of neurons known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus; that knot is a crucial regulator of the brain’s pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin. Through this pathway, melatonin normally begins rising at sundown and peaks around midnight, unleashing a cascade of reactions that regulates sleep-wake cycles, lowers body temperature, slows metabolism, and increases leptin, a hormone that reduces appetite.“It was very important for humans beings not to get hungry in the middle of the night, because if you’re foraging for food, you’re gonna become food,” Stevens says.Whether it’s a computer screen, bright bathroom light, or intense street lights shining in our windows, indoor and outdoor electric lights interfere with those circadian rhythms by stunting the normal ebb and flow of melatonin. Obesity is one consequence of light messing with our nighttime physiology, as it is likely linked to persistently low levels of leptin. Based on a number of studies, low melatonin levels and circadian disruption are also thought to play a role in heart disease, diabetes, depression, and cancer—particularly breast cancer, for which Stevens says the data are particularly compelling.The consequences are particularly profound in nighttime shift workers, such as truck drivers and flight attendants, who are case studies in messed up circadian biology. In 2007, the World Health Organization actually declared shift work a risk factor for cancer. And in 2012, the American Medical Association warned that pervasive use of nighttime lighting “creates potentially harmful health effects and/or hazardous situations.”The psychological impact of losing the night sky also should not be underestimated.Dacher Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, says that the star-splashed canvas rotating overhead on clear nights elicits a sense of wonder and awe that may translate into positive human behaviors. In laboratory studies, participants who’d recently experienced that sensation scored higher on assessments of scientific reasoning and were kinder, more altruistic, and less materialistic.“Philosophers have written about how a big beautiful sky makes you feel like you’re part of something big, like it’s sacred, like it’s purposeful,” he says. “By contrast, a smoggy sky that is closing in on you or a night sky that’s filled with pollution kind of weighs heavily on your consciousness.”If the battle against light pollution had a mascot, it would probably be a baby sea turtle. The damaging effects of coastal light on these threatened creatures are perhaps the most commonly known. But in Florida, at least, people racing to save the sea turtles are finally turning the tide.Among other navigational aids, sea turtle hatchlings use moonlight reflecting off wave tops as a guide to the sea. But highrises, resorts, bars, malls, restaurants, and homes glitter along the same Florida coastlines where more than 90 percent of sea turtles nest in the United States. Those bright lights create countless false moons and alluringly bright horizons, and the tiny turtles get disoriented and wander into roads or properties in huge numbers. For a hatchling, each minute on land means dodging an array of winged, wheeled, and walking dangers. When the sun comes up, a disoriented, land-locked turtle is almost literally toast—dehydrated, overheated, and easy pickings for predators. Even among those that make it to the ocean, as few as one in ten thousand will survive to adulthood.“There are tens of thousands of hatchling disorientations every year,” says David Godfrey, executive director of the Gainesville-based Sea Turtle Conservancy. “Light pollution is one of the two highest sources of mortality for hatching sea turtles along our coastlines.”·   Use lower temperature LEDs and compact fluorescents.·   Use dimmers, motion sensors, or timers on outdoor lighting.·   Use outdoor lighting fixtures that shield the light source to minimize glare and light trespass.·   Turn off unnecessary indoor lighting, particularly in empty buildings at night.·   Maintain as much overnight dark as possible. Leave the bathroom lights off if you must get up, or use a dim red light that will not disrupt your nighttime physiology.·   Turn off devices an hour before bedtime. When available, use apps that filter out blue wavelengths emitted by your handheld electronics.·   If you live in a high-rise building, use drapes or blackout curtains to reduce bird collisions.So, he and his colleagues have been slowly re-lighting the Florida coast, with a little help from turtle-friendly lighting ordinances and nearly $10 million in oil spill recovery funds allocated by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. At no cost to property owners, they’re starting with disorientation hot spots and properties that existed before the lighting regulations passed. It’s been nearly 10 years since the project started, and Godfrey says property owners are so pleased with the newer, more energy-efficient lights that once a house or two adopts turtle-friendly lighting, neighboring properties often do the same.The new lighting design follows three main principles that can protect not only turtles, but also humans and other wildlife. Some of these principles can be adopted by individual homeowners, while others require municipalities to swap out street lights and other public installations.One key step is keeping lights low to the ground. Instead of lighting a parking lot with 25-foot poles, lights just 10 feet tall will do the trick, Godfrey says. For walkways, foot-lights along the ground are just as effective as overhead lamps. Light pollution experts also suggest shielding light fixtures so they directly illuminate their target, rather than wastefully casting light in every direction. Homeowners might also consider installing timers, dimmers, or motion sensors that turn on outdoor lights only when they are needed.Most importantly for light-sensitive animals, outdoor fixtures should use longer-wavelength LEDs rather than bright-white lights. Turtle hatchlings, for instance, do not respond to bulbs that throw a warm amber glow. That type of light is actually better for humans, as well, based on studies of how our bodies respond to the blue-white light common in newer TVs and smartphones.Though the initial retrofit might swallow some dollars, cost-savings in the long run often add up to energy bills that are 70 percent lower than before, Godfrey says. Along the Florida seashore, installing turtle-friendly exterior lights for a single-family home costs between $1,500 and $4,000; a small apartment building might be on the order of $25,000, and a large resort or condo complex could be between $30,000 and $80,000. To date, the group has worked with hundreds of properties along 25 miles of sandy beach, while monitoring the rates of hatchling disorientations pre- and post-retrofit.“In front of every property that we’ve retrofitted, the disorientation rate has gone to zero,” he says, noting that they’re working with properties in other sea turtle nesting hot spots, such as Costa Rica. “As long as we have the money available, we’re going to keep doing this project.”Park ranger and chief of education Patrick Taylor leads a night sky photography session inside the Death Valley dark sky park.Some areas of upper New England are sparsely populated, meaning that light pollution is low and skies are among the darkest in the U.S. Here, stargazers gather in Maine for an annual summer star party known as Astronomy Retreat. The long-exposure image captures star trails produced as Earth rotates, pinpointing Polaris, the north star, in the center.As the consequences of light pollution have become more visible, lighting regulations have started to evolve. Canada passed bird-friendly lighting (and construction) laws in the mid-1990s, and now numerous cities—including Toronto, Washington, D.C., and New York—participate in lights-out campaigns during peak migration seasons. And in 2016, the American Medical Association responded to the growing body of evidence suggesting that intense LEDs are harmful to human health by recommending that communities change streetlights to “minimize and control blue-rich environmental lighting.”Entire cities are even re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim the night and decrease energy waste. Flagstaff, Arizona, was the first city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by the International Dark-Sky Association, and Chicago is in the process of retrofitting its fixtures.So far, hesitations about dimmer, sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by the data; in Chicago’s West Garfield Park, more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime. And anecdotally, people are finding that less glaring lighting makes it easier to see in unlit areas, because our eyes adapt more quickly to the dark.For some cities, eliminating light pollution is also a way to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity’s connection to the night sky. Consider the town of Jasper, Alberta. Nestled in the remote Canadian Rockies, Jasper is a haven for those who love the mountains, wildlife, and the outdoors. Just a few minutes drive outside town, stargazers can see a dazzling array of nighttime wonders, from oft-hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and the aurora borealis.Since 2010, the city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in the fall that brings in thousands of people. But Jasper residents aren’t content to have the nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders. The town is now working with Lumican, a Canadian company that partners with the International Dark-Sky Association, to re-do all its streetlights. Slated to start this summer, the town’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin, which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths.“What caught our attention at first was how horrible all these new LED street lights looked; so glary, prison-like, and overly bright,” says Lumican’s Lara Mitchell. When she realized that such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems, the company turned toward fighting light pollution.Throughout North America and Europe, dark sky parks are on the rise, and festivals like Jasper’s are flourishing. People are beginning to reconnect with the sparkling canvas that swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales that will help humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty—if we choose to use them.Christopher Kyba, the scientist who studies light pollution on a global level, points to van Gogh’s “Cafe Terrace at Night” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene.“This is the dream of what you want to have—nice, warm, uniform lighting. You can see lots of stars up above, the facades are unlit,” he says. “You look a hundred-something years in the past to see the idealized lighting.”",
"Saguaro National ParkJoshua Tree National ParkIt was an innocuous opening salvo: On May 5, an Instagram post boasted that Saguaro National Park has “the best sunsets in the world.” Taking offense, Joshua Tree National Park fired back. The #parksunsetwars had begun.The battle begins: Comments on the May 5 Saguaro National Park post show the initial rift.Spontaneous banter between two parks’ social media teams turned into a week-long hashtag challenge, with other national parks—from Grand Canyon to Gettysburg—joining the fray. Initially drawing from their own stock of photos, the official accounts at Saguaro and Joshua Tree soon began reposting the sunset snaps shared by their enthusiastic followers. [Can you fly with a mummified head? Ask the TSA’s cheeky Instagram.]“We were very happy to show Joshua Tree just how awesome the sunsets out here are,” says Sharlot Hart, acting lead interpreter at Saguaro, who’s had a hand in the campaign. (Her colleague, Lauren Nichols, was the one to make the fateful post; now on leave, “she probably doesn’t even know what she started,” Hart says.)One of the most photographed views in Zion National Park, and perhaps all of the parks, is the view of the Watchman from the Canyon Junction Bridge. Although it has been shot endless times, and you are sure to be shoulder to shoulder with other photographers during sunset, it is still something everyone must do when visiting the park. My favorite spot is right at the center of the bridge where the river leads the eye to the Watchman in the background.Saguaro National Park, whose two wings embrace Tucson, Arizona, isn’t one of the big-name parks. But its stunning sunsets more than hold their own against those in Joshua Tree, its bigger California cousin. No public consensus has yet been reached regarding which park does, in fact, have the superior sunsets.“Just know that we’re right,” says Hart.Nearby festivals like Coachella and Stagecoach draw extra visitors from the Instagramming crowd to Joshua Tree, and like many NPS officials, they’re trying to make the connection, using pretty pictures to communicate visiting information, fun facts, and safety tips.“We’re like, ‘Please don’t touch the cholla cactus,’” laughs Kristi Rugg, media branch chief at Joshua Tree. “‘Please be careful when you’re hiking; it gets really hot.’”Joshua Tree National ParkSaguaro National ParkA short trip from major cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Diego, Joshua Tree has seen attendance triple over the last decade. Over three million people are expected to visit this year, Rugg says. But it’s also one of 17 big-name parks whose fees may soon double following a 2017 NPS proposal, intended to provide funds for overdue maintenance, that has raised concerns about accessibility.National parks have been exhaustively hailed as America’s “best idea,” and modern science only adds another voice to the choir. While three days in nature can give a much-needed break to overstressed brains, even a little green time has health and cognition benefits. Scientists and NPS officials alike have argued in favor of keeping the parks open to all. [Learn how climate change will shape the parks of tomorrow.]“It’s not all about [the rangers], or the people going into the backcountry,” Hart says. “We’re national parks. We’re the people’s parks. So getting people out to take their own sunset pictures, and have that pride in public lands, is awesome.”The sunset wars are reaching a détente—“this is a war where everyone wins,” a recent Saguaro post graciously notes—but the rangers aren’t done yet. That post also asks followers to suggest the topic of the next battle.My vote? #parkstarwars.Saguaro National ParkJoshua Tree National Park",
"The saguaro cactus is more than just a symbol of the American West—it provides shelter, nesting areas, and food for many animals. Arizona's Saguaro National Park draws hardy hikers and horseback riders.Symbol of the American Southwest and North America's largest cactus, the saguaro's imposing stature and uplifted arms give it a regal presence. Perhaps that's why this burly giant, whose only bits of exuberance are seasonal blossoms and fig-like fruits at the tip of its limbs, has been dubbed the "desert monarch."Carnegiea gigantean is the trademark of the Sonoran Desert, whose basins and ranges rumple 120,000 square miles of northwestern Mexico, southern Arizona, and southeastern California. Saguaro National Park is composed of two sections. The westerly Tucson Mountain District embraces about 24,000 acres of the hotter, drier, less vegetated "low" Sonoran ecosystem, which occurs at an elevation around 3,000 feet. Thirty miles east, on the other side of Tucson's urban sprawl, is the 67,000-acre Rincon Mountain District, which occupies loftier ground and has a cooler, slightly wetter "high desert" environment. Most of it is inaccessible except by foot or on horseback. Here the terrain inclines from saguaro forests into nearly pristine woodlands of oak and pine. Hikers pressing on to higher elevations find Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and solitude.The Sonoran Desert's extreme temperatures, perennial drought, frequent lightning, banshee winds, and voracious predators keep the saguaro forever at the limit of its endurance. Odds against survival rival a lottery: Though the cactus annually produces tens of thousands of pinhead-size seeds—some 40 million over a life that may last two centuries—few ever even sprout. Even fewer seedlings achieve the grandeur of towering 50 feet and weighing up to 16,000 pounds.Though the saguaro may be the park's centerpiece, after wet winters the spring wildflower display can be breathtaking. The brilliant gold of the Mexican poppy is often the first-noticed bloom, while penstemons, lupines, desert marigolds, brittlebushes, and globe mallows contribute their lively colors of red, lilac, blue, and yellow. Many trees, shrubs, and cactuses also bloom, including creosote bushes, paloverdes, ocotillos, chollas, and hedgehogs. Saguaros bloom in late spring.Saguaro West: From Tucson take Speedway Boulevard west to Gates Pass Road, turning right on Kinney Road. (Gates Pass not recommended for buses, RVs, and towed vehicles; instead take Ariz. 86 west from Tucson to Kinney.) Saguaro East: Take Broadway Boulevard east from central Tucson to Old Spanish Trail. Airport: Tucson.Year-round. From October through April, temperatures reach the upper 60s to mid-70s and can drop below freezing overnight. From May through September, highs routinely exceed 100°F. July through September is characterized by brief, fierce thunderstorms. Saguaros bloom nightly from late April into June.On a one-day visit, begin early and view the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum before heading to Saguaro West; then pause at the Red Hills Visitor Center for an overview. Take the Bajada Scenic Loop Drive, stopping en route to walk the paved Desert Discovery Nature Trail. Return to Tucson, continuing east to Saguaro's Rincon Mountain District. Take the Cactus Forest Drive and walk the Desert Ecology Trail. For a scenic rest stop along the drive, visit Mica View Picnic Area.",
"Southern California's Joshua Tree National Park is best known for its iconic flora. But there's much more to explore.Location: California Established: October 31, 1994 Size: 794,000 acresAnnual Visitors: 2.8 millionVisitor Centers: Joshua Tree, Oasis, Cottonwood, Black RockEntrance fee: $30 vehicles; $15 individualsnps.gov/jotrAn enduring symbol of the Mojave Desert, Yucca brevifolia might be the namesake of this national park in the desert east of Los Ange­les, but it’s certainly far from the only thing to see at Joshua Tree. Dozens of trails are open to hiking, biking, and horseback riding, and the stony terrain makes it one of America’s rock­climbing meccas. Spring brings a carpet of wildflow­ers. And the superclear desert night sky makes the park an oasis for stargazing.The park embraces parts of two distinct deserts—the Mojave and Sonoran—as it tumbles down from the heights into the Coachella Valley near Palm Springs. These two desert systems divide California's southernmost national park into two arid ecosystems of profoundly contrasting appearance. The key to their differences is elevation.The Colorado, the western reach of the vast Sonoran Desert, thrives below 3,000 feet on the park’s gently declining eastern flank, where temperatures are usually higher. Considered “low desert,” compared to the loftier, wetter, and more vegetated Mojave “high desert,” the Colorado seems sparse and forbidding. It begins at the park’s midsection, sweeping east across empty basins stubbled with creosote bushes. Occasionally decorated by “gardens” of flowering ocotillo and cholla cactus, it runs across arid Pinto Basin into a parched wilderness of broken rock in the Eagle and Coxcomb Mountains.Many newcomers among the 1.3 million visitors who pass through each year are surprised by the abrupt transition between the Colorado and Mojave ecosystems. Above 3,000 feet, the Mojave section claims the park’s western half, where giant branching yuccas thrive on sandy plains studded by massive granite monoliths and rock piles. These are among the most intriguing and photogenic geological phenomena found in California’s many desert regions.Joshua Tree’s human history commenced sometime after the last ice age with the arrival of the Pinto people, hunter-gatherers who may have been part of the Southwest’s earliest cultures. They lived in Pinto Basin, which though inhospitably arid today, had a wet climate and was crossed by a sluggish river some 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. Nomadic groups of Indians seasonally inhabited the region when harvests of pinyon nuts, mesquite beans, acorns, and cactus fruit offered sustenance. Bedrock mortars—holes ground into solid rock and used to pulverize seeds during food preparation—are scattered throughout the Wonderland of Rocks area south of the Indian Cove camping site.A flurry of late 19th-century gold-mining ventures left ruins; some are accessible by hiking trails, or unmaintained roads suited only to four-wheel-drive vehicles and mountain bikes.There are only three ways visitors can enter the park: from Yucca Valley in the west, Twenty­nine Palms in the north, and Cottonwood Springs in the south. The main Visitor Center is actu­ally outside the park, in the nearby town of Joshua Tree. Although the name seems like an oxymoron, Park Boulevard runs from the visitor cen­ter to Lost Horse Valley in the heart of the park, where three short interpretive trails (Hidden Valley, Barker Dam, and Cap Rock) are a great introduction to Joshua Tree’s natural and human history.More challenging trails can be accessed from the Hidden Valley area, including the eight-­mile Boy Scout Trail into the boul­der­strewn Wonderland of Rocks and the 35­-mile California Riding and Hiking Trail (normally done as a two­- or three-day backpack trip). Another trail ascends to the summit of 5,456­-foot Ryan Mountain. Or cruise the paved road to Keys View at the crest of the Little San Bernardino Mountains for a mile-­high vista of the Coachella Valley, Salton Sea, and San Andreas Fault—a view that’s especially enchanting after dark when Palm Springs sparkles with millions of lights.Park Boulevard continues over Sheep Pass into Queen Valley and another Joshua tree forest. The 18-­mile Motor Geology Road runs south through the valley, with 16 stops along the way that explain how the park’s dramatic landscape was formed. Anchoring the valley’s eastern edge is eerie Skull Rock, a natural formation that looks like a skeleton’s head. Exiting the valley, Park Boule­vard makes a sharp turn to the north and a rendezvous with a lush palm grove, the Oasis of Mara, located beside the Oasis Visitor Center.Alternatively, you can drive Pinto Basin Road into the park’s lesser­known eastern expanse where other iconic desert plants—cholla cactus, ocotillo, cottonwood trees, and California fan palms—over­shadow the Joshuas. Cottonwood Visitor Center anchors the park’s southeast corner and a hiking area that includes trails to Mastodon Peak (3 miles) and the remote Lost Palms Oasis (7.5 miles). Just outside the park, the General Patton Memorial Museum at Chiriaco Summit includes a large collection of battle tanks and mementoes of the gener­al’s military exploits.The west and north park entrances are at the towns of Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. From Los Angeles, take I-10 east to Calif. 62 (Twentynine Palms Hwy.) to Twentynine Palms (about 140 miles total). The south entrance is located at Cottonwood Spring, approximately 25 miles east of Indio off I-10. Call +1 760 367 5500 for recorded directions. Airports: Palm Springs, Los Angeles.Joshua Tree is an all-year park. Temperatures are most comfortable in the spring and fall, with an average high and low of 85°F and 50°F. Winter brings cooler days, around 60°F, and freezing nights. Summers are hot, with midday temperatures frequently above 100°F, and ground temperatures reaching 180°F. The Mojave Desert zone on the park’s western half is on average 11 degrees cooler than the Colorado. In winter, snow may blanket the Mojave's higher elevations.Spring blooming periods vary according to winter precipitation and temperatures, usually beginning in February at lower elevations and peaking park-wide in March and April, although cactuses may bloom into June. (Check with park headquarters.) For up-to-date recorded wildflower information, visit www.nps.gov/jotr.The park’s premier attractions—forests of giant branching yuccas known as Joshua trees, massive rock formations, fan palm oases, and seasonal gardens of cholla and ocotillo—can be enjoyed on a leisurely half-day auto tour that includes both “high” and “low” desert zones—although most of your time will be spent in your car. Scenic paved roads lead to viewpoints, all campgrounds, and trailheads. Roadside interpretive exhibits have pull-outs and parking areas, and offer insights into the region’s complex desert ecology, wildlife, and human history.If you plan to explore the park by mountain bike, you would be wise to avoid the main paved roads, which are narrow and without shoulders. You’ll find far greater solitude and safety cycling the park’s backcountry dirt roads, many of which, like those in Queen Valley, date from the area’s 19th-century homestead and goldmining era. Be sure to acquire reliable information from headquarters about your route, however, as soft sand and occasional steep climbs can make for arduous pedaling.For a half-day visit starting from the park’s northern boundary, take the Park Boulevard loop either from the town of Joshua Tree through the West Entrance Station, or from Twentynine Palms, by way of the North Entrance Station. If the air is clear (ask at the entrance about haze conditions), take the 20-minute side trip to 5,185-foot-high Keys View, which overlooks a vast panorama of arid desert basin and range stretching south into Mexico. If you are starting from Joshua Tree, return to Park Boulevard and continue east over Sheep Pass to Jumbo Rocks, turning right (south) onto Pinto Basin Road for the drive down into long vistas in the Colorado Desert zone. Be sure to stroll the self-guided nature trails through the Cholla Cactus Garden and the Ocotillo Patch.Backtrack to Twentynine Palms and the Oasis Visitor Center, which features a small cactus garden and superb desert ecology interpretive displays. It adjoins the historic Oasis of Mara (one of five spring-fed oases within the park's boundaries), where Indians once found water, shade, food, and game. If you are starting from Twentynine Palms and the Oasis Visitor Center, proceed south as far as the Ocotillo Patch, then backtrack to Park Boulevard and follow it westward to Joshua Tree.There are many hotel options in Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. Joshua Tree also has nine developed campgrounds within the park, including two with designated horse camps. Spots fill up quickly, especially on weekends.

"In early May, the Colorado River separates Arizona from California with a painted stripe of transparent turquoise.The blue water glowed in the sun and the black pavement on the bridge sent up waves of heat that felt pleasant at first, then oppressive. I had the whole desert to cross, but honestly, all I wanted to do was jump in the cool river and float away to Mexico.The car thermometer told me it was 99˚ Fahrenheit outside, the road sign told me it was another 200 miles to civilization, and through the static, the AM radio told me that God loved me.This was the home stretch of Route 66—the last few hundred clicks of my cross-country journey from Chicago to LA—but the Mojave Desert met me like a giant pause, the blank space on the page before that last sentence in a book.The land was beige and slanted, with nothing but miles and miles of mesquite brush and sand that rose slowly to the nameless mountains. The unchanging landscape left me in a state of suspended animation, as if I was only half-awake in a sofa chair and watching some Saturday morning infomercial and not doing eighty down the rumbling highway. Every half-hour, a train would pass on the horizon—containers and boxcars and oil tanks floating single-file in the sand.A hundred miles in, I parked the car on the overpass and stood against the guardrail, watching the tide of trucks and Subarus flowing down I-40 towards Los Angeles. I wondered how many of those motorists knew they were following in the footsteps of a camel caravan. When explorer Kit Carson first crossed this impossibly dry place, he thought camels might help. The idea worked its way into the military, and the United States Camel Corps was born. From the Texas panhandle, the camels traveled, working their way across the driest part of America’s southwest, tracing a path that became the Great Trail, which then became Route 66, which then became United States Interstate 40.All travel is evolution, whether we’re the pathfinders in the desert or the Spring Breaker who follows a century later—the best roads grow wider and bring more and more travelers.The Mojave Desert has not been kind to old Route 66. Although sections of the original road remain open, angry orange signs shout, “Rough Road Ahead”, followed by ten-mile stretches of pockmarked asphalt that shook me so hard, I checked the car for loose screws. From time to time, the old Route 66 emblem pops up like an apparition—a friendly but ghostly reminder that the road is still here and I am still on it. After three weeks of driving, I am still traveling the Mother Road to its final end on America’s long western coast.Barstow came and went, and when I crested the Cajon Pass, the lights came on and the desert lit up like a control panel. The electric city surrounded me, but I stayed on the old road until I couldn’t anymore; until the sign said, “Road Closed” and I was forced onto the ramp that led me into the river of sixteen-lane traffic that flowed down into San Bernardino.",
"Alex Honnold solos "The Nose" on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, California.Since modern recreational climbing began in the late 19th century, breakthroughs derived from new technology and tactics have pushed it in myriad directions.Today, as international competitors at the highest echelons of the sport look forward to climbing’s debut in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, thousands of new enthusiasts have been introduced to the sport thanks to the burgeoning indoor climbing gym industry. Meanwhile, ever growing numbers of elite climber-explorers continue to travel to the far ends of the earth in search of “untouched stone.”To understand what everyone is really up to, it helps to get a grip on the history of climbing and the language that has evolved around it.There is ample evidence that ancient and pre-modern cultures across the globe found reasons to venture onto what today would be considered “technical terrain.” In Mustang, Nepal, archeologists discovered a complex series of burial caves that can only be reached by climbing the faces of imposing vertical cliffs. The American Southwest is riddled with evidence of native tribes living among the mesa cliffs of the region. Most ancient people probably climbed for safety.Three places are credited as the birthplaces of modern recreational climbing: the Peak and Lake Districts of England, the Elbe Sandstone region of Southeastern Germany, and the Dolomites of Northern Italy. By the first decade of the 20th century, pioneers were experimenting with first-generation climbing inventions such as steel carabiners and soft iron ring pitons.Free climbing does not mean climbing without a rope. That would be free-soloing, the high-stakes activity made famous by Free Solo, the Oscar-winning film that documented the most famous free solo ever, Alex Honnold's no-rope ascent of Yosemite's El Capitan.Rather, free climbing means the climber is simply trying to reach the top of his or her objective using only their physical bodies. Safety systems such as a rope or bouldering pad may be used in the event of a fall, but not to aid upward progress. In contrast, aid climbing means the climber uses a variety of technical gear to painstakingly pull themselves up the cliff.Since climbing’s earliest days, climbers have squabbled over the intricacies of style related to that distinction. In 1911, noted German climber Paul Preuss published an essay in the German Alpine Journal in which he criticized leading climbers of the day for using pitons to pull themselves up sections of climbs they could not ascend with physical ability alone. “The piton is an emergency aid and not the basis of a system of mountaineering,” he wrote, sparking one of the community’s first grand debates over style.Throughout the first decades of the 20th century, the techniques and knowledge developed in early hotspots slowly traveled throughout North America, Europe, and elsewhere. This early era culminated in the 1930s, when many watershed technical climbs were done across Europe and North America, from the first ascent of Ship Rock in New Mexico and Devils Tower in Wyoming, to the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses in the French Alps.While most rock climbers were drawn to the biggest and most obvious challenges, a small subset of free climbers focused on mastering their athletic potential with smaller objectives.Bouldering, climbing without a rope on small cliffs and boulders where it is possible to land relatively safely, first evolved on the boulders of Fontainbleau outside of Paris in the mid-century. Because bouldering allows the climber to practice intricate movements unencumbered by a rope or safety concerns, it is the premier venue for pushing the absolute limits of free climbing.In the 1950 and 60s, an eccentric Air Force officer-cum-mathematician named John Gill living in Colorado Springs, Colorado, began to use basic gymnastics exercises and training principles to train for bouldering. He also used magnesium carbonate chalk favored by gymnasts to keep his hands from sweating while he climbed—both innovations that are universally embraced today.The immense granite walls of Yosemite Valley, California, became the most important climbing testing ground of the post-World War II era. In the late 1940s, Swiss immigrant and master blacksmith John Salathé began to experiment with a new breed of pitons made of extremely hard steel that could be hammered into the thin cracks of Yosemite and then removed for further use without buckling. Salathé’s new designs, along with a host of other inventions including mechanical ascenders and specialized hammocks that could be anchored to a sheer cliff face, sparked the golden age of Yosemite climbing, in which many of the area’s most iconic cliffs, including Half Dome and El Capitan, were first ascended using aid climbing techniques.For the first 70 years of technical climbing, the piton—a metal spike driven with a hammer into a crack in the rock— was the primary form of protection. In the 1972 edition of the Chouinard Equipment catalogue, Yvon Chouinard, Tom Frost, and Doug Robinson argued that the repetitive hammering of pitons into established climbing routes was destroying the resource. They advocated for the use of less invasive protection on both free and aid climbs—namely nuts and hexentrics, machined aluminum shapes that could be slotted into natural constrictions in cracks.Up until the 1970s, most free climbers felt it was cheating to hang on a rope to practice difficult moves over and over again, as one might do while bouldering. But during this influential decade, free climbers began to experiment with what was known at the time as hang-dogging—that is, rehearsing a sequence of difficult moves over and over again while resting on the rope between attempts in an effort to master the climb.In the late 1970s, climbers near France’s Verdon Gorge, a spectacular feature sometimes compared to the Grand Canyon, began rappelling down from the top of otherwise unscalable cliffs to explore and pre-equip routes with permanent bolts before attempting to free climb them from the bottom. In the early 1980s, in Smith Rocks, Oregon, a local named Alan Watts began developing climbs using similar “top-down” tactics.Hang-dogging and bolt-equipped climbs combined to create the discipline of sport climbing—climbing for the physical challenge of it on routes that have been engineered with in situ protection. In contrast, traditional climbing, a.k.a. “trad” climbing, refers to climbers who place and then remove their own protection as they go.Climbers use a highly technical system of grades to keep track of relative difficulty and rising standards in sport climbing, bouldering, trad climbing, and aid climbing.In North America, bouldering grades begin with a V- prefix and currently range from V0 – V16; sport and traditional (“trad”) climbing grades begin with a 5 prefix and currently range from 5.0 – 5.15, and each of these grades can be further measured by adding a, b, c, or d with d signifying greater difficulty; and aid climbing grades begin with an A- prefix and run from A0 – A5. Additionally, trad climbs sometimes carry a risk rating, PG, R, or X, to denote the seriousness of the fall potential.Going back at least as far as 1939, climbers occasionally found architectural facades suitable for practice—most notably at two universities, the University of Leeds in England and the University of Washington, where stone walls that were part of campus buildings began to serve as gathering spots for climbers. The first purpose-build indoor walls were introduced in the 1980s, and spread throughout Europe and North America by the mid-1990s. Climbing in these first-generation gyms was often a rough-hewn experience, with homemade walls and holds, dusty air due to poor air filtration systems, and the ubiquitous colored tape that was used to demarcate routes.More recently, commercial indoor walls have come of age thanks to a growing industry of wall and hold manufacturers, professional route-setters, and more.From informal local events to an international World Cup series, climbing gyms nurtured the growth of competitive climbing as a legitimate organized sport. Early events like the 1988 International Sport Climbing Competition, held on a 110-foot outdoor wall on the side of a lodge at Snowbird, Utah, helped pave the way for the internationally recognized IFSC World Cup series and climbing’s eventual inclusion in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.For climbing’s Olympic debut, competitors will compete in three disciplines: bouldering, lead sport climbing, and speed climbing, for one medal. In future Olympics, many athletes hope to see each discipline receive its own medal distinction.While competitive climbing represents how specialized climbing has become, the recent surge in big wall free climbing illustrates what’s possible by combining multiple disciplines.Lead by American Tommy Caldwell and German brothers Alex and Thomas Huber, Yosemite Valley experienced a second golden age in the early 2000s. By applying fitness and tactics gained from elite sport climbing to traditional aid climbing routes up El Capitan and other walls, Caldwell, the Hubers, and others established a new wave of 5.13 and 5.14 big wall free routes that inspired new generations of free climbers to think about attempting bigger objectives than the average sport climb.What’s most noteworthy is how quickly many of these lines have gone from test-piece challenges to seeing regular ascents. As Caldwell observes, “a lot of the new-school indoor climbing—with its big dynamic moves—actually translates pretty well to granite big walls, where the cruxes tend to be short stretches between holds or crack systems.”With approximately 450 commercial climbing gyms in the United States, and more opening up every month, climbing is uniquely posed among popular outdoor activities to find mainstream appeal. The sport’s recent growth has caused pressure on many popular outdoor areas, resulting in land-access issues that drive its more adventurous devotes to seek out new terrain.Much of climbing’s future lies in the vast areas of the globe that have not been systematically explored by first-ascenders.“You can’t just go out and discover another Mount Everest,” says climber and National Geographic explorer Mike Libecki, “but maybe some of the greatest bouldering fields or sport climbing crags or big walls are still out there. The mystery equals adventure.”",
"Hikers walk past towering rock formations in the Mustang region of Nepal.Upper Mustang in Nepal has seen a lot pass by its arid lands, from centuries of Tibetan Buddhist culture to piercing windstorms. But one thing it hasn’t seen a lot of is tourists. That is precisely, of course, the appeal of this remote, seldom visited corner of the Himalaya."The region has only been open to tourism since 1992, and still has an incredible air of mystery," says Hawker, who visited in 2012 as part of a team of runners racing the first trail race there. Now, the Mustang Mountain Trail Race is open to anyone with a good set of legs—and lungs. The eight-day stage race takes place in April with up to 40 runners, who trot about 124 miles of yak-worn footpaths.Though the climbs and altitude are enough to bust the biggest of lungs, the scenery is mercifully distracting. Runners pass lush barley fields, canyons, tiny stone farming villages, and monasteries festooned with prayer flags, all while contemplating the looming ever presence of snowy Himalayan giants like Annapurna and Dhaulagiri."It is a beautiful, open, wild landscape, an enclave of pure Tibetan Buddhist culture," Hawker says. "A very special experience in an incredible landscape."Plan This Trip: The Mustang Mountain Trail Race is open to all runners who wish to enter.Here are just a few of the things Lizzy Hawker has snagged in the world of endurance running: a women’s 24-hour road running world record for distance; a speed record for running between Everest Base Camp to Kathmandu; and five wins at the North Face Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc. In her spare time, she also got her Ph.D. in polar oceanography and ticked off seven first ascents on skis in Kyrgyzstan.",
"Location: Colorado  Established: June 29, 1906  Size: 52,074 acresAt Mesa Verde, Spanish for "green table," multistoried dwellings fill the cliff-rock alcoves that rise 2,000 feet above Montezuma Valley. Remarkably preserved, the cliff dwellings cluster in canyons that slice the mesa into narrow tablelands. Here, and on the mesa top, archaeologists have located more than 4,800 archaeological sites (including 600 cliff dwellings) dating from about A.D. 550 to 1300.The sites, from mesa-top pithouses and multistoried dwellings to cliffside villages, document the changes in the lives of a prehistoric people once dubbed the Anasazi. They are now more accurately called the ancestral Puebloans, and modern Pueblo tribes in the Southwest consider themselves descendants of these ancestral people. Some 40 pueblos and cliff dwellings are visible from park roads and overlooks; some of these are open to the public.Beginning about A.D. 750, the ancestral Puebloans grouped their mesa-top dwellings in pueblos, or villages. About 1200 they moved into recesses in the cliffs. So sheltered, these later villages seem to stand outside of time, aloof to the present.In 1888 two cowboys tracking stray cattle in a snowstorm stopped on the edge of a steep-walled canyon. Through the flakes they made out traces of walls and towers of a large cliff dwelling across the canyon. Novelist Willa Cather later described the scene: "The falling snowflakes sprinkling the piñons, gave it a special kind of solemnity. It was more like sculpture than anything else … preserved … like a fly in amber."Climbing down a makeshift ladder, the excited cowboys explored the honeycombed network of rooms that they named Cliff Palace. Inside, they found stone tools, pottery, and other artifacts in rooms that had been uninhabited for some 600 years.Why the Mesa Verde people eventually left their homes may never be known. Indeed, they lived in the cliff dwellings for only about the last 75 to 100 years of their occupation of Mesa Verde. Early archaeologists guessed warfare, and the evidence for this seems to concur. Archaeologists also think they may have been victims of their own success. Their productive dry farming allowed the Mesa Verde population to grow perhaps as high as 5,000. Gradually woodlands were cut, wild game hunted out, and soils depleted. Years of drought and poor crops may have been aggravated by village squabbles. By the end of the 13th century the ancestral Puebloans had left the plateau, never to return.Luminarias light Spruce Tree House, an ancient dwelling of the Anasazi people and the third largest cliff dwelling in Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park.From Cortez, take US 160 east for eight miles to the park entrance, then follow the winding park road 15 miles to Far View Visitor Center and 5.5 miles farther to Chapin Mesa Archaeological Museum and a cliff dwelling—Spruce Tree House.

Then go to the Chapin Mesa Archaeological Museum for an overview; and then visit nearby Spruce Tree House (no tickets required). From there drive the Cliff Palace Loop Road. In the afternoon, follow the Mesa Top Loop Road. Wear sturdy shoes and be prepared for some strenuous climbing if you plan to visit the cliff dwellings. Binoculars are useful for enhancing views across the canyon.With extra time, visit less crowded Wetherill Mesa.Mesa Verde National Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.

"Since the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) started keeping records in 1904, its mountain landscapes, seaside wildernesses, and high desert acres have registered more than 15 billion visits. Although global tourism plummeted as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns, 2021 saw record crowds at some of the best-known parks. Straddling the border between North Carolina and Tennessee, Great Smoky Mountains National Park passed 14 million recreation visits; more than 5 million people took in the stunning sandstone formations of Utah’s Zion National Park.Visitors are drawn to the vastness and variety of “America’s best idea.” From sea to shining sea (as well as in the wilds of Alaska and Hawaii), the NPS’s 85 million acres encompass 85,000 miles of rivers and streams; 7,035 square miles of reservoirs, lakes, or ocean; more than 43,000 miles of shoreline; and over 18,000 miles of trails.(Go wild, and skip the crowds, at these 7 spectacular parks.)These 10 parks are the superstars of the system, but they offer just a glimpse of the variety to be found in the 423 park units (including 63 national parks) of the NPS.“It’s wonderful to see so many Americans continuing to find solace and inspiration in these incredible places during the second year of the pandemic,” said Chuck Sams, director of NPS. “We’re happy to see so many visitors returning to iconic parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite, but there are hundreds more that should be on everyone’s bucket list. Whatever experience you’re looking for in 2022, national parks are here to discover.”",
"Towering granite monoliths like these and more await travelers to California's Yosemite National Park.Established: Federal protection (1864); National Park (1890)Size: 748,436 acresVisitor Centers: Yosemite Valley (year-round), Wawona and Big Oak Flats (May–October), Tuolumne Meadows (June or July–late September)Entrance Fees: $30 per vehicle. Reservations required during peak hours in peak season.“Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where Nature may heal and cheer and give strength to body and soul alike,” wrote John Muir in his beloved 1912 book The Yosemite. More than a century later, the giant California park still reaches those lofty goals via its dramatic landscapes, diverse outdoor pursuits, and the possibility of soul-searching reflection.Stretching nearly eight miles from east to west and with gran­ite walls more than twice the height of the Empire State Building, Yosem­ite Valley is one of the wonders of the natural world. Carved by glacial dynamics and weathering and erosion spanning 30 million years, few other places reflect in such remark­able fashion the geological forces that have shaped our planet.There is nothing quite as striking as viewing the valley for the first time while exiting the Wawona Tunnel, a view that stretches all the way to Half Dome and that impressed even the great Ansel Adams. For an even better view (and far fewer people to share it with), hike the 1.2­-mile trail to Inspiration Point from the tunnel’s upper parking lot.A circular one-way road system cruises past all of the valley’s major landmarks. The first of the many astonishing sights is the aptly named Bridalveil Fall, 620 feet of delicate white water tumbling down a granite face beneath Cathedral Rocks. Southside Drive soon runs along the Merced River, a slow-flowing scene for swimming, tubing, rafting, and fishing during the valley’s hot summer months. Cathedral Beach is a great place to get your feet wet or stare up at 3,593-foot El Capitan looming high above the valley. One of the holy grails of extreme adventure, the imposing cliff is on the bucket list of every serious rock climber. Bring binoculars to watch their slow but steady progression up El Cap.The road eventually leads into Yosemite Village, the valley’s human hub and home to the park’s main visitor center. In addition to a grocery store, gas station, post office, medical clinic, and other facilities, the village offers the Yosemite Museum of Native American culture, the Ansel Adams Gallery of photographic art, and the Yosemite Wilderness Center, where backpackers can obtain wilderness permits, bear canisters, and other backcountry essentials.Upon entering Yosemite Valley, most people stop along the road to admire 620-foot-high (190-meter-high) Bridalveil Fall. A steep trail leads to its base, where swirling winds often assure that visitors get wet from the spray. (Related: Photos of Yosemite National Park)Many of the landmarks scattered around the valley’s eastern end are best reached on foot or shuttle from Yosemite Village. Tumbling down an enormous rock face just west of the village, Yosemite Falls is impressive not so much in water volume but the sheer height from which it falls. Split into three sections, the cascade plunges 2,425 feet; it is the highest waterfall in North America and fifth on the planet. A super-easy trail leads to the falls’ rock-strewn base. Those with more time (and a lot more energy) can hike a 7.2-mile trail to the summit of Upper Yosemite Falls and its spectacular views across the valley.Other trails lead from the village to Ahwahnee Meadow, the best place on the valley floor to look at or photograph Half Dome no mat­ter what the season. Soaring 4,788 feet above the valley, the distinctive granite dome has been literally sheared in half by weathering, erosion, and earthquakes. Secreted in a stand of trees beyond the meadow is the Ahwahnee Hotel, which opened in 1927 and is now a national historic monument. Continuing eastward, the trails curve up Tenaya Canyon to legendary Mirror Lake, which reflects Half Dome and other monoliths.Perched along the south side of the Merced River are the Yosemite Conservation Heritage Center (interpretive programs, natural history exhibits, library) and Curry Village (formerly Half Dome Village) with its myriad food, beverage, and accommodation options. During the winter, the village ice rink hosts skating under the stars. The Happy Isles Art and Nature Center offers family-oriented, interactive nature displays and exhibits and art workshops.Happy Isles is also a jumping ­off spot for a branch of the John Muir Trail that leads up to Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall before leveling in Little Yosemite Valley and the high country beyond. A spur trail leads up the back side of Half Dome via a vertiginous cable walkway. Placing your chin on the outer lip of the dome and peering down almost a mile to the valley floor is an iconic Yosemite experience.The bulk of Yosemite National Park lies above the valley, a vast expanse of high-country meadows, mountains, and forest that includes the headwaters of several mighty rivers and more than 1,100 square miles of designated wilderness. Most of this region is accessible only by foot or horse. But two long, winding roads open up much of the Yosemite backcountry to motorists and casual hikers too.Tioga Road, one of the nation’s most scenic highways, literally splits the park in half between Crane Flat near the park’s western border to Tioga Pass at the crest of the High Sierra. Often closed until early or even midsummer due to snowpack, the road is the only drivable route between Yosemite Valley and the eastern side of the Sierra.Flanking Crane Flat are two of the park’s lesser-known wonders—the Tuolumne Grove and Merced Grove of giant sequoias, the only spots in Yosemite where you can occasionally have the redwoods to yourself, especially during the snowy winter months. Another “secret” spot is the forest and flower-­filled alpine wonderland around little Lukens Lake, 20 miles up the road from Crane Flat. Other turnoffs along Tioga Road provide parking for a few hiking trails leading to the north side of Yosemite Valley and vertigo­-inducing viewpoints like North Dome, Eagle Peak, Indian Arch, and El Capitan that perch 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the valley floor.Olmstead Point tenders one of the high country’s best views, a sweeping vista of Tenaya Lake and the flank of Half Dome in the hazy distance. Look out for marmots frol­icking on the rocky slope beside the parking lot. Largest of the park’s water bodies, Tenaya Lake is a great place to picnic or paddle—and perhaps even swim if you can stand the chilly water temperatures, even at the height of summer. A 2.5-­mile trail leads around the lake.With its visitor center, camp­ ground, tented lodge, and other services, Tuolumne Meadows is the “Times Square” of the high country. Trails meander across the giant meadow to Sunset Lakes, Soda Springs, Lembert Dome, and other natural landmarks. Both the Pacific Crest Trail and John Muir Trail transit the meadow. The wild and scenic Tuolumne River runs slow and gentle so close to its source in the High Sierra. Sunset is especially moody here, the soft pinks, purples, and golds of alpenglow coloring Mount Dana (13,057 feet) and other Sierra crest peaks. A free hiker’s shuttle connects Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley. Beyond the meadows, the road cuts through 9,945­-foot Tioga Pass and down the eastern slope of the Sierra to Mono Lake and the town of Lee Vining.The river eventually tumbles through the remote Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne (accessible only by hiking) down into deep Hetch Hetchy Canyon—an almost identical twin of Yosemite Valley until it was dammed and transformed into a lake in 1923 to provide water for San Francisco. Visitors can walk across the 430-foot­-high O’Shaughnessy Dam and gaze up the flooded canyon via Evergreen Road, which starts just outside the Big Oak Flat Entrance Station. Below the dam (and outside the park), the increasingly rugged river provides a venue for adventurous multi-day rafting trips through com­panies like OARS.Above the tunnel, Wawona Road climbs the valley wall into the park’s low­-key southwest corner. Roughly 7.6 miles beyond the tunnel is the turnoff to Glacier Point Road, which follows the southern edge of Yosemite Valley to “Wow!”-inspiring Glacier Point. From the point parking lot, the 8.7­-mile Pohono Trail leads across the top of the valley’s lofty wall to Sentinel Dome, Taft Point, and Dewey Point above Bridalveil Fall. Directly opposite El Capitan, Taft Point is a great place to watch climbers scaling the famed vertical face.About halfway along Glacier Point Road is the Badger Pass win­ter sports area, originally developed for Yosemite’s failed bid to host the 1932 Winter Olympics. In addition to family-oriented skiing and snow­boarding, Badger Pass also facilitates ranger-­led snowshoe tours and cross­-country skiing along the road (closed to vehicles in winter) to the Glacier Point Ski Hut (open December to March).Yosemite’s frontier side is on dis­play in Wawona Village, where the Yosemite History Center offers horse­-drawn carriage rides, a working blacksmith shop, covered wooden bridge, and other relics of the era before National Park status. The Wawona Hotel (briefly known as Big Trees Lodge) opened in 1876 to host early visitors to Yosemite. The lodge’s nine­-hole golf course (created in 1918) is one of the few found in the National Park System. The 3.5­-mile Wawona Meadow Trail loops through the mosaic of meadows and woods around the golf course.Among other Wawona activities are horseback trips through the sur­rounding woods and wandering the Mariposa Grove, the park’s largest stand of giant sequoias (more than 500 trees). The grove’s most celebrated tree is the Grizzly Giant, standing at 209 feet  tall and more than 1,800 years old (plus or minus a few centuries). A free shuttle runs between the grove and Wawona Visitor Center in the village. From the village, a 5­-mile trail leads to Chilnualna Falls, a beautiful series of five cascades that tumble 690 feet down a granite slope. The trail continues deep into the park’s southern backcountry and hardcore (read: expert-only) hiking to secluded spots like Chain of Lakes, the fin-shaped Clark Range, and the Fernandez Pass route into the Ansel Adams Wilderness.• Ahwahnee Hotel dining room: Breakfast, lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch beneath 34-foot-high (10.36 m) pine ceilings and granite pillars; Bracebridge “Old English” dinners during the Christmas season.• Yosemite Valley Lodge: Mountain Room Restaurant and Lounge, food court.• Curry Village: Meadow Grill, Pavilion Restaurant, Pizza Deck, coffee and ice cream bar.• Wawona Hotel Dining Room: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and Saturday barbecues.• Tuolumne Meadows Lodge Dining Tent: Serving breakfast and dinner.Hotels Lodging reservations: 888-413-8869 or travelyosemite.com • Ahwahnee Hotel: Historic park lodge in Yosemite Valley; pool, restaurant, bar.• Curry Village: Cabins, tent cabins, and Stoneman House rooms; pool, restaurant.• Wawona Hotel: Vintage 1876 wilderness retreat; pool, golf, restaurant.• Yosemite Lodge at the Falls: Motel-style accommodation in the village; pool, restaurant.• High Sierra Camps: Six remote tent-cabin camps along the John Muir Trail in eastern Yosemite accessible only by hiking; lodging price includes three daily meals.

"Alex Honnold climbs El Capitan without a rope or safety equipment, becoming the first person to free solo the route.YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, CALIFORNIA—Renowned rock climber Alex Honnold on Saturday became the first person to scale the iconic nearly 3,000-foot granite wall known as El Capitan without using ropes or other safety gear, completing what may be the greatest feat of pure rock climbing in the history of the sport.Rock climber Alex Honnold training on Freerider for the first ever rope-free climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. He completed the feat on Saturday, June 3, 2017. The historic event was documented for an upcoming National Geographic feature film and magazine story.He ascended the peak in 3 hours, 56 minutes, taking the final moderate pitch at a near run. At 9:28 a.m. PDT, under a blue sky and few wisps of cloud, he pulled his body over the rocky lip of summit and stood on a sandy ledge the size of a child’s bedroom.Honnold began his historic rope-less climb—a style known as “free soloing”—in the pink light of dawn at 5:32 a.m. He had spent the night in the customized van that serves as his mobile base camp, risen in the dark, dressed in his favorite red t-shirt and cutoff nylon pants, and eaten his standard breakfast of oats, flax, chia seeds, and blueberries, before driving to El Capitan Meadow.He parked the van and hiked up the boulder-strewn path to the base of the cliff. There, he pulled on a pair of sticky soled climbing shoes, fastened a small bag of chalk around his waist to keep his hands dry, found his first toehold, and began inching his way up toward climbing history.For more than a year, Honnold has been training for the climb at locations in the United States, China, Europe, and Morocco. A small circle of friends and fellow climbers who knew about the project had been sworn to secrecy.A team of filmmakers, led by Jimmy Chin, one of Honnold’s longtime climbing partners, and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, captured the ascent for an upcoming National Geographic Documentary Films feature. This past November, Honnold made his first attempt at the free solo, but backed off after less than an hour of climbing because conditions did not feel right.Honnold has been practicing for the daring climb for more than a year, training on routes throughout the Yosemite Valley and other locations around the globe.Read Alex's first interview about his epic climb.Trained in a climbing gym in Sacramento, Honnold, 31, burst onto the international scene in 2008 with two high-risk, rope-free ascents—the northwest face of Yosemite’s Half Dome and the Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion National Park. Those free solos astonished the climbing world and set new benchmarks in much the same way that Roger Bannister redefined distance running when he broke the four-minute mile in 1954.Rock climber Alex Honnold stands atop El Capitan after nearly four hours of climbing alone, without ropes or any other equipment or safety gear.“What Alex did on Moonlight Buttress defied everything that we are trained, and brought up and genetically engineered to think,” said Peter Mortimer, a climber who has made numerous films with Honnold. “It’s the most unnatural place for a human to be.”But those pioneering climbs pale in comparison to El Capitan. It’s hard to overstate the physical and mental difficulties of a free solo ascent of the peak, which is considered by many to be the epicenter of the rock climbing world. It is a vertical expanse stretching more than a half mile up—higher than the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. From the meadow at the foot of El Capitan, climbers on the peak’s upper reaches are practically invisible to the naked eye.“This is the ‘moon landing’ of free soloing,” said Tommy Caldwell, who made his own history in 2015 with his ascent of the Dawn Wall, El Capitan’s most difficult climb, on which he and his partner Kevin Jorgeson used ropes and other equipment only for safety, not to aid their progress.(What Caldwell and Jorgeson did is called free climbing, which means climbers use no gear to help them move up the mountain and are attached to ropes only to catch them if they fall. Free soloing is when a climber is alone and uses no ropes or any other equipment that aids or protects him as he climbs, leaving no margin of error.)Climbers have been speculating for years about a possible free solo of El Capitan, but there have only been two other people who have publicly said they seriously considered it. One was Michael Reardon, a free soloist who drowned in 2007 after being swept from a ledge below a sea cliff in Ireland. The other was Dean Potter, who died in a base jumping accident in Yosemite in 2015.John Bachar, the greatest free soloist of the 1970s, who died while climbing un-roped in 2009 at age 52, never considered it. When Bachar was in his prime, El Capitan had still never been free climbed. Peter Croft, 58, who completed the landmark free solo of the 1980s—Yosemite’s 1,000-foot Astroman—never seriously contemplated El Capitan, but he knew somebody would eventually do it.“It was always the obvious next step,” says Croft. “But after this, I really don’t see what’s next. This is the big classic jump.”By the end of 2014, Honnold had achieved international fame for his exploits. He had been featured on the covers of National Geographic, New York Times Magazine, Outside, and 60 Minutes had profiled him. He had a slew of corporate sponsors, had co-written a best-selling memoir, and started a nonprofit foundation to improve the lives of needy communities around the world. But he felt like he had not yet made the mark he hoped to on climbing history.In January 2015, when Caldwell and Jorgeson summited the Dawn Wall, a project they had spent years studying and training for, Honnold was there to meet them. Jorgeson told a reporter, “I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day.”What’s my Dawn Wall? Honnold asked himself. But he already knew the answer. For years he’d been thinking about what it would take to free solo El Capitan.The route Honnold chose to reach the top of El Capitan, known as Freerider, is one of the most prized big wall climbs in Yosemite. The route has 30 sections—or pitches—and is so difficult that even in the last few years, it was newsworthy when a climber was able to summit using ropes for safety.It is a zigzagging odyssey that traces several spidery networks of cracks and fissures, some gaping, others barely a knuckle wide. Along the way, Honnold squeezed his body into narrow chimneys, tiptoed across ledges the width of matchboxes, and in some places, dangled in the open air by his fingertips.Freerider tests nearly every aspect of a climber’s physical abilities—strength of fingers, forearms, toes, and abdomen, as well as flexibility and endurance. Environmental factors, like sun, wind, and the potential for sudden rainstorms, are also factors that Honnold had to carefully calculate.But the true test for Honnold was whether he could maintain his composure alone on a cliff face hundreds or thousands of feet up while executing intricate climbing sequences where positioning a foot slightly too low or high could mean the difference between life and death. Elite climbers have pointed to Honnold’s unique ability to remain calm and analytical in such dangerous situations, a skill that Honnold has slowly developed over the 20 years he has been climbing.Some of his poise can be attributed to his detailed preparation. He is obsessive about his training, which includes hour-long sessions every other day hanging by his fingertips and doing one- and two-armed pullups on a specially-made apparatus that he bolted into the doorway of his van. He also spends hours perfecting, rehearsing, and memorizing exact sequences of hand and foot placements for every key pitch. He is an inveterate note-taker, logging his workouts and evaluating his performance on every climb in a detailed journal.There are other climbers in Honnold’s league physically, but no one else has matched his mental ability to control fear. His tolerance for scary situations is so remarkable that neuroscientists have studied the parts of his brain related to fear to see how they might differ from the norm.Honnold sees it in more pragmatic terms. “With free-soloing, obviously I know that I’m in danger, but feeling fearful while I’m up there is not helping me in any way,” he said. “It’s only hindering my performance, so I just set it aside and leave it be.”On Freerider, one of the most daunting physical and mental challenges Honnold faced was two pitches of steep, undulating expanse of rock about 600 feet up. Polished smooth by glaciers over the millennia, the granite here offers no holds, forcing a climber to basically walk up it with his feet only. Honnold used a delicate technique called “smearing,” which involves pressing his rubber shoes against the rock to create just enough grip to support his weight on the incline. He had to keep his weight perfectly balanced and maintain enough forward momentum to avoid sliding off. “It’s like walking up glass,” Honnold said.Over Memorial Day weekend, Honnold made a practice run up Freerider with Caldwell. The pair reached the top in a little over five and half hours, breaking their own speed record in the process. “Alex was on fire,” said Caldwell. “I’ve never seen him climbing so well.”A few days before this week’s climb, Honnold hiked to the top of El Capitan and rappelled Freerider to make sure that a recent rainstorm had not washed off the marks he had made with dabs of chalk to highlight the route’s key holds. He found it dry and in perfect condition. Now all that was left was to rest and prepare mentally for the climb of his life.“Years ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free solo Freerider, there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like, ‘Oh that’s a scary move and that’s a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse,’” Honnold said. “There were so many little sections where I thought ‘Ughh—cringe.’ But in the years since, I’ve pushed my comfort zone and made it bigger and bigger until these objectives that seemed totally crazy eventually fell within the realm of the possible.”On Saturday, the possible finally became reality. After trusting his skill and endurance over hundreds of handholds and footholds and controlling his fear for just under four hours, Honnold pulled his body over the last ledges. Chin along with his assistant Sam Crossley and cameraman Cheyne Lempe had rappelled down with their cameras from the top to follow Honnold as he climbed the upper half of the wall, even using jumars—a type of mechanical winch—to hoist themselves up, the two had struggled to keep up with him.Chin, panting and covered in sweat, raced ahead to film Alex Honnold on top of the world.",
"All-year park. Avoid holiday weekends. Expect filled campgrounds from June through August and some crowding in late spring and early fall. Be sure you have reserved accommodations before attempting an overnight visit. You will find skiing and other winter activities in the Badger Pass Ski Area from about Thanksgiving to mid-April.Located in the Sierra Nevada range in California, Yosemite National Park is 195 miles east of San Francisco and 276 miles north of Los Angeles.From Merced (about 70 miles away): Follow Calif. 140 to the Arch Rock Entrance. Merced is one of the gateway communities for the Yosemite regional bus service (www.yarts.com or 877 989 2787). Also from the west: Take Calif. 120 to the Big Oak Flat Entrance.From the south, via Fresno: Calif. 41 takes you to the South Entrance. From the northeast, via Lee Vining: Follow Calif. 120 to the Tioga Pass Entrance (closed mid-November to late May, depending on weather).Trains stop at Merced; check with Amtrak about buses to Yosemite. Airports: Fresno and Merced.When a visitor asked a Yosemite ranger what he would do if he had only a day to visit the park, the ranger answered, "I'd weep." If you must zip through this huge park in a day, begin with Yosemite Valley.But even a dawn-to-dusk, one-day visit hardly allows enough time for more than a tour of the valley plus a look at one or two of the park's other major areas, such as the vistas from Glacier Point (road closed in winter beyond the ski area) and the sequoias of the Mariposa Grove.As an alternative take the High Sierra Tioga Road (closed in winter) to explore the park's alpine country. Better still, stay long enough to get beyond the crowds and discover the sense of seclusion this great park can give you along one of its trails.From luxury hotels to backcountry camps, Yosemite has lodging to fit everyone’s needs.The Majestic Yosemite Hotel is Yosemite’s landmark four-diamond hotel. Built in the 1920s near Royal Arches and Half Dome, the Majestic Yosemite's unique architecture features touches of art deco, Native American, Middle Eastern, and arts-and-crafts styles. It offers world-class cuisine, a variety of guest services, and a range of guest-room options.The Victorian-style Big Trees Lodge is a historic landmark that dates to the late 1800s. Set in a quiet part of the park near groves of giant sequoias, it is popular with families. Its 104 guest rooms are furnished with period pieces, and some share baths in the old-fashioned way. Big Trees Lodge has its own golf course, stables, and "swimming tank," and is near skiing and hiking trails, and other activities.Half Dome Village is Yosemite’s largest lodging property, consisting of nearly 500 cabin and tent dwellings in the heart of Yosemite Valley beneath Glacier Point. The prices are moderate, and the complex dishes up a variety of dining options, including a taqueria, a pizza deck and bar, and an ice cream stand.The High Sierra Camps, five groups of camps reachable only by hiking, offer a unique perspective on Yosemite. Visitors stay in canvas tent-cabins and must bring their own linens. Food and hot showers are offered.For details and more information on these lodgings, visit www.yosemitepark.com/Accommodations.aspx.Book your accommodations well in advance of your trip. Yosemite is one of the world's most-visited parks, and space for lodging and activities fills up fast.Yosemite has a trailhead quota system that requires visitors to have wilderness permits before venturing on overnight backpacking trips into the backcountry. No permit is needed for day hikers. It is recommended that visitors purchase their permits in advance. For more information, visit www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermits.htm.Be prepared. Bring water bottles or camelbacks, insect repellent, a first aid kit, sunscreen, and a camera. Dressing in layers and wearing rugged outdoor shoes is always a good idea.Remember that wildlife is wild. Do not try to touch the animals. Be cautious when eating and disposing of food. To avoid surprising larger mammals like bears, make plenty of noise on the trail; Yosemite has a very active black bear population. Please be aware of all food-storage policies and store food and toiletries properly. Any hiker planning to stay in the backcountry on an overnight trip is required to carry a bear canister, which can be rented at any wilderness office in Yosemite for a small deposit. Yosemite now offers wireless Internet access in most of its lodges and has numerous Internet kiosks.www.nps.gov/yose",
"Upon entering Yosemite Valley, most people stop along the road to admire 620-foot-high (190-meter-high) Bridalveil Fall. A steep trail leads to its base, where swirling winds often assure that visitors get wet from the spray.",
"The author sets out to hike the entire John Muir Trail after dark.Dusk. Lodgepole pines stand silhouetted against a darkening purple sky. The wind has died, and the forest is utterly still, as if time itself is holding its breath, waiting for night and not yet certain it will come. A faint ribbon of trail switchbacks up the mountainside between volcanic boulders and prickly manzanita until it fades from view. An unseen bird calls, the only sound at all besides the crunching of boots.  It’s midnight when I emerge from the forest atop a plateau beneath an infinite canopy of blackness and stars. The terrain ahead glows under the moon as if lit from within. Moving slowly, I cross a meadow and pass clusters of wizened mountain hemlocks. To the right something glimmers white, drawing me magnetically. Soon I stand transfixed by reflected moonlight that sweeps across an alpine lake to the base of a snowy massif. A light breeze drops to nothing, ripples in the lake go still, and the light coalesces into the single dot of the moon, the water around the reflection so placid that it reveals the pinpricks of stars.  This view at Island Pass in California’s High Sierra is sublime and rarely witnessed, too, though not for lack of hiker traffic. Every summer hundreds of people follow the route I’m hiking—the John Muir Trail (JMT), which runs for 211 glorious miles from the base of Half Dome in the Yosemite Valley to the top of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the lower 48. En route are a dozen major passes, alpine lakes photographed by Ansel Adams, and granite whipped skyward like the surface of a giant lemon meringue pie. The trail is well loved—too well loved, if you value unbroken solitude in the wilderness. But almost nobody sees Island Pass like this, when scenery that’s merely pretty during the day becomes downright magical at night.  I’ve made moonlit hikes before, out-and-back walks of only a few miles. Those jaunts were so memorable that I was inspired this past summer to tackle the entire JMT that way. My plan was to sync my movements to the rise and set of the moon, which would typically encompass late afternoon, dusk, and several hours of moonlit night.  This would be no expeditionary stunt, like unicycling to Everest. Night hiking, whether for 200 miles or just a couple, is something that many people are finding addictive. Hiking after hours, arguably more than any other way, would get me close to the wild heart of the Sierra—as John Muir himself experienced it.  Muir (1838-1914), hailed as an eco-hero and mountain messiah, was a bearded wanderer who spent years exploring the Sierra before coming down from the heights to successfully lobby for its protection. The first president of the Sierra Club, he worked to establish Yosemite as a national park and shaped the world’s view of what a protected wilderness could and should be.  Less well-known is that Muir wasn’t naturally inclined toward advocacy; friends had to prod him to assert himself publicly. But his ability to share his passion for wilderness was organic. In a typically rapturous passage from his book My First Summer in the Sierra, he praised the Sierra’s “domes and cañons, dark upsweeping forests, and glorious array of white peaks deep in the sky, every feature glowing, radiating beauty that pours into our flesh and bones like heat rays from fire.”  The Sierra still radiates beauty, but four million visitors now flood Yosemite every year—six times as many people as lived in the entire state of California when Muir first arrived in 1868. But most of them confine themselves to the relatively small Yosemite Valley. And the long swath of the range covered by the JMT—set aside in three national parks and four wilderness areas totaling over 3,000 square miles—is better protected from logging, grazing, and development than it was in the 19th century. As you hike the length of the trail, your feet touch a road only when you pass through Tuolumne Meadows.  What has changed over time are the people. Even JMT through hikers, a hardy lot going all 211 miles, are marshmallows compared to Muir. He didn’t have a GPS, an 800-fill down sleeping bag, or three-course dehydrated meals. Instead, he spent hundreds of days wandering alone, off trail, without a map, a stale loaf of bread strapped to his belt for nourishment and a pine thicket awaiting him for a bed. Some of his feats were extreme. He logged the first recorded ascent of icy Mount Ritter and once charged a bear just to see how it would react. He was no adrenaline junkie, though. He merely wanted to get as close as possible to nature, to take in its untamed essence through his every pore.  A Muir-like connection to nature is harder to establish in an era when JMT hikers can check work e-mails or play sudoku on their iPhones. Hiking at night promised to get me closer to the earlier, wilder spirit of Sierra exploration. There would be more unknowns and less control—but an enhanced sense of discovery. Like Muir, I wanted to not just see the mountains but to feel them.  IT'S 7 P.M., AND THE SUN is rising over Yosemite. My friend Tom Colligan and I have set out on the opening stretch of the JMT in late afternoon, scaling a mountainside so steep that, from our increasingly elevated perspective, it appears that the sun is climbing from the western horizon rather than sinking. But time runs backward only for so long, and as we head northeast, color drains from the sky until it is ashen, then black.  I’ve timed the three-week-long trek to maximize the light of the moon, which will grow larger and stay up later each night. Tonight, though, a fingernail crescent provides only a few hours of illumination before retiring below the horizon. Dense forest crowds the trail, leaving only a band of starry sky visible above. I can’t deny the obvious. It’s dark. Really dark.  Hiking at night isn’t as dangerous as it may sound, but it’s probably not well suited for novice hikers. Even if you’re experienced, plan on moving slowly—stumbling off the top of Half Dome or into a waterfall isn’t likely, but twisting an ankle or getting lost is if you’re careless.  I switch on my headlamp’s red light, which gently illuminates obstacles underfoot but doesn’t obliterate natural night vision. The minutes pass, and my latent superpower gradually kicks in: By starlight alone I can see. The formless darkness around the trail sharpens into looming columns of trees, each seemingly as thick as a Saturn V rocket. The stars become more numerous, variable, and bright to reveal the three-dimensional depths of the universe. The trail shows up as a pale stripe across the forest floor. “It feels like we’re just dreaming this,” Colligan says. “I think we’re both actually asleep in a ditch five miles back.”  The forest opens up to a grassy clearing. To the north a granite mountain arcs high into the Milky Way. The map lists Moraine Dome at 8,005 feet, but the mountain hulking before me is a larger, more mysterious presence than what any chart could convey. The vertical striations on the rocky face are vivid, while the forest below lurks in inky shadow. Muir appreciated how nighttime vistas such as this one were revealed artfully and selectively rather than with the bland equality of daylight.  “This evening, as usual, the glow of our camp-fire is working enchantment on everything within reach of its rays,” he wrote of a night in Yosemite. “Lying beneath the firs, it is glorious to see them dipping their spires in the starry sky...How can I close my eyes on so precious a night?”  After the openness of the clearing, the forest once again seems forbiddingly dark. But with vision imperfect, my other senses become hyperaware. A twig snaps somewhere off in the trees—too light to be a bear, probably a raccoon or deer. Next comes the fresh, green smell of water, followed minutes later by a trickling sound. A stream must be close. Make that a river, as the trickle becomes a gush. The gush grows into the roar of water blasting against rocks—a major waterfall. I’ve seen plenty of waterfalls but never fully heard one until now, the sound suggesting a fearsome, animate presence. Muir believed that what we think of as fixed in the natural world is in fact the mutable creation of our perceptions. Alter those perceptions by, say, hiking at night, and you can create a strange and wonderful new reality in your mind. “If the Creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us...” Muir wrote, “we should never doubt that we were in another world.”  A WEEK AND A HALF LATER, hiking alone now, I follow Evolution Creek as it flows through lodgepole pine forests and skirts pale green meadows. Waterfalls plummet from cliffs on either side of the valley. After several flat miles the trail climbs nearly a thousand feet in a series of dusty switchbacks, then levels out as it enters the Evolution Basin in Kings Canyon National Park.  The basin is one of the most spectacular—and popular—parts of the JMT. During the afternoon I saw at least a hundred hikers, which made the hallowed terrain feel less like wilderness than like Sierra Disneyland. Now, though, at sunset, the people are out of sight, huddled around camp stoves and soon to be snoring inside tents. I tingle with a selfish thought: Nobody else in the world will see what I will tonight. I have Disneyland all to myself!  Peaks flank the narrow hanging valley. Carved millennia ago by glaciers, the basin today shelters a string of glimmering alpine lakes on benches that stairstep to Muir Pass, at just under 12,000 feet. As the sun melts into the horizon, the valley is flooded with light as rich and thick as syrup. I freeze in place. Every pine needle is tinged orange. The pinnacles blaze with fire. Only a few minutes later the show of alpenglow ends, peace following drama. As Muir memorably wrote of this transition: “The daylight fades, the color spell is broken, and the forest breathes free.”  The sky deepens to midnight blue. Evolution Lake is so still as to appear frozen. The night’s dramatic lighting stimulates my perception and imagination: The twin pyramidal mountains rearing up behind the lake suddenly look like temples erected for extraterrestrial worship.  As the JMT climbs, a brilliant light spears over a mountaintop to the east, suggesting imminent moonrise. But the brightness turns out to be from the warm-up act, Jupiter. Half an hour later the moon itself appears, too giant, bright, and full to be viewed directly. The moon will be my companion on a long overnight hike, just as it once was for Muir. In My First Summer he recalls when “the full moon looked down over the cañon wall...as if she had left her place in the sky and had come down to gaze on me alone, like a person entering one’s bedroom.” To modern readers the passage might seem overwrought. But tonight I know exactly how he felt.  I climb into cratered, treeless terrain, with black, backlit peaks to the left, and gray, moonlit ones to the right. I hop from boulder to boulder over raging creeks, the moonlight-reflecting water the color of mercury in a thermometer. Nearing the pass, I lose the trail and clamber over rocks and stomp across crusty snowfields. Finally, at nearly 4 a.m., I crest the pass. The stars and planets are close overhead; a savagely beautiful and uninhabited world lies below. Triumphant, I feel less a hiker than an astronaut.  HIKING AT NIGHT wasn’t my idea originally. It was Dan Duriscoe’s. He’s a scientist with the National Park Service who several years ago led me on my maiden night voyage in Colorado’s Great Sand Dunes National Park. We scaled glow-in-the-dark mountains of sand. We hunted for constellations over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. And we admired our shadows on the dunes, cast by the light of Mars. That I could see so capably was a revelation, like discovering I had an extra hand. Duriscoe also gave me the gift of time—no longer would night always be wasted, not when the world’s most beautiful wildlands could be mine alone to explore.  Duriscoe lives in California, and in the waning days of my JMT trek, he meets me for a couple days of hiking. As we climb toward Mather Pass, he gestures west to a pointy summit. “That’s Observation Peak,” he says. “I once spent a whole night up there.”  On the peak, Duriscoe says, he experienced a “macroscopic” view of the universe. “I could see why rocks formed the way they formed, why plants grew the way they grew. I could see that the atmosphere was just a thin blanket, vital and life-enabling, wrapped around Earth.” He perceived that the universe was not a faraway abstraction but rather something that included our planet and him. No mere optical illusion, it was an existential revelation that would inspire his later scientific work.  Duriscoe is the co-founder of the park service’s Night Sky Team, devoted to protecting a natural resource that he believes is as vital and majestic as the geysers of Yellowstone or the forests of Shenandoah. Vital—and threatened. Analyzing sky darkness using photo mosaics and customized software, Duriscoe and his colleagues have identified where artificial light is blotting out our view of the heavens over national parks. They’ve also singled out the darkest, least disturbed night skies in America, such as over Big Bend National Park in Texas or Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. Stargazing has connected mankind to the universe for millennia, and Duriscoe hopes to keep it that way.  We reach the crest of Mather late in the afternoon and look south over an expansive landscape known as the Upper Basin. The view could just as well be that of the Tibetan Plateau. The Basin is high, barren, and beautiful, dotted with lonely lakes; flanking the broad valley are rocky summits still patched with snow even at the end of July. We will explore this enticing terrain overnight, but for now Duriscoe is ready for a refreshment break. “Let me see that whiskey,” he says, reaching for my flask. A couple of sips later, he unleashes a wilderness epiphany. “Women, career, none of it matters! They’ve just tied me down, kept me from being out here!” His words are barbed, but his face looks content. “I’ve wasted my life on bullshit!” he says happily and sets off downhill.  LIGHTS OUT AT 6 P.M. Beeping watch alarm at midnight. The last night of the trip has arrived, and with it comes the climax of the JMT—climbing 14,494-foot Mount Whitney. For the last few days I’ve been joined by a friend from home, Erik Stromberg, and we hit the trail before other campers have even completed their first REM cycles.  From our campsite at Guitar Lake, a billy goat trail etched into the mountainside snakes upward. The route is precipitous and exposed with the ground underfoot as dark as the sky, making the hike feel like we’re going through the stars rather than below them. We hike past the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia, wind through Sagittarius and Scorpio, and head down the Milky Way.  In the dead of night conversation subsides, and the mind is content to wander. I’ve been reading Muir in my tent and think about the contrast between his earlier, more emotionally plaintive work and the later material, which can be scientifically stiff. Want to learn about, say, Pinus lambertiana, the sugar pine? The bard of the Sierra will give you several pages on that. Though his contributions to natural history were undoubtedly important—especially the evidence he found for Yosemite Valley’s glacial origins—his older writing is perhaps even more valuable. It reminds us that nature is not just rocks, trees, and species but also something more holistic with unequaled power to stir your soul. The takeaway for my own after-hours quest is that wilderness is not a place you go but a feeling you seek—electric, aware, beyond yourself, alive.  The time slips by as we walk in meditative rhythm, and after a couple thousand feet of steady climbing, we reach a key junction. To the right, the path drops down the eastern slope of the Sierra all the way to the exit trailhead—to Stromberg’s car, a pancake breakfast, and the trip home. To the left, the route climbs another two miles to the summit of Mount Whitney, the official finish line of the JMT. We turn left, hiking just below a ridgeline that leads to the summit. We pass craggy pinnacles separated by couloirs that seem to slice down to the eastern desert floor, more than 11,000 feet below.  The horizon is brightening when we reach the summit, the stars fading. A jumbled procession of peaks marches northward under the purpling sky, and for a fleeting moment I experience Duriscoe’s macroscopic view of creation. I imagine that I’m seeing every step of the JMT, over mountains, around lakes, and through forests, leading all the way back in space and time to Yosemite.  The plan had been to wait for sunrise, but after 20 minutes, I no longer feel the need. “Sunrises are overrated,” I tell Stromberg, reaching for my pack. “Let’s head down.”",
"Yosemite National Park is about as big as the state of Rhode Island (both are roughly 1,200 square miles). Despite the park’s size, most people who visit make a beeline for one place, the Yosemite Valley, and confine their exploration to this mile-wide, 7-mile-long canyon cut by the Merced River.Sure, Yosemite Valley is more than worth visiting—and home to Yosemite icons such as Half Dome, El Capitan, and Bridalveil Fall. But if you leave after that, you’d be missing out on 99 percent of the park.Tioga Road—the stretch of California State Highway 120 that bisects Yosemite, running east-west just north of the valley—is open seasonally (depending on snowfall) and provides access to lesser-known, but equally rewarding, park landmarks.Originally a wagon road built for miners in the 1880s, this stunning high-elevation route ascends into an alpine wonderland of snowy peaks, pristine lakes and meadows, and towering trees.And though Yosemite’s high-country highlights involve a bit of hiking to see, most of them can be reached fairly easily, even by those with limited experience on the trail.Visitors intent on seeing the largest trees on Earth, which are found only on the Sierra Nevada’s western slope, tend to head for Mariposa Grove, near the park’s southern entrance. But this grove, one of three in Yosemite where giant sequoias can be found, is the subject of a long-term restoration project and will be closed until the spring of 2017.That makes Tuolumne Grove your best bet for getting up close and personal with these ancient redwoods.From the parking lot, a narrow road that was closed to vehicles in the 1990s slopes down through a thick forest. After about a mile’s walk, you’ll reach the grove, which includes a handful of towering sequoias, including a massive stump with a carved-out tunnel that you can walk through. Word of warning: It’s a bit of a steep trek out.Tip: The parking lot is located off Tioga Road, about a half mile east of its intersection with Big Oak Flat Road.A thrilling, single-lane section of what is now known as the “Old Tioga Road“—left behind when the Tioga Road was realigned to avoid Aspen Valley in the western part of the park—offers a tempting detour from Highway 120. It also provides relatively easy access to May Lake, a picnicker’s dream at Yosemite’s geographic center.This semi-steep trek to the lake is the perfect choice for those looking for a scenic hike, but who don’t want to spend the whole day on the trail. John Degrazio, a backcountry guide with YExplore, told me it’s “the biggest bang for your buck” in the park. And most people miss it.Is it merely a coincidence that the subalpine lake lies at the base of 10,855-foot Mount Hoffmann? Topographer Charles F. Hoffmann, a member of the team that surveyed the Sierra Nevadas in the mid-19th century, named the lake for a woman he was hoping to woo. She eventually became his wife.There’s no excuse to pass the trail leading to Olmsted Point—named for the architect Frederick Law Olmsted, of Central Park fame, and his son—without stopping.Just a quarter mile from the parking lot, a path snakes between junipers, rising up to a broad rock face dotted with enormous “erratics” (that is, boulders left behind by retreating glaciers). It’s fun and easy to scramble across what looks like a game board giants left behind.And then there’s the view. Olmsted Point looks out over Tenaya Canyon and Yosemite Valley in the distance, providing an unusual look at Half Dome. Look closely, or you might not recognize the famous peak.A couple of miles past Tenaya Lake lies a mound of rock that gives hikers of all skill levels the chance to “claim a dome.”Far less ambitious a climb than nearby Lembert Dome (or, somewhat obviously, the Valley’s Half Dome), Pothole Dome delivers significant scenic payoff in exchange for relatively little work.From the top, look east over Tuolumne Meadows, a landscape dominated by glaciated granite bedrock and sinkholes formed in the Ice Age, and at Cathedral Peak far beyond.In The Mountains of California, legendary naturalist John Muir offers a narrative, step-by-step guide to the Soda Springs that can still be followed today.As mountain peaks fall from view, Muir asks his readers to pay attention to details: ribbon-leaved grasses, Clark crows, creeping liverworts, mats of dwarf willow, and a ground “littered with fallen trunks.”Soon the path opens up into a wide meadow, where the brief hike’s reward can be found—a bubbling spring surrounded by a log enclosure.Robert Reid is National Geographic Travel’s Digital Nomad, exploring the world with passion and purpose.

"Fog lingers among the forested hills of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which spans the southern Appalachians along the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. Water and hydrocarbons exuded by trees produce the filmy "smoke" that gives the mountains their name.Established: 1934Size: 522,419 acresAnnual Visitors: 11.3 millionVisitor Centers: Oconaluftee, Sugarlands, Cades Cove, Clingmans Dome, GatlinburgEntrance Fees: Nonenps.gov/grsmBy the time Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited park in the United States, was established it was almost too late to save it.It was 1934; about 80 percent of the forest in the park had been decimated by logging. Much of the land belonged to 1,200 small property owners. It took the governments of Tennessee and North Carolina, donations from wealthy conservationists, the U.S. Park Service, and a whole lot of work to buy out the loggers and landowners, and to restore the Great Smoky Mountains to their glory.As the mountains regrew their 100 native tree species and over 100 native shrub species, the haze that gives the Smokies their name filled the mountain valleys in the early morning. The shaconage, as the Cherokee people call it, or “place of blue smoke,” is caused by moisture and organic compounds emitted by the dense vegetation, especially on still summer days.The Smokies are known for their incredible biodiversity; it’s said that moving from the lowest to highest elevations within the park is the biological equivalent of traveling from Georgia to Maine. More than 1,500 species of flowering plants, 240 types of birds, and around 50 kinds of fish live there.Great Smoky Mountain National Park has five visitor centers, ideal starting points for your journey. Here are our favorite points of departure for exploring the park.Hiking Mount LeConte could be the bucket-list item for the Smokies. LeConte Lodge sits close to the summit of Mount LeConte, at 6,360 feet the third highest peak in the park. There is no driving to the summit; hiking in is the only way to get there. Built on the site of a tent camp erected in around 1926 to house visiting dignitaries, LeConte Lodge hosts day trippers as well as overnight guests. Spectacular sunrises and uninterrupted nature at LeConte Lodge welcome hikers to the only National Park Service lodging in the park.Wears Valley, just outside the Tennessee side of the park, has pastoral views and its own lesser known park entrance. The other Tennessee park gates, especially the one in Gatlinburg, get congested at peak times of year. But the Wears Valley entrance just south of Townsend is where many locals enter the park.Synchronous fireflies light up late spring with their annual stupendous display of nature. At least 19 species of fireflies live in Great Smoky Mountains and the males and females of one species synchronize their bioluminescent flashing. Combined with all of the other fireflies that reach adulthood at the end of April/beginning of May, it’s a light display to rival Fourth of July fireworks. But plan ahead: A free lottery determines who gets to ride the shuttle into the park on certain dates to view the night lights.Quiet cemeteries may not be for everyone, but they’re certainly excellent places to relax. This national park contains more than 150 cemeteries from tiny plots with just a few headstones to hundreds. Not all of the burial places in the park are marked, but keep an eye out for periwinkle. According to local author Gail Palmer, European settlers planted periwinkle on graves to keep away evil spirits.North Carolina: Located just outside Cherokee, the Oconaluftee Visitor Center is the starting point for most visitors entering the park from North Carolina. In addition to a sizable bookstore and information desk, the center offers exhibits on Smoky Mountains history, in particular the Cherokee Indians and the early European settlers and their ancestors. Behind the visitor center, the Mountain Farm Museum gives insight into the lives of the people who once farmed the region, with hands-on exhibits and historic buildings brought from elsewhere in the park. Just up the road, the Mingus Mill is a relic of the days when corn was the region’s main crop and water-driven mills the mechanism for grinding it into flour and cornmeal.Beyond the mill, Highway 441 starts its forest-flanked climb into the heart of the mountains. The former site of the Smokemont lumber village renders the first opportunity for camping, hiking, and horseback riding through outfits like Smokemont Riding Stables. Trails in the Smokemont area lead to the historic Carver Cemetery and the Oconaluftee Baptist Church (built in 1896).The road continues its ascent to Newfound Gap on the Tennessee-North Carolina border (elevation 5,046 feet), where a viewpoint looks out over much of the Smokies. A stone monument marks the spot where FDR dedicated the park in 1940. There’s also a chance to hike a short portion of the Appalachian Trail, which leaps across the highway between the parking lot and monument. A side road leads to Clingmans Dome, at 6,643 feet the highest point in the park, third highest peak in the eastern United States, and the highest place along the entire length of the Appalachian Trail. From the observation tower, it’s sometimes possible to see to a distance of 100 miles. Although closed to motorized traffic in winter, Clingmans Dome Road is open for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or even walking through the ridge-line’s high-altitude spruce-fir forest.The North Carolina side features several off-the-beaten-track diversions where the quiet side of the Smokies is there for the taking. Once Cataloochee was one of the region’s largest settlements, a legendary apple-growing valley. Among the many 19th-century buildings that remain are two churches, the school, and several private homes. The lush valley also supports a herd of wild elk. Another journey into the past is the drive along Heintooga Ridge Road and the one-way continuation along gravel Balsam Mountain Road that leads into a remote section of the park that few people ever explore and is closed in winter.Tennessee: Gatlinburg and adjacent Pigeon Forge are the gateway to the park’s Tennessee sector, longtime holiday towns that offer a huge selection of accommodation, dining, and roadside attractions. Visitors can pick up information or find out what’s happening inside Great Smoky Mountains at the National Park Information Center in Gatlinburg or Sugarlands Visitor Center on Highway 441 just inside the park.The Sugarlands’ main attraction is a popular loop that includes Cherokee Orchard Road and the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail, a route that offers a microcosm of the park in terms of both natural attractions and what visitors can do. The path leads through old-growth forest to the Noah “Bud” Ogle Nature Trail (0.7 mile) onto a historic farmstead and the Rainbow Falls Trail (5.4 miles round trip) to a lovely cascade. The Roaring Fork portion is closed in winter.Little River Road runs east from Sugarlands to the Elkmont historic area and a large valley called Cades Cove that was another densely populated area prior to national park status. Motorists or bikers can pick up a self-guide tour book at the orientation shelter near the drive entrance and follow the 11-mile loop road to historic structures like the grist mill, three old churches, and bygone homes like Tipton Place. Cades Cove Trading Company rents bikes.Although most visitors treat Cades Cove as a dead end, intrepid drivers can follow two other routes out of the valley (although both are closed in winter). Rich Mountain Road is a one-way, eight-mile route over oak-studded terrain to Townsend and eventually back around to Pigeon Forge. Parson Branch Road heads in the other direction, a solitary one-way drive to Highway 129 at the park’s western extreme. From there, motorists can continue to Fontana Lake, which delineates much of the park’s southern boundary. At 480 feet, Fontana Dam is the tallest concrete dam east of the Rockies. The Tennessee Valley Authority maintains a visitor center beside the dam (open May to October), while Fontana Marina offers kayak, paddle-board, and pontoon boat rentals, as well as guided hikes and boat tours.Another quiet side of the park is the Greenbrier Cove, about a 20-minute drive from Gatlinburg via Highway 321. Porter’s Creek through the valley is well known for trout fishing. And the cove is the jumping-off point for several noteworthy hikes including the Brushy Mountain Trail (9.1 miles) to Mount LeConte.• LeConte Lodge: Perched at 6,400 feet (1,950.72 m) on the eponymous peak, this rustic accommodation is the highest guest lodge in the eastern United States and the only noncamping accommodation inside the park; it can be reached only by hiking. • Grove Park Inn: On the National Register of Historic Places, this Asheville institution opened in 1913 as the first big resort hotel in the Smoky Mountains region; restaurants, bars, spa, golf, tennis, history tours. • The Lodge at Buckberry Creek: Rustic design and fabulous views help this mountaintop B&B near Gatlinburg channel the national park lodges of old; kitchenettes, fireplaces. Camping• Ten developed campgrounds and five drive-in horse camps inside the park.• Blue Ridge Parkway: The nation’s longest linear park stretches 469 miles (754.78 km) between Great Smoky and Shenandoah national parks. The southern end is just 0.2 mile (.32 km) from Oconaluftee Visitor Center.• Biltmore Estate: Beyond its famous manse, the 8,000-acre (32.4-sq-km) private park features hiking, biking, horseback riding, river float trips, paddle-boarding, clay shooting, fly-fishing, Segway tours, carriage rides, and Land Rover off-road driving courses.• Pisgah National Forest: More than a half million acres (2,023.4 sq km) of the Appalachians in North Carolina fall within a national forest that boasts about 1,600 miles (2,574.95 km) of hiking paths and 245 miles (394.29 km) of mountain biking trails.• Trail of Tears National Historic Trail: Commemorates the Cherokee Indians who were forced from the Southeast and marched overland to Oklahoma in the 1830s. Several of the “round-up routes” start near the Smokies.• Manhattan Project National Historical Park: The Oak Ridge, Tennessee, unit of this multistate park includes the X-10 graphite reactor used to develop the first atom bombs.",
"Backcountry management specialist Christine Hoyer has spent the last seven years working at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.An outdoor enthusiast through and through, Christine is fortunate enough to have made her love of the outdoors into a career. When she’s not working in “America’s most visited national park,” Christine can be found hiking, backpacking, and photographing in her favorite place—the Great Smoky Mountains.Here’s a look at this diverse park through her unique lens.Follow Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Facebook and Twitter.When you try to figure out the best time to visit the park, the first thing you have to decide is what you hope to experience. The spring brings an abundance of mountain laurel, rhododendron, and other wildflowers. In the summer months the thick forest vegetation is lush and green. As the leaves turn, autumnal temperatures set the mountains ablaze in color and bring out the crowds. If solitude is what you are after, and the cold doesn’t give you pause, winter is the best time to visit the park.My park’s biggest attractions are the mountain views, but a visit isn’t complete without seeing one of the many waterfalls.If I could offer one practical tip for optimizing your visit, it would be to plan ahead. There is more to see and do in the Smokies than can be experienced in one trip, regardless of how long you have to spend in the park. Figure out ahead of time what you want to see—from the mountain views to the historic structures, the wildlife to the waterfalls. It will also go a long way to be familiar with the park regulations before you arrive. If you plan ahead you will not only make the most of your time in the park but you will also leave less of a trace of your visit for all those that come behind you.My favorite “park secret” is the night sky. Given its proximity to big cities and the areas of dense vegetation, some might not think of this as a place to enjoy the stars. In fact, there are some great places, both front country and backcountry, to experience the brilliance of the stars and/or enjoy the shadows cast by a full moon.Head to Cades Cove if you want to see wildlife. If you’re really lucky, you’ll spot a black bear, as well as deer, turkey, and other wildlife. If you are in search of the elk, a drive out to the meadows in Cataloochee is your best bet.For the best iconic view, head to Clingmans Dome. You can enjoy the view from the parking lot or walk up a half-mile, steep, paved trail to the top of Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the Smokies (6,643 feet). The view from the Clingmans Dome Tower is expansive and it is a great spot to catch the sunrise or sunset.With more than 800 miles of trails, most of which I have hiked at this point, it is challenging to pick a favorite! One of my favorite hikes in the park is to a place called Charlies Bunion. This is a popular spot but if you get on the trail early you may have this extraordinary rock outcropping to yourself. On a clear day you will be treated to a view of the mountains and valleys that stretch out in front of you. It is also a great place to catch a “smoky view” if you find yourself in or above the clouds.A drive to the middle of the park, Newfound Gap, from either Gatlinburg or Cherokee provides a scenic experience. You will have the opportunity to see views of the mountains that you are in at numerous overlooks. The park also provides a number of scenic loop drives that are well worth investigating.If you’re up for an adventure/physical challenge, take a hike to the Mt. Cammerer Fire Tower. There is more than one route that will take you to the top of Mt. Cammerer, the most common of which is 10.5 miles round trip. No matter which route you chose, you climb to just under 5,000 feet and travel along a beautiful stretch of the Appalachian Trail to get there. The 360-degree view from the Mt. Cammerer Fire Tower makes the trip well worth the effort.The Smokies is full of cultural history and each of the more than 100 historic structures left standing has a story to tell. They can be found from one side of the park to the other, from Oconaluftee to Cades Cove. To experience the park’s cultural side, explore the Elkmont Historic District which began as a logging town in the early 20th century. If you are willing to travel into the backcountry and off the beaten path you can also explore the remnants of the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) camps and the walls, trails, and structures they built in the park during the ’30s.There are plenty of places to stay outside the park but I would offer that the best places to stay while you’re visiting are within the park boundary. Depending on your experience and comfort level with camping, you might consider staying at one of the park campgrounds, backcountry campsites, or backcountry shelters. Bring a picnic as you will also find some great picnic areas to enjoy.If you only have one day to spend in the park, make sure to take a drive up to Newfound Gap, get out of your car, and take a short walk among the trees, and then enjoy a ranger program. (One day is never enough!)If you’re interested in a guided tour, I recommend taking advantage of the ranger-led programs. Our Interpretive Rangers lead hikes and provide a wide range of programs that focus on the history, the stories, and the resources of the park.The most peaceful place in the park has to be alongside a park waterway. There are more than 2,900 miles of rivers, streams, and creeks in the park, which provides plenty of opportunities to sit and listen to the natural soundtrack as the water flows.The park volunteers are the “unsung heroes” of my park because they are one of the things that make the Smokies such a great place. We are honored by the service of thousands of volunteers who perform a variety of duties—walk the trails, pick up litter, educate and assist visitors, protect the wildlife, etc. These volunteers provide the park with their time, energy, and talents as they assist staff in fulfilling the park’s mission.If you have kids (or are a kid at heart), you won’t want to miss the park nature trails. These are short loop trails (a mile or less), some of which have brochures that tell the story of the resources or the area the trail passes through. You can find most of these trails near the park campgrounds or other developed areas. They are great for family adventures!Just outside park boundaries, you can visit the Cherokee Indian Reservation and the Fontana Dam on the North Carolina side of the park or the art district and attraction-packed town of Gatlinburg in Tennessee.Some might think that the black bear should be the mascot of the Smokies, but I would offer that if my park had a mascot, it would be the salamander. The Smokies boasts at least 30 species of salamanders, one of which is only found here. Due to the abundance and diversity found in the Smokies it is often called the “Salamander Capital of the World”. These creatures find great hiding places and are quick, but once you know where to look you will find them. As predators they are also an important player in the park environment and they act as an indicator species for the health of the park’s complex ecosystem.The biggest threats to this park’s future are things we humans introduce. In my mind, this includes the invasive species that we bring in, as well as the impacts we create through air pollution and use of the resources. We can all do our part to minimize these threats by acting responsibly and respectfully as we engage with this special place.In 140 characters or less, the world should heart my park because of its diversity. The park contains ecological and cultural diversity that is unmatched and there is something here for everyone to discover.Before you visit (or when you arrive), make sure to check out these great resources (books, films, websites, apps, etc.): Official Great Smoky Mountain Park site; digital trip planner; Great Smoky Mountains Association site; and once you arrive in the park, stop by one of the Visitor Centers to get a copy of the seasonal Smokies Guide, which will provide information about the park, ranger-led programs, and other recommendations on things to see and do in the park.",
"Escape the park's notorious crowds on a four-day backpack that begins on the mellow Big Creek Trail in Great Smoky's northeast corner. Just 1.4 miles in, you'll hit the Midnight Hole, a paradisiacal plunge of dark blue-green water that demands a brisk swim. Dry off and proceed another four miles to Campsite 37. On day two, pick up the Gunter Fork Trail and start the steep six-mile hike up to Laurel Gap Shelter on the flanks of Balsam Mountain. Day three drops eight densely wooded miles to Campsite 39 by way of the Balsam Mountain and Palmer Creek Trails. On the final day, start early for the nine-mile hike out through Cataloochee Valley—you'll see reintroduced elk grazing in meadows as you pass by remnants of historic Appalachia like the Beech Grove School and Palmer Chapel. Climb out of the valley on the Big Fork Ridge Trail then the Hemphill Bald Trail. You'll end up at the Swag hotel, the ultimate place to drop your bag, grab a meal or a bed, and celebrate what you've just accomplished.All overnight hikes require backcountry permits; Campsite 37 and Laurel Gap Shelter require reservations (free; +1 865 436 1231). For car shuttle service, check with A Walk in the Woods (prices vary by trip; awalkinthewoods.com).The 5.5 miles to Mount Cammerer Lookout from Cosby Campground take in old-growth forests and one of the park's best views, ridgelines north into Tennessee.Haute rustic is an apt description of the Swag, a luxury inn at the edge of Great Smoky. Bearskins hang above a huge stone fireplace. Adirondack chairs are placed to maximize views. And the food is new southern. Example: crab and wild mushroom cheesecake (doubles from $490, including meals; theswag.com)",
"A nighttime view Clingman's Dome in Great Smokey Mountains National Park with the lights of Gatlinburg glowing in the distanceTiny Gatlinburg manages to pack a lot of touristy kitsch into its 10 square miles (26 squarer kilometers)—Ripley’s Believe It Or Not and mini-golf are mainstays—but its location at the edge of Great Smoky Mountains National Park can’t be beat: More than 521,000 acres (210,841 hectares) of peaks and forests covered with more than 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) of maintained trails are right out the door.PLAYWake up early to pedal the 11-mile (18-kilometer) Cades Cove Loop Road, a favorite of experienced cyclists, and watch the sunrise over the Smokies (www.nps.gov/grsm); Cades Cove Campground Store rents bicycles for $6 an hour (http://cadescovetrading.com/).

"The best day hikes have an element of quest, or mission, which is why so many of them climb to the top of a mountain or a landmark. Such is the case with many of the hikes presented below. But there’s no serious mountain trekking here—the point of each hike is the experience of getting there—and the inspiring view gained at the quest’s end.Can a single hike distill all the beauties of coastal Maine’s Acadia? This 5.4-miler comes close, offering a pleasant walk in the woods, a challenging ascent, and a glorious view from 1,373-foot Sargent Mountain, the second highest summit in the park. As an added bonus, the trail provides timely assists in the form of beautifully crafted stone steps and thoughtfully placed iron rungs.Start at the Jordan Pond House, follow the Spring Trail across the Jordan Cliffs Trail, and take the Sargent Mountain East Cliffs Trail to the summit. Once there, just turn slowly and start identifying.On a clear day Maine’s highest mountains, Baxter Peak and Katahdin, are visible far to the north. To the south are the Cranberry Isles, to the west Somes Sound, and to the east the granite domes of Pemetic and Cadillac Mountains.Worked up a sweat? Take a dip in Sargent Pond before returning via the Penobscot Mountain Trail.Few peaks anywhere are as beloved as Mount LeConte. People return to it year after year. LeConte lovers are slightly chagrined that it’s only the third highest peak (at 6,593 feet) in the Smokies, so they’re endeavoring to raise it—hence the growing pile of rocks at its summit.The 5.5-mile (one way) Alum Cave Trail is the shortest, steepest (2,600 feet of gain), and most interesting path to the top. It features more open ridges than other routes, so the views are greater—though always best in the haze-free shoulder seasons.Its wonders include two varieties of rhododendron (rosebay and Catawba), peregrine falcons doing aerobatics at Inspiration Point, and forest habitats that include old-growth hardwoods.The cable handholds along the ledge just below Cliff Top might seem unnecessary on a dry day, but when the rock is slick or icy, you’re grateful to have them.Alum Cave, at mile 2.3, is a great slate overhang and site of a Confederate saltpeter mine. The true summit is High Top, site of the huge cairn. But proceed to Myrtle Point for the Great Smoky view that draws visitors back to LeConte time and time again.In northwest Wyoming, the Specimen Ridge Trail off Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance Road rises 1,600 feet in 3.5 miles without relief, so only hiking gluttons begin this challenging hike, let alone reach the ridge top and the spectacular views it affords.When standing high on the ridge, the hordes at Old Faithful become a cloudy memory. After the trail passes through some grassy sagebrush meadows and clears a Douglas-fir forest, it emerges into vast open country that’s like a secluded grandstand overlooking the park’s northeast quadrant.To the north is Lamar Valley—wolf country. To the south, Mount Washburn (10,243 feet) rises over central Yellowstone. In between are expanses of meadows, and the foreground is special, too. The specimens in question are petrified stumps of oaks, redwood, birch, and maple trees as well as conifers—this is one of the world’s largest petrified forests. Late summer wildflowers round out the show.As the trail continues, the views magnify. The ridge summit, 9,614-foot Amethyst Mountain, is at mile 11 of the hike, and if you’ve arranged a car shuttle, you can proceed seven more miles down to the Lamar River Trailhead. Or just turn around anywhere, anytime. The view’s just as good going down.The aboveground scenery is just as compelling as the subterranean stuff at South Dakota’s Wind Cave National Park, and what a remarkable contrast.After their stygian stint, visitors emerge to encounter big skies, wide-open spaces, abundant wildlife, and a solitary, almost elegiac experience of a primal American—the prairies that once covered a third of the North American continent.This 7.3-mile loop starts on the Highland Creek Trail, which later intersects the Centennial Trail; the trailhead for the Centennial is the destination. The hike begins on mixed-grass prairie with distant views of the Black Hills and close-up views of a huge prairie dog colony.The trail then edges some lovely riparian stretches along Beaver Creek and Highland Creek and traverses ponderosa pine forests. Watch for bison wallows or, better yet, the beasts themselves—the park is home to hundreds of them. But beware: Their docile appearance is deceptive; they can charge at surprising speed. Elk, coyotes, deer, and pronghorn are also plentiful.Although 50,000 hikers a year summit Old Rag in Virginia, climbing to the 3,291-foot granite peak is no walk in the park. There’s nothing easy about it, but everything alluring.It’s what one local guide calls a “4WD hike,” meaning hikers should plan on employing every available limb and a good healthy ticker on the way up.The 8-mile loop climbs 2,380 feet to the summit on Yosemite-style granite slabs along the way. From the top, views can stretch 100 miles in any direction. The best trailhead is at Weakley Hollow.Old Rag can be hiked throughout the year, but locals call spring “Old Rag season” for two very good reasons: (1) sunshine and brilliantly clear blue skies, and (2) no snakes, bugs, or poison ivy to contend with.People come to Arizona to gape into the abyss of the Grand Canyon, to see the play of sunlight on rock, clouds on canyon, maybe to watch a rainstorm rush through, leaving a rainbow in its wake. To see the endless buttes and temples and side canyons and amphitheaters of rock.The best way to see it all, while avoiding the pounding of a canyon descent, is to hike the Rim Trail from Maricopa Point (where it becomes a dirt path) west to Hermits Rest—a distance of 6.7 miles. Take the park shuttle to the trailhead and pick it up at trail’s end, or at six other spots along the way.As the path undulates along the precipice, versus plummeting to the bottom, it reveals the park’s (maybe the world’s) most stunning panoramas–canyons within canyons, cauldrons of rapids far below. Do it late in the day and watch sunset do a supernova number on the scene, then hop the bus back to Grand Canyon Village. It isn’t perhaps the most challenging hike, but it just might be the most memorable.In Yosemite, counter to all reasonable expectations, the 13-mile valley trail that circumnavigates Yosemite Valley is lightly used—the park’s fabled crowds are in their cars or congregating at a few valley landmarks, leaving this gem wide open.The trail, an old bridle path, is unrelentingly spectacular as it winds in and out of forests, connecting most of the valley’s major sights. While the loop is 13 miles in its entirety, it does come with a bailout plan–it intersects park roads numerous times, so it is possible to shorten the loop and catch the park shuttle bus back to the starting trailhead.If starting behind Yosemite Lodge of Camp 4 and proceeding west, the trail hugs the base of mighty El Capitan with its 3,593-foot vertical wall until reaching Pohono Bridge, where it crosses over the Merced River to the south side of the valley.The trail then turns east and goes past Bridalveil Falls, crosses El Capitan Meadow, and parallels the Merced River until it reaches Swinging Bridge. Here the trail crosses back over the Merced, affording a great look at Upper Yosemite Falls, then winds back to the starting point at Yosemite Lodge.One of the greatest pleasures of Big Bend is its ability to deliver the unexpected. The Texas park’s 800,000 acres of desert expanse are compelling on their own, but when they yield to woodlands, uplands, or the presence of water, the result is startling and thrilling.All three can be encountered in Pine Canyon, especially in the rainy season, July to October. A high-clearance vehicle is recommended to reach the start of the hike, which begins in open Chihuahuan desert scrubland and climbs steadily into the canyon in the Chisos Mountains.Once inside, the trail winds through a cool, shady realm of ponderosa pine, oak, maple, and madrone. After about two miles, it dead-ends at a 200-foot cliff—a “pour-off” in the local parlance—that becomes a waterfall for several days after a rain. It’s truly a world within a world.Beautiful Cascade Canyon in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park is extremely popular with hikers, and Solitude Lake is the goal for many.Plenty of people set out to explore its depths—first on the shuttle boat across Jenny Lake, and then on the first few miles of the trail. But solitude and its eponymous lake lies at the end. From the boat landing, most hikers will make the steep climb to Inspiration Point for a signature view of the lake and the mountains that frame Jackson Hole, and perhaps proceed another 3.5 miles along Cascade Creek—prime bear and moose habitat—while towering pinnacles (the Grand, Mount Owen, Teewinot) loom overhead.But by the time a hiker reaches the point where the trail splits, with the North Fork Trail leading another three miles to Solitude Lake, the majority of the crowds will have disappeared. And intrepid hikers who reach Solitude get to behold the Grand Teton as no casual tourist ever does–a sheer 1,000 feet of dark, massive, towering rock. Just as moving are the collages of wildflowers—glacier lilies, mountains bluebells, and sticky geraniums—and the flashes of colorful western tanagers in the sky.The strenuous hike to Solitude Lake is 14.4 miles round trip from the boat landing. Hikers desiring a longer day hike can skip the boat shuttle and skirt the lake on the Jenny Lake Loop to reach the Cascade Canyon Trailhead, adding two miles each way.This article was excerpted from the National Geographic book The 10 Best of Everything: National Parks.",
"Zion National Park offers hiking, rock climbing, winter cross-country skiing trails, and beautiful vistas, including this one at Canyon Overlook.Established: Zion (1919)Size: Zion (146,597 acres)Annual visits: Zion (4.5 million)Visitor Centers: Zion CanyonEntrance Fee: $30 per vehiclenps.gov/zionZion National Park could be called a heaven on earth, a red-rock wonderland created by wind, water, and snow. Mormon pioneers arriving in the area in the 1860s were so overwhelmed by the natural beauty of Zion Canyon and its surroundings that they named it after the Old Testament name for the city of Jeruselem.The park’s ecosystems support about 800 native plant species, including more flowers than anywhere else in Utah. With more than 80 percent of the park designated wilderness area, it doesn’t take more than a few strides from a visitor center parking lot to pass into shimmering, absolute nature. But why take the well-trodden trail? Here are a few tips for how to experience the peace of the park during the crowded high season.Zion Canyon is epic, but the park is full of off-the-beaten path adventures and hidden gems, perfect for seeking out during the crowded summer high season. So pull over, wander off, and let chance be your guide. You don’t need a path for adventure; just 100 yards away from just about any road in Zion is likely to reveal a magnificent vista not on any map or in any book.Kolob Canyons may be smaller than Zion Canyon, some 40 miles to the south, but this wilderness delivers countless adventures in the form of empty hiking trails and 2,000-foot cliff walls with hardly anyone to hear their own echoes. While the park's waterfalls generally attract crowds on hot summer days Pine Creek waterfall remains under the radar; this small, but swimmable feature is an easy mile round-trip hike from an unmarked trailhead near the park's south entrance. But beware: the pleasant, creek-side hike can become suddenly dangerous if a flash flood strikes.The Watchman Trail is a popular hike in Zion, full of wildflowers and plenty of fellow hikers.The park revolves around Zion Canyon—15 miles long and almost 3,000 feet deep in places. It also includes much of the surrounding terrain, landscapes that range from desert to the high-altitude forests sprawling across the plateaus above the canyon.After making the transition from till to tourism over the past century, the old riverside town of Springdale is the park’s primary gateway. The main drag (Highway 9) is flanked by heaps of hotels, restaurants, art galleries, and shops, as well as outfitters that arrange adventure activities in and around the park. Choose between rock climbing and rappelling, helicopter and 4x4 tours, guided hikes along the Narrows, and tubing on the Virgin River downstream from the park. The Zion National Park Forever Project, the park’s official nonprofit partner, organizes a number of outdoor learning adventures, service projects, classes, lectures, and special events through its field institute, in addition to operating three stores inside the park.Pedestrian and vehicle bridges connect Springdale with the national park Visitor Center on the other side of the Virgin. In addition to exhibits and information, the visitor center is the southern terminus of the Zion National Park Shuttle, which is the only way to reach the heart of the canyon between spring and fall when visitation peaks. Private vehicles are not allowed beyond Canyon Junction, turnoff to the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway. Even if you’re not headed for south-central Utah, the highway makes an interesting detour through what was once the world’s longest auto tunnel to a geological oddity called Checkerboard Mesa, a sandstone facade scarred by hundreds of vertical and horizontal fissures.The first stop on the shuttle route is the Zion Human History Museum, which details the heritage of Native Americans and Mormon pioneers in the region. Entering the canyon, the shuttle makes seven stops, including viewpoints of celebrated stone formations such as Court of the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) and Weeping Rock, as well as historic Zion Lodge, a classic national park lodging designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and opened in 1927. The park’s most celebrated landmark—the Great White Throne, a 1,500-foot rock face—can be seen from numerous places along the canyon road.The road (and shuttle route) ends with a dramatic flourish inside the Temple of Sinawava, a colossal natural amphitheater. A riverside path continues to the Narrows, where the thousand-foot-high canyon walls are sometimes just 20 to 30 feet apart. Anyone is free to hike the Narrows as far as upstream Big Springs (beyond that you need a backcountry permit). But be prepared to get wet: much of the trail is through waist-high water.Zion Canyon is laced with other popular trails, from easy hikes including Emerald Pools (2.2 miles) to strenuous uphill slogs that lead to Angel’s Landing, Hidden Canyon, and Observation Point. Backpackers can trek the West Rim Trail (14.2 miles) across the wilderness Horse Pasture Plateau to Lava Point, where another trail connects to Kolob Canyons in the far north.Drivers can explore the high country via two motor routes that start outside the park. Kolob Terrace Road runs 22 miles from Virgin, Utah, to Lava Point and its scenic overlook. Exit 40 on Interstate 15 drops down to Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and the start of a road that leads 5.4 miles to a vista of the impressive red-rock gorges. High-country hikes are possible from both of the Kolob roads.• Pipe Springs National Monument: Historic frontier fort in a desert oasis setting near the Utah-Arizona border.• Capitol Reef National Park: A giant geological “wrinkle” called the Waterpocket Fold extends nearly 100 miles through this central Utah park.• Snow Canyon State Park: Cliffs and canyons, sand dunes, and lava formations are the allure of this reserve near St. George, Utah.• Fern and J. L. Crawford Lecture Series: Year-round monthly talks about different aspects of the Zion region feature historians, naturalists, curators, and authors. • Zion National Park Plein Air Art Invitational: Twenty-four prominent landscape artists descend on the park each November for painting, lectures, and art auctions.",
"A fast internet connection and doggedness won Trish Kenlon one of summer’s most cherished tickets: A pass to drive through the alpine scenery of Glacier National Park via the Going-to-the-Sun Road.Tickets to drive the road between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. are necessary, as the park staff juggles crowds amid construction delays and COVID-19 precautions. Obtaining the $2 tickets can be a challenge, as they’re sold through Recreation.gov, the government-backed outdoor recreation reservation site often overwhelmed by demand.At the last minute, Kenlon was able to snag two nights’ lodging at Lake McDonald Lodge; the room came with a coveted Sun Road ticket.Being savvy—and speedy—is key for crowd-shunning national park visitors this summer. Many corners of the National Park System already are jammed. Recently, Utah’s Arches National Park had reached capacity and closed its gate to visitors before 9 a.m. Yellowstone National Park counted a May-record 483,159 visitors, while next-door neighbor Grand Teton National Park notched 363,712, also a record. During the Memorial Day weekend, some determined to stand atop Angels Landing in Zion National Park waited four hours in line for the privilege.Rather than endure such crowds or waits, a friend and I kayaked into the watery backcountry of Lake Powell in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah. We spent our days on the water and our nights under brilliant, star-choked skies in remote side canyon campsites. Heading north from Bullfrog Marina, we explored the four closest side canyons: Moqui, Forgotten, Hansen Creek, and Crystal Spring, and some of the fingers that spurred off of them.(The 10 least-visited U.S. national parks will surprise you.)You needn’t break a sweat paddling or hefting a backpack to commune with nature without the cacophony of cellphone conversations or having to elbow your way to see Old Faithful erupt. As more and more folks head out in search of nature, you do need to be strategic and expand the possible destinations. Here are some great options for avoiding crowds. But know that even these destinations will grow in popularity. If you can, schedule your adventures outside of the summer months and visit mid-week.The secret of this spectacular park, with its 65-mile-long bay and ice rivers, is out. But because there are few hotel rooms in the 3.3-million-acre park and nearby Gustavus, those lucky enough to grab one will have all that natural beauty mostly to themselves. “Even with all the structural capacity full, it is not that crowded,” says superintendent Philip Hooge. “There’s just not that much tourist infrastructure here. Go out here kayaking and you’re not going to see crowds like you do down south [the U.S. mainland parks].”Jumping-off point: Gustavus, Alaska. Explore the bay, its birds, marine life, and glaciers on a day trip aboard the concessionaire’s ship. Kayakers can also hitch a ride aboard the ship for deeper explorations in the park and schedule a pickup later.Rocky Mountain National Park, in eastern Colorado, is operating on a reservation system again this year, and much of its backcountry is closed as the park recovers from last year’s devastating wildfires. But 30,750-acre Black Canyon, farther west in the state, has yet to see 500,000 visitors in a year. The state’s least-visited national park offers adventure, striking geology, and no-fuss encounters with nature. Head to the North Rim with its seven-mile-long dirt road, which discourages more than a few visitors, and you’ll drive into solitude and beauty. Those who land one of the park's 13 campsites ($16) can pitch their tent among the pinyons and junipers overlooking views of the nearly 3,000-foot-deep canyon from Exclamation Point or Chasm View.(Here is the ultimate hot springs road trip in Colorado.)Jumping-off point: Montrose, Colorado. Peer into the canyon at various times of day, as the sun highlights the facets the Gunnison River began to carve through volcanic rock two million years ago. The Deadhorse Trail, beginning at the Kneeling Camel overlook, is a five-mile (roundtrip) hike that park staff describe as easy to moderate. More experienced/adventurous hikers can trek further into the wilderness, with its stands of pinyon pine, Douglas fir, and juniper, along with some outbreaks of gambel oak.From 1607 to 1608 Captain John Smith explored the Chesapeake Bay, “searching every inlet and bay fit for harbors and habitations…” Today you can trace his wanderings by canoe, kayak, or sailboat.The national historic trail offers 3,000 shoreline miles to explore.  Along the way, charming communities share the region’s 17th century Native American history, the role of African American “watermen” involved with shellfishing and boat building, as well as Captain Smith’s legacy.Jumping-off points: Numerous. Call the park to find out when Werowocomoco, a 58-acre site the National Park Service acquired in 2016, opens to visitors. It’s believed that Captain Smith met Powhatan and his daughter, Pocahontas, here in December 1607, according to this park page.True, this northwoods park saw a 40 percent increase in 2020 visitation compared to 2019, but still, that was only 263,091 visitors for the entire year. Visitors are widely dispersed across 218,000 acres, with some cruising Voyageurs by houseboat, others by kayak or canoe, and still more on foot.“The team at Voyageurs has done a great job of siting out campsites in a manner that really gives campers a sense that there are few if any other campers in the vicinity,” said superintendent Bob DeGross. “I often hear that we have the best campsites in the National Park System.”A number of backcountry campsites can only be reached by canoe or rowboats, which you can rent at the park. Reserve a site at Loiten Lake for arguably the most solitude, though know you’ll need to take a boat ferry across Kabetogama Lake and then hike about a mile to where you can launch your canoe.Jumping-off point: International Falls, Minnesota. Want to enjoy the watery side of the park but fall asleep in more comfortable accommodations? Reserve a room at the remote Kettle Falls Hotel on the Kabetogama Peninsula. Fifteen miles from the nearest road, you’ll need a boat or floatplane to get there.Crowds? Not here. So far, the busiest year in terms of visitation was 2017, and even then fewer than 170,000 people explored this park of ancient bristlecone pines and dark caves. Although a construction project is keeping the Wheeler Peak Campground at 9,886 feet closed this summer, there are five other front-country campgrounds and plenty of backcountry to find a place to pitch your tent or hang your hammock. Just one of the three usual cave tours is being offered this year, the Parachute Shield Tour, but there are more than 60 miles of backcountry trails to meander.(U.S. Route 50 is the loneliest road in America.)Jumping-off point: Baker, Nevada. Look in the Great Basin Visitor Center for the Winchester rifle that dates to 1873. Its owner for reasons unknown left it in the backcountry of the present-day park, where it was found in 2014 by researchers. Well-weathered and blending in almost perfectly with a juniper, the rifle was restored at the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody. Though the rifle didn’t have a cartridge in its chamber, there was one stored in its stock.Avoid summer’s high heat with an early fall visit (when fishing starts to pick up) to this wild seashore on the Outer Banks. Unlike its northern neighbor, Cape Hatteras National Seashore, Cape Lookout shuns infrastructure; there are no towns or paved roads on its three barrier islands. Experienced kayakers can navigate Back Sound, Core Sound, and Onslow Bay and pitch their tents among the dunes. Surfcasters can reserve a rustic cabin and fish day and night without crossing lines.Jumping-off point: Harkers Island, North Carolina. Although the seashore’s lighthouse is closed for structural repairs, visit Shackleford Banks for a glimpse of the more than a hundred horses that roam here. Travel to historic, 18th-century Portsmouth Village (from Ocracoke at Cape Hatteras) to see where cargo from sea-going ships was transferred to coastal villages in South and North Carolina; or comb the beaches for sand dollars and seashells.Yosemite and Sequoia are crowd magnets in California, while Lassen is generally overlooked. The main attraction is the trail to the summit of Lassen Peak, but it’s not the only wonder. Within park boundaries you can find four types of volcanoes: plug dome, shield, composite, and cinder.Head to the eastern side of the park for real solitude. Pitch your tent or park your RV at one of the campgrounds or land a room in the Drakesbad Guest Ranch and spend your days on the trail, fishing, or checking off the different types of volcano. When you’re ready to leave, follow the Volcanic Legacy Highway north to Lava Beds National Monument and Crater Lake National Park.Jumping-off point: Mineral, California. Take the trail through the Devastated Area to see the impact of the pyroclastic flow that jetted down the slopes of Lassen Peak in May 1915 and raced through this area. Don’t overlook Bumpass Hell, a geothermal area that looks as if it was moved here from Yellowstone National Park.Kurt Repanshek is the founder and editor-in-chief of NationalParksTraveler.org, a nonprofit media organization that covers national parks and protected areas.",
"The sun rises on Garden Wall, a rock spine shaped by Ice Age glaciers, in Glacier National Park.“Crown of the Continent” is an apt nickname for this pair of parks, which feature some of the most impressive mountain scenery in North America. Joined together since 1932 as the world’s first international peace park, Glacier National Park in Montana and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta offer a contiguous high-country wonderland of rock, ice, water, and wood.Glacier, a beloved park in northwestern Montana, takes its name from the many glaciers and glacial forces that shaped its rugged topography over two million years. While the park is still home to more than a dozen glaciers, even more impressive are the massive U-shaped valleys and hulking granite peaks carved by long-ago ice flows.Nobody leaves the park without driving at least a section of Going-to-the-Sun Road. Constructed during the Great Depression by Civilian Conservation Corps workers, the 50-mile route could easily double as a a rollercoaster ride up and over the Continental Divide. Whether you start from Lake McDonald in the west or Lake St. Mary in the east, your hands will surely be sweaty by the time you finish.Among the many landmarks along Going-to-the-Sun Road are Avalanche Creek with its ancient hemlock-cedar forest, a wicked switchback called the Loop, a roadside Weeping Wall, and the overlook for big Jackson Glacier. The Continental Divide splits the road at the 6,646-foot-high Logan Pass, where a visitor center and bookstore provide shelter from the chilly highland weather.Mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and marmots inhabit the rocky slopes around Logan Pass, which is also a hub for several great hikes, including the family-friendly Animal Super Heroes Trail and the 1.5-mile nature trail to Hidden Lake. The western end of Lake St. Mary, where trails lead to three splendid waterfalls, is another great place to hike.Apgar Village anchors the western end of the road with its lakeside hotels, restaurants, shops, and visitor center. During summer, scenic cruises run along Lake McDonald; kayaks, canoes, rowboats, and paddleboats are also available for rent. Camas Road heads north from the village to lakeshore access at Rocky Point and a bridge over the North Fork Flathead River that provides a great perch for snapping scenic shots of the front range. A rough gravel road continues into the park’s rarely visited North Fork Area and super-secluded camping spots beside Kintla Lake and Bowman Lake.Highway 2 loops around the south end of Glacier, flitting in and out between the park and two national forests (Flathead and Lewis and Clark). About halfway along is Goat Lick Overlook, where you can gaze across the valley at a lofty railroad trellis and possibly spot Rocky Mountain goats clinging to the cliffs.Glacier’s east side is bounded by the Blackfeet Nation and reservation towns like East Glacier that cater to park visitors. Just outside East Glacier is a spectacular but lesser-known part of the park: Two Medicine, where the Blackfeet once undertook sacred rites of passage. Trails meander around three lakes and along a creek to Running Eagle Falls, which gushes through a giant stone orifice.St. Mary lies at the eastern end of Going-to-the-Sun Road. In addition to a lodge, cabins, and several eateries, the hamlet offers another national park visitor center. Just beyond the park entrance, a large grassy area, Two Dog Flats, is a great place to look for bear or elk. Ninety-minute boat tours of St. Mary Lake depart from a floating dock at Rising Sun Campground.Another elongated valley, Many Glaciers, tenders some of the park’s most popular hikes, including a 5.5-mile trail to the base of Grinnell Glacier, a strenuous climb up to Swiftcurrent Pass (6.6 miles), and a relatively easy jaunt to Ptarmigan Falls (2.5 miles). Scenic boat tours of Swiftcurrent Lake and Lake Josephine include a quarter-mile hike between the two. Kayaks, canoes, and rowboats are available for rent.Two private companies run motorized tours inside the park. The legendary Red Bus Tours operates in vintage, oak-framed vehicles from the 1930s, and the Blackfeet-owned and operated Sun Tours interprets the park from an authentic Native American perspective.Visitors should always be aware that Glacier is bear country—bruins of both the black and grizzly variety. Bear spray is essential, even on short walks. As one Glacier ranger explains, “A grizzly doesn’t care if you’re walking 10 yards or 10 miles.”The national park is mostly shuttered in winter. But nearby Whitefish, Montana, is a hub of cold weather sports with a ski and snowboard resort ranked in the U.S. top 10 by Ski Magazine. It also plays host to a wide range of other winter fun.",
"Montana’s Glacier National Park is where everything bright and strong and never tamed comes together on high: gray wolves and great silver-tipped bears, storms that hit the Great Divide like tsunamis with golden eagles surfing the wind waves, twisted trees 200 years old but scarcely tall enough to hide a bighorn sheep, and impatient wildflowers shoving through snow to unfurl their colors.Some 762 lakes, dozens of glaciers, and innumerable waterfalls glisten in forested valleys. But perhaps best of all, a scenic highway and more than 700 miles of trails criss-cross the park, making much of its beauty accessible to visitors.Geographer Richard Menicke arrived at Glacier in 1992, and quickly carved out a niche for himself as the park’s foremost geographic information system (GIS) specialist, working to improve natural resource management and educate the public about Glacier’s ecological significance. Here is his insider’s guide to this “Crown of the Continent” jewel.September is the best time to visit Glacier because the crowds are gone and the park is beautiful. You can feel like you have the place to yourself.Glacier’s biggest attraction is Going-to-the-Sun Road and Logan Pass, but a visit isn’t complete without seeing the Two Medicine region or Many Glacier on the east side of the park.If I could offer one practical tip for optimizing your visit, it would be to pass through the entrance gate before 9 a.m. and generally get an early start to each day. Avoid crowds by giving yourself lots of time to go big or simply relax and enjoy—whichever you prefer.My favorite “park secret” is amazing backcountry settings that are reached quickly by foot during a day outing.Head to Many Glacier if you want to see wildlife. If you’re really lucky, you’ll spot a grizzly bear. But be warned: Make sure to enjoy the local fauna at a distance and do not approach the animals.For the best view, head to Swiftcurrent Lookout. The apex of a stout hike with significant elevation gain in the center of the park, this fire lookout station allows visitors to see just about everywhere.The Highline Loop or Grinnell Glacier trail are the best trails in the park and the Chief Mountain Highway—which connects Glacier to Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada—is the most scenic drive. The two parks together make up the world’s first International Peace Park, a partnership that was forged in 1932.If you’re up for a physical challenge, try hiking the Gunsight Pass/Sperry Chalet to Lake McDonald trail (20 miles!) or from the Highline Loop up and over Swiftcurrent Pass to Many Glacier (13 miles). Both of these hikes are point-to-point treks that require a shuttle or coordination among friends hiking the same trail from the opposite direction.To experience the park’s cultural side, hike up to Sperry Chalet or Granite Park Chalet. You can also sit at the foot of Two Medicine and appreciate the value of that valley to the Blackfeet people over time.Any front-country, drive-in campground is the best place to stay while you’re visiting.If you only have one day to spend in the park, make sure to take Going-to-the-Sun Road (start before 8 a.m.) to Logan Pass. Cross from west to east, or vice versa, to see the dramatic change in the landscape.If you’re interested in a guided experience, try a ranger-led tour or seek out one of the park’s permitted partners.The most peaceful place in the park has to be the North Fork, where you really feel “out there.”The Lundgren family is an “unsung hero” of my park because during their many years of operating private visitor facilities in Apgar campground and neighboring West Glacier community, they kept the look and feel of the area rustic and in character of the larger Glacier experience.Witnessing a snowfall and a grizzly bear—all in one day, in August—could only happen in my park.If you have kids (or are a kid at heart), you won’t want to miss sledding at Logan Pass in July or swimming in Lake McDonald.Just outside park boundaries you can visit the 2.4 million-acre Flathead National Forest, which includes the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Dog owners, take note: You can hike the trails with your pooch(es).If my park had a mascot it would be the mountain goat.The biggest threat to this park’s future is crowded conditions that can adversely affect visitors’ experience.In 140 characters or less, the world should heart my park because it’s wild, historic, magical, stunningly beautiful, and globally relevant as part of the world’s first International Peace Park.",
"Clouds settle between the mountains behind Waterton Lake and the Prince of Wales Hotel.Location: Alberta Date Established: 1895 Size: 124,788 acresThe deepest lake in the Canadian Rockies (444 feet, 135 meters) and the first oil well in western Canada (1902) are both found in Waterton, a small park named in honor of English naturalist Charles Waterton. Set where Alberta's prairies meet the Rocky Mountains, Waterton has special significance as the Canadian portion of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.Border Park: Waterton sits in the extreme southwestern corner of Alberta, sharing boundaries with British Columbia and Montana in the United States. It’s “where the mountains meet the prairies,” as locals like to say. Indeed, lush native grassland rolls right up to the colorful peaks, which have been carved from sedimentary rock well over a billion years old.Picture-Perfect: With its outstanding scenery, sunny weather, easygoing wildlife, and picturesque tree-lined coasts, Waterton is a photographer’s paradise. The park’s isolation, far from any urban center and off the beaten track, keeps the crowds small.Hikes and Bikes: All three of the Waterton Lakes lie along the entry road. Other paved routes provide quick access to park highlights. One of the hiking trails is world famous, while mountain bikers will find several trails open to them, too.The closest international airport is located at Calgary, 158 miles (254 kilometers) away. From Calgary, take Highway 2 to Fort Macleod (102 miles, 164 kilometers), then turn west along Highway 3 for 60 miles (97 kilometers) to Pincher Creek, where Highway 6 runs southward for 31 very scenic miles (50 kilometers) to the park gate. Highway 5 continues another 5 miles (8 kilometers) to the “townsite” of Waterton Park, as Parks Canada describes the in-park community, summer population about 2,500. From east or west, take Highway 3 to Pincher Creek.From the United States, you can enter the park directly. Take Mont. 17 north to the Chief Mountain border crossing and continue into Alberta on Highway 6. Be sure to inquire in advance of your visit for the Canadian post’s hours of operation and seasonal closures.Canada is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2017 and, to celebrate, it's offering everyone free admission to its national parks. Waterton is open year-round, but windy weather discourages visitors in winter. Few services are available in the park between October and May, when some roads are subject to closure and the townsite population drops to fewer than 40.Spring arrives in early May. The park is busiest in July and August, when daytime temperatures reach over 70ºF (21ºC) and may hit the mid-90sºF (around 32ºC).Low-elevation wildflowers are at their best in June, while the high country above tree line is most colorful in mid-July. Waterton’s many aspen groves paint the valley floors and lower slopes brilliantly yellow in September.You’ll want a full day to tour the park’s three byways, so get an early start. Morning light on the mountain front is a spectacle best appreciated from the Waterton Valley viewpoint along the Chief Mountain Highway (Highway 6) in the eastern part of the park.Return to the townsite for brunch and enjoy a breezy stroll along the shore of Upper Waterton Lake. The M.V. International and other passenger vessels cruise the lake. Since the waves may get bigger as the day goes by, morning is a good time to take the two-hour-plus cruise boat ride down the lake and back.Then head up scenic Red Rock Parkway to Red Rock Canyon. The canyon is aptly named, very photogenic, and great fun for the kids.End your day by taking the Akamina Parkway to Cameron Lake to see stately peaks resplendent in the afternoon sun. The lake offers a smashing view to craggy peaks at the far end, just across the international boundary, plus rare botanical delights along the shoreline.",
"I stood ankle-deep in the mountain lake, icy inch-high ripples raced over my naked, chicken skin legs.On the pebbled shore, a fat man in a swimsuit leaned on a pair of crutches, pulling his jumpy German Shepherd on a leash and critiquing my painfully slow descent into the water.“Just jump in, dude!” he shouted at me, as if he knew me.This is something I’ve begun to notice in national parks—the sudden familiarity among strangers, all of us humans hanging out in nature, some more obnoxious than others.The fat man kept yelling at me, “What are you waiting for? JUMP in!”I tried not to get annoyed.“I’m waiting for the sun!” I shouted back to shore, shivering in the wind. When the sun is up and the sky is clear, Glacier National Park can soar up into the eighties—it can get so warm that all you want to do is jump into a clear and frigid glacier lake.But now the sun was clenched behind a thick set of blinding clouds, darkening the mountainside with premature night. The wind ripped across the lake and suddenly, I wanted a parka over my bathing suit.Before noon, I had seen a bunch of kids splashing in the water—they seemed so happy and the water seemed so clear, I vowed to come back and swim—after my hike.But my hike took six hours—three miles takes longer when you’re climbing three thousand feet up. The whole time I was huffing it uphill, I wasn’t sure if the trail led to some scenic point or if the highest point was actually known as “Scenic Point” (it is).I’ve always wondered who decides these things—how does something become generally-accepted as “scenic” by the broader public? On maps, one road will be outlined in green, with a legend informing me that this part of the world has been deemed “scenic”, but does that automatically render the blank white parts of the map as non-scenic?Everything is scenic, if you think about it—because merely looking at something transforms it into a scene. At Glacier National Park, some scenes involve floating mountains and glassy lakes, while others involve long lines at the gift shop, a lot of nonplussed mule deer and the occasional grizzly bear.I never saw any bears but I did see all the signs telling me that they were there. Climbing Scenic Point, the sign read something like, “If you’re not carrying bear spray than it’s really stupid because you could get eaten like some people have.”I had remembered sun block and bug spray and a reserve camera battery and a hat and sunglasses and water and a waterproof layer—but I had forgotten my bear spray.Thus I found myself alone in the woods with bears and no bear spray, which has never really bothered me before, but that sign—that sign with big red letters—turned my scene from just a guy hiking to a hiker being hunted with scary music building in the background.“This scene does not end well,” I thought, and so I waited on the path until a pair of chatty hikers turned the corner.“Do you have any bear spray?” I asked, without even introducing myself.“Yeah,” they shrugged, as if it was obvious.“Do you mind if I tag along behind you?” I inquired, crashing their couple’s getaway for the afternoon.They said they didn’t mind, so I followed behind until they branched off onto a lesser trail, leaving me to the upper trail and any lurking bears. For the rest of the afternoon, I hopped from one group of hikers to the next, like a frog among lily pads, figuring that as long as I was with others and chatting lots, the bears would stay away.And stay away they did—although I saw their prints in the dirt—big claw prints in the soft grey sand. At the top of Scenic Point, I searched for the big brown beasts, but only saw a pair of big horn sheep, clinging to the cliffs a thousand feet above Two Medicine Lake.An hour and a half later, I was standing on the shores of Two Medicine Lake, vacillating like a chipmunk on the road—to jump in or to get out?Two Medicine is sacred to the Blackfeet Indians native to Glacier National Park. According to the common lore that gets passed around national parks, Two Medicine was a spot where the Blackfeet underwent their individual vision quests—a time of contemplation, solitude and spiritual searching to discover one’s purpose and destiny in life.Perhaps this is the real meaning of “scenic”—a place where the nature is so powerful, you start seeing and feeling beyond your senses—transcendental. But my final plunge into Two Medicine Lake was not as transcendental as I had hoped. It was merely cold. And brief.For five minutes, I was alone in the cold water, surrounded by magic mountains and a sky that was closing in on me, so I left—dried off and drove on to St. Mary where the next day I met other tourists like me, all of us happy and overwhelmed by the gargantuan topography, all of us out in nature, on our own respective vision quests.In a café I met an older couple, married 53 years, who had met as college students working summers at Glacier National Park. I met a waitress with purple hair from Missoula, and a Chinese family with sprightly young kids who spoke no English beyond “Mountain! Big!”, and an elementary school music teacher on summer vacation, who rode his motorcycle from Boston to Montana in just five days.I followed behind his motorcycle on the must-see, can’t-miss-it, iconic, memorable, Going-To-The-Sun Road. This is the Old Faithful of Glacier National Park—a parade of obedient vehicles that moves slowly upwards until the road goes up no more. This is the scenic route, and if such things can ever be compared, one might even suggest that it is the most scenic road of all—in the park, in Montana, in the world? This is a beautiful and scenic drive, and thousands of people know it, which is why when I drove it, it felt more like a scenic traffic jam.Right the top of the Going-To-The-Sun Road is a scenic parking lot and when I finally arrived, it was full of cars, like a Saturday morning at Target. I cruised up and down the lot, losing three spots to inconsiderate drivers before finally sliding into a vacant spot three seconds after a truck had pulled out.“Yesterday, I broke up two fights,” one park ranger told me, when I asked him if visitors ever got antsy up here. The two of us were standing at the edge of the parking lot, gazing out across the immense glacial valley, with a single sunbeam poking through the clouds and lighting up the side of Going-To-The-Sun Mountain.“Fistfights?” I asked, and he nodded yes. People punching people over a parking spot in the most scenic parking lot on Earth—imagine!“I’m sorry I missed that,” I told him, guessing which lens and shutter speed I would need to capture a face plant on the Continental Divide in overcast conditions.Instead I was shooting the whole of nature with my camera—my widest-angle lens aimed at the widest span of natural grandeur. Big, Rocky Mountain clouds cast shadows across the valley, and I simply stood there and watched—for an hour.For an hour, my world stood still, as the clouds moved and the rest of the world swarmed around me, all of them coming and going on their vision quest, some shorter than others. Teenagers complained to their parents about the cold, biker gangs revved their engines, and another ranger asked if she could borrow a pen to write a few parking tickets.“Come back the first week of September,” said the first ranger. “It’s still summer and all these people are gone—you’ll have the whole valley to yourself.”I’m sure he’s right, and that standing alone on Logan Pass is some kind of magnificent, but I didn’t mind all the people because I was one of those people, too. I was a stranger from far away who had traveled to Montana on a vision quest of my own. I was one of those cars that I now watched moving up the scenic base of the mountain like a parade of prostrate pilgrims, creeping higher and higher, into the clouds, onwards and upwards, all of us, going . . . to the sun.",
"Have you ever considered quitting your job and hitting the trail for something like, say, 3,100 miles? Sounds like a pretty extreme backpacking trip, huh? My coworker, Peter Sustr, just left Outdoor Industry Association to tackle the Continental Divide Trail, a fabled route that follows the spine of the United States from Canada to Mexico.Perhaps you remember Peter from when I wrote about his fast and light trip through Grand Gulch last year. He’s always had an affinity for trekking through the woods alone, but this brings it to an entirely new level. This epic journey will span six months, take him to the lofty height of 14,270 feet atop Colorado’s Grays Peak, and pass through five states, 25 national forests, 21 wilderness areas, three national parks, one national monument, and eight BLM resource areas. It should be quite an adventure. In fact, it’s on National Geographic Adventure’s Ultimate Adventure Bucket List.What an amazing National Outdoor Recreation System we have in this country that you can embark on such a long journey through some of the most wild and scenic areas in the United States. This Continental Divide Trail system is a labor of love by passionate citizens who are dedicated to completing and protecting this national gem. Learn how you can help by checking out the Continental Divide Trail Coalition.Just a couple dozen people embark on the full Continental Divide Trail each year. The route—which is only about 70 percent complete—requires some careful way finding as you pick your way along many sections that are unmarked and unnamed. It’s definitely not for the faint of heart. From the scarcity of water in New Mexico, to the dizzying peaks of Colorado, Wyoming’s vast isolation, and the daunting grizzly country of Montana, each state brings its own challenges and rewards.Vertically traversing this giant country promises to wear through Peter’s shoes, deliver a physical beating, leave his hips begging for a soft bed, and ultimately transform his perspective—whether he’s ready for it or not.Such is the beauty of thru-hiking. (Yes, those in the know spell it like that, even if it gives grammar geeks like me a severe twitch.) You’re bound to spend a lot of time alone, reflecting on life and how insignificant modern-day worries seem. To immerse in the raw beauty of natural landscapes day after day—with little distraction—promises to profoundly connect Peter with nature and cleanse his soul in a way only the wilds can.Will he make it? Peter thinks that mental will is the ticket to success. Of course it will be tough. Some days he’ll want to curse or cry or bail. But he firmly believes that if he sets an intention, he can complete this challenge—as long as he is able to adapt to the unexpected.Is he nervous? Of course! You’d have to be missing a chip to not have a little trepidation. But he’s learned to live with challenges before. And he’ll be fueled knowing that his journey is helping raise awareness for a cause near to his heart. Peter suffers from Crohn’s disease, an intestinal ailment, and he’s partnering with the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America to demonstrate how you can still live a full life with this disease. The motivation to prove his point will be the stoke that keeps his fire burning through bad weather, getting lost, broken gear, physical pain, loneliness, or whatever other curve balls come his way.This is Peter’s dream. And he’s doing it. Good for him! How many people sit around day after day, chained to a job they don’t like, or hindered by the perception that there are too many obstacles to pursuing what makes their heart sing? Nonsense! You only get one crack at life. Start crafting it into what you want it to be. You might not be able to take off into the woods for six months, but I’m willing to bet you can take one small step toward making your dreams reality. And guess what? If you keep taking small steps, before you know it, you’ll be living the life of your dreams. What are you going to do about it today?Want to follow Peter’s journey?

"The centerpiece of this approximately 265-mile road trip is Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, the first park of its kind in the world. Created in 1932, the park spans the United States-Canada border and includes Montana’s Glacier National Park and Alberta’s Waterton Lakes National Park. In Glacier, travel the legendary Going-to-the-Sun Road over the Continental Divide. Take a ranger-led tour to learn how climate change is impacting the park’s namesake glaciers, and see the rapidly retreating masses of snow and ice before they disappear. Outside the park, dine in mom-and-pop cafes in Kalispell and Whitefish, and raft or fish the area’s wild waters. Close each day with an authentic Montana experience such as chowing down on a chuck wagon supper or sleeping in a restored railroad car.Kalispell > U.S. 93 > Whitefish > MT-40 > U.S. 2E > Glacier Route 1/Going-to-the-Sun Road > St. Mary > U.S. 89 toward Babb > Many Glacier Road to Many Glacier > backtrack on Many Glacier Road to U.S. 89 and back to St. Mary > MT-49 > 2 Medicine Road to Two Medicine Lake > backtrack to MT-49 > East Glacier > U.S. 2W > MT-206 > MT-35 > Kalispell.Note: Portions of roads may be closed due to snow or ice; always check road conditions before taking this road trip.Glacier Park International AirportInside Tip: Though there is a transportation system available from July 1 to September 7 in Glacier National Park, rent a car to be able to cover this entire road trip.Glacier National Park is called the Crown of the Continent, and it certainly lives up to the regal billing. The park, which requires an entrance fee of $25 per car in summer, covers 1,583 square miles, straddling the Continental Divide. The most scenic part of this road trip is Going-to-the-Sun Road, a winding route through the heart of the park, including 6,646-foot Logan Pass. Start the drive by stopping at the Apgar Visitor Center at the west entrance. Ask about what to do, road conditions, and special ranger-led programs. Inside Tip: Consider a trip to Glacier National Park in the early fall, when the gaggle of tourists are mostly gone and the larches are turning gold and dropping their needles. Note: Going-to-the-Sun Road is scheduled to partially close for the winter on September 21, 2015, cutting off the eastern side of this road trip route.Start in Kalispell, a city of about 20,000 people with a small-town feel. Spend time visiting local cultural attractions, including the Hockaday Museum of Art and the Conrad Mansion, which gives tours every hour (closed Mondays).For photographers, the best way to ensure you'll capture images of Montana's wildlife is a visit to Triple "D" Game Farm. Here you can see and photograph wolves, grizzly bears, red foxes, bobcats, and mountain lions, among other animals.Check out Lone Pine State Park for dramatic overlooks of Kalispell, the Flathead River and Flathead Lake, and the Swan Mountain range.Featuring some 700 miles of trails ranging from easy to very challenging, Glacier National Park is heaven for hikers. Choose a route that matches your fitness ability and interests. For alpine views and possible wildlife sightings, follow the Highline Trail. The Iceberg Lake Trail is an intermediate route named for its payoff view: a teal-blue lake that holds small icebergs throughout most of the summer. Another visitor favorite is the Avalanche Lake Trail, a fairly easy hike that winds through old-growth cedar-hemlock trees that make up what's considered Glacier's rain forest. Inside Tip: Although the water in the park is very clear, the park service does not recommend that you drink water straight out of the source. Bring a water filter. Also, take along bear spray just to be safe.To get the most out of a trip to Glacier, consider hiring a guide to the park's outdoor wonders. Glacier Guides and Montana Raft Company in West Glacier has a 12-room lodge and offers hiking, biking, backpacking, rafting, and fishing day trips. Glacier Raft Company in West Glacier is the only company in Montana that has a permit to raft and fish in the Great Bear Wilderness. The Glacier Institute offers the “story behind the scenery” through on-demand Personalized Educational Outings with a private guide and transportation to park destinations like Logan Pass, Avalanche Lake, Grinnell Glacier, Firebrand Pass, and Huckleberry Fire Lookout.In Whitefish, State of Mind Fishing Charters and Stumptown Anglers guide trips to catch fish like lake trout (mackinaw) and native westslope cutthroat trout. Inside Tip: Try to visit during the “golden three weeks” in spring (usually June) when the snowmelt runoff makes the water muddy; the fish are hungry but don’t get spooked because they can’t see the anglers above.Two must-sees on this road trip, both on the eastern side of the park, are Many Glacier, where you can view how ancient glaciers shaped the landscape, and Two Medicine, which has become an off-the-beaten-path option for most visitors. Each area offers hiking, boat tours and rentals, road tours with concessionaires, and campgrounds.The Whitefish area offers lodgings both grand and simple. On the grand side is the Lodge at Whitefish Lake, with its massive façade facing the lake and docks. The much smaller Good Medicine Lodge is a cedar-log building with a Western motif inspired by Native American beliefs and practices. For “Montana-sized” breakfasts (try the huckleberry buttermilk pancakes or chorizo quiche) and wooded views, stay at Hidden Moose Lodge. Designed to celebrate the state’s rugged Big Sky spirit, the rustic, yet luxurious, log lodge features a number of Montana-made elements including a 20-foot-high river rock fireplace in the vaulted Great Room.‪The Kalispell Grand Hotel‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ is more like a big bed-and-breakfast than a grand city hotel. The continental breakfast menu includes home-baked chocolate-raspberry or chocolate-apricot friendship bread, sour cream coffee cake, and potato, egg, and cheese quiche.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬West Glacier is the gateway to the park. Before exploring it, spend a night at the Belton Chalet, the first chalet built for Glacier National Park (in 1910, the same year the park was created). Inside Tip: If you're traveling as a family, reserve the Adobe House, the newest addition to the property, which features authentic Mexican bricks, a wraparound porch, a fire pit, and more.Two companies dominate lodgings in and near the park. Glacier National Park Lodges/Xanterra Parks and Resorts operates such properties as the Village Inn at Apgar, where all the rooms have lake views; hundred-year-old  Lake McDonald Lodge; and Many Glacier Hotel, which celebrates its centennial in 2015 but which will be partially closed for renovation in 2016 before fully reopening in 2017. Glacier Park, Inc. is the other major player in the park, featuring lodgings such as Apgar Village Lodge, West Glacier Motel, Motel Lake McDonald, Glacier Park Lodge, and St. Mary Lodge.Once you travel Going-to-the-Sun Road, you find yourself on the eastern side of Glacier National Park with several lodging options available. If you continue on Hwy 2 around the southern edge of the park, you'll find the Izaak Walton Inn in Essex. The decor celebrates the inn's railroad heritage, with nine real locomotives and train cars retrofitted to sleep visitors.The most entertaining dining experience in Kalispell is the Western Barbecue Dinner Ride at Artemis Acres Paint Horse Guest Ranch. Guests ride in a chuck wagon or go on horseback to an alpine meadow in the wilderness, where they dine on flat iron steak, chicken, salmon, and strong cowboy coffee cooked in a big pot from a chuck wagon. Meals are cooked on a 19-foot-long homemade grill, including a part welded from 180 horseshoes. Inside Tip: BYOB for dinner.Another Kalispell favorite is Norm's News Soda Fountain and Candy Shop, an old-fashioned soda fountain serving burgers and ice-cream treats such as handmade malts and sodas. It also has over 800 different varieties of candy treats and over a thousand magazine titles.Chow down in Whitefish at the mom-and-pop Amazing Crêpes and Catering; the Tupelo Grille, which specializes in Cajun and southern cuisine, fresh seafood, steaks, and pasta; Loula’s, located in a historic Masonic Temple that turns a hundred years old in 2015; Latitude 48, a bistro serving seasonal Mediterranean fare; and the ornate Whitefish Lake Restaurant, located at the Whitefish Lake Golf Club.On the western end of the park, try the Base Camp Café in Columbia Falls, serving hearty, fill-up-for-a-hike breakfasts and lunches, or Belton Chalet in West Glacier for some Belton Signature Popcorn (featuring Rouge Creamery gorgonzola, candied bacon, and beer-glazed nuts) in the taproom or Montana Meatloaf (bison meatloaf wrapped in hickory-smoked bacon) in the dining room.St. Mary is a village at the east end of the Going-to-the-Sun Road. After the drive, stop at Johnson’s of St. Mary, which serves family-style breakfasts, lunches, and dinners in a rustic atmosphere; the Park Café, which specializes in great pies (visitors are invited to come experience the “power of pie”); and the Snowgoose Grill, featuring an appetizer of grilled Montana-raised elk sausage, which is served with Tillamook sharp cheddar and a mixed-berry preserve.East Glacier is the nexus of activity on the eastern side of the park. Luna’s is in a log cabin built in the sixties and serves big portions for hungry hikers; a visitor favorite is the huckleberry pie (the chef makes about 1,400 in a five-month season, sometimes 22 per day). Brownie’s Hostel and Bakery, Montana’s only Hostelling International member hostel, is a bakery and deli serving fresh cinnamon rolls and home-baked bread.In Essex, have an evening meal at the Dining Car at the Izaak Walton Inn. Menu items include lamb lollipops with a watercress pesto, and mango chili–glazed sockeye salmon with wild rice and quinoa pilaf—and, of course, Montana's ubiquitous huckleberry cobbler, made with locally sourced huckleberries.Montana and beer just seem to go together, and there are plenty of craft breweries and taprooms to choose from on this route. Kalispell Brewing Company operates a taproom in Kalispell that specializes in German-style lagers and northwest-inspired ales (no food is sold, but feel free to bring in your own). Inside Tip: Hikers who like to imbibe along the way can take out a 64-ounce growler or 32-ounce “grunt” filled with their favorite brew. In Whitefish, Bonsai Brewing Project operates a beer garden, and Great Northern Brewing Company holds a Hop Swap, for which locals are invited to trade in their locally sourced hops for beer.Whitefish Pottery offers guided tours and demonstrations at its studios near Whitefish. The highlight of the year is the firing of the largest anagama (wood-fired, sloping kiln built on a hill) in the state. Only fired once annually, it demonstrates the oldest way of firing pottery—with wood—and requires five days to load, five days to fire (working 24/7), and a week to cool down before unloading.To gear up for adventure and dress for the west, head to locally owned Sportsman and Ski Haus, with stores in both Kalispell and Whitefish, for seasonal sporting goods, repairs, rentals, and demonstrations. Western Outdoor in Kalispell boasts more than 3,000 pairs of boots and more than 2,000 cowboy and casual hats in their stock.The Shops at Station 8, housed in an old Great Northern Railroad Station in Columbia Falls, specializes in vintage goods, including Montana sapphires, handmade candles, barn-wood shelving, and copper keepsake ornaments.The place to buy, or simply look at, museum-quality Native American art and artifacts is the Montana Fur Trading Company in Martin City. See beadwork, jewelry, furs, and other goods in multiple themed rooms.Whitefish Gallery Nights take place the first Thursday of each month from spring through fall, when about a dozen local galleries in Whitefish open their doors to show off new talent. Hit the galleries, which open at 6 p.m., for exhibitions and receptions (each participating gallery is identified with an “Art Spot” flag outside, and there are brochures with maps at each one).The Great Northwest Oktoberfest covers two weekends of fun in September and October. The event blends the best of Old Germany and the Wild West, bringing some of the greatest polka and oompah bands in the U.S. and Canada to the Oktoberfest Bigtop in Whitefish Depot Park. Beer-fueled contests include waitress races, log sawing, stein holding, and keg hurling.Glacier has a sophisticated transportation system throughout the park, which also serves as a way to tour the area. The ubiquitous Red Buses have canvas tops that roll back, giving riders unobstructed views of the Glacier scenery while they listen to commentary by tour drivers. Wooden boats ply the park’s bigger lakes. For a Native American take on the history, culture, and spirituality of Glacier—which the Blackfeet call the Backbone of the World—go with Sun Tours, a Native American-owned national park concessioner.Whitefish Mountain Resort operates in both winter and summer, giving visitors to the summit of its mountain views of the peaks of Glacier National Park, the entire Flathead Valley, and most of Whitefish Lake, the Cabinet Mountains, the Whitefish Range, the Swan Range, the Mission Mountains, and the Canadian Rockies. In winter, ride the lifts to a ski area that offers an average of more than an acre per person of space. In summer, a scenic lift takes guests up just for the view.For a unique side trip, head north from Columbia Falls on Outside North Fork Road/MT-486 for approximately 50 miles round-trip to the relatively less crowded North Fork area, an off-the-grid location with no pavement, power, or mobile phone service. The town of Polebridge boasts the historic Polebridge Mercantile, which houses a bakery specializing in huckleberry bear claws. Best Bet: The Polebridge Mercantile is the starting and ending point of the annual Le Grizz 50-mile ultramarathon on the second Saturday of October.It’s an easy 25-mile round-trip detour on the eastern side of the park from Kiowa onto U.S. 89 to Browning, then back on U.S. 2 to East Glacier. The highlight in Browning is the Museum of the Plains Indian. Best Bet: Head for the back, where Native American artists demonstrate authentic crafts, including weaving with porcupine quills, with their works for sale.Pick up Post Cards From Glacier National Park: A Vintage Post Card Book (Farcountry Press, 2006), a collection of 23 postcards offering views of the park’s history. Keep them as a souvenir or pull them out and snail mail them.The Winter Carnival and World Ski Joring Championships in Whitefish in January combines rodeo and snow. The premiere event is the ski-joring championship, during which entrants on skis are pulled around a closed snow course by horses and mules.For those who want a gentler, quieter winter activity, take a two-hour ranger-led snowshoe trek from Apgar Visitor Center through parts of the park.Gathering wild huckleberries is a Montana summer pastime, but the way to make sure you can savor the flavor is by ordering huckleberry pie at the Huckleberry Patch restaurant in Hungry Horse.On MT-2, two and a half miles southeast of Walton Ranger Station outside Glacier National Park, turn off at the exit for the Goat Lick. Park and walk to a platform from which you may be able to see mountain goats and other animals on a riverbank, there to lick the mineral-rich cliffs.Day One: Kalispell, Whitefish (Detour to North Fork)Day Two: Kalispell, Whitefish to Glacier National ParkDay Three: Glacier National ParkDay Four: East Glacier to Kalispell, Whitefish (Detour to Browning)Day Five: Kalispell, Whitefish",
"Summer. Road rehabilitation occurring on portions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road before and after the core summer season with possible closures. (Mid-June to mid-September delays will be limited to a maximum of 30-40 minutes during a one-way trip across Logan Pass.) All of Going-to-the-Sun Road is open about mid-June to mid-September; Chief Mountain International Highway, mid-May to late September. Trails at lower elevations are usually clear of snow by mid-June; higher trails can remain snowed-in until mid-July. Cross-country skiing is popular from December to April in areas of the park.Approach West Glacier (from Kalispell, Montana, about 35 miles) and East Glacier Park from US 2. US 89 leads to Many Glacier and St. Mary in the east; US 89 and Mont. 17 (Chief Mountain International Hwy.) form the shortest connection between Glacier and Waterton Lakes. Coming from Canada, follow Alberta 2, 5, or 6. Amtrak trains from Chicago and Seattle stop year-round just outside the park at West Glacier (Belton), Essex, Browning, and East Glacier Park; by prior arrangement, buses take travelers into the park. Nearest airports: Kalispell and Great Falls, Montana; and Lethbridge, Alberta.Spend your first day on and around the Going-to-the-Sun Road, considered by many one of the world’s most spectacular highways. On a second day, travel the Chief Mountain International Highway north to Waterton Lakes, enjoying the contrast of peak and prairie. Drive Waterton’s Akamina Parkway and Red Rock Parkway. Stay at least another day to visit Glacier’s Many Glacier. For a longer visit, drive to Two Medicine for a boat ride and walk to an exquisite lake, then continue on to the Walton Goat Lick Overlook, both also in Glacier. If you have the stamina and overnight reservations, hike or ride horseback to one of the two remaining chalets built in Glacier early in the 20th century by the Great Northern Railway.Glacier boasts a wide variety of lodging options, including full-service lodges, remote campgrounds, backcountry chalets, and motor inns.Many Glacier Hotel, a Swiss-themed hotel on the shores of Swiftcurrent Lake inside the park, is a great home base for excursions to Grinnell Glacier.Lake McDonald Lodge offers guest rooms, cottages, and a motor inn on the shores of Glacier's largest lake.Sperry Chalet can only be reached by hiking one of several trails that lead to the chalet (the shortest route, Sperry Trail, is 6.7 miles long), but guests will be greeted with hearty meals, homey lodgings, and sweeping views of Lake McDonald.Frontcountry campgrounds generally operate on a first-come, first-served basis, though two campgrounds may be reserved in advance.Backcountry campgrounds are maintained along many of the park's popular hiking trails. A Backcountry Use Permit is required for all overnight camping, and fees are charged per person, per night. Reserve a campground ahead of time, or drop by one of the backcountry permit-issuing stations before setting out.Glacier's rugged terrain is as challenging as it is beautiful, so make sure you have the proper gear before hitting the trail. Plan ahead so that you know how much food and water to bring, and make sure you are wearing appropriate footwear. The weather can change quickly in the mountains, so be prepared for an unexpected storm or cold front.Glacier encompasses hundreds of beautiful lakes and streams. Be cautious around swift glacial streams, moss-covered rocks, and slippery logs. Waterfalls and rivers can be extremely treacherous.Spotting wildlife is always exciting, but wild animals—even fluffy marmots and mountain goats—can be very dangerous. Be cautious when photographing animals, and always stay at a safe distance. Don't approach or try to pet any wildlife.Bears and mountain lions are generally elusive. If surprised by humans, these large animals can be extremely dangerous. Avoid startling them by announcing your presence and making plenty of noise on the trail. Never feed wild animals, and be cautious when storing food in campsites.www.nps.gov/glac",
"The center of Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring steams at 199° Fahrenheit (93° Celsius), too hot for the multicolored bacteria clustering on the cooler perimeter. But dead center is no dead zone: Billions of organisms called thermophiles flourish in the scalding water.Established: 1872Size: 2.2 million acresAnnual Visitors: 4.1 millionVisitor Centers: Mammoth, Canyon, Fishing Bridge, Grant Village, Old FaithfulEntrance Fees: $30 per vehicle, $15 per personnps.gov/yell; nps.gov/grteIf ever a park had a flair for the dramatic it’s Yellowstone—geysers, grizzlies, and its very own Grand Canyon, as well as trendy towns and backcountry trails that rarely see human bootprints. After all these years, the world’s very first national park is still one of the most imposing, a blend of land and water, forest and field, wildlife and geothermal features that often seem to be living things.It seems remarkable in hindsight that politicians recognized the uniqueness of Yellowstone—and suggested that steps be taken to preserve such an incredible landscape—at the very time that America was realizing its manifest destiny by “conquering” much of the West.A golden spike had finished the first transcontinental railroad just three years earlier and the Little Big Horn was still four years in the future when Ulysses S. Grant created Yellowstone National Park with the flourish of his pen in March 1872. The president was acting at the request of geologist Ferdinand V. Hayden, who had surveyed the region the previous summer. The genius of his expedition was including a photographer and landscape painter who rendered images of the Yellowstone countryside to show those in Washington exactly what needed saving. In fact, without the benefit of such images, a previous expedition was rebuffed by magazine editors who said their accounts of the Yellowstone region were too far-fetched to be believed.Yet when we look at those early photos and paintings today, it’s as if nothing has changed in the century and a half since Yellowstone was established. And that’s the enduring appeal of the park: a large, unspoiled canvas of the American West. In the words of Hayden, “remarkable curiosities which have required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to prepare.” (Explore this ultimate Yellowstone road trip.)A bison rests in the snow in Yellowstone, around Upper Geyser Basin.Tucked up on the northwest corner of Wyoming with parts spilling over into Montana and Idaho, the massive park offers five different approaches that feed into the Grand Loop Road, a figure-eight highway in the middle of the park. Rather than a single focus, Yellowstone has five main hubs—Old Faithful, Grant Village, Lake Village, Canyon Village, and Mammoth Hot Springs—each of them linked to a unique geological or geographical phenomenon.The most impressive entry is from Gardiner, Montana, in the northwest, a road that ducks beneath the famous Roosevelt Arch and meanders along the Gardiner River to Mammoth Hot Springs and the park headquarters. Albright Visitor Center is located in the historic bachelor officers’ quarters of old Fort Yellowstone, where the U.S. Cavalry kept watch over the park before the National Park Service was born. That sulfur smell that permeates the air is from the hot springs, a cluster of limestone travertine terraces that cascade down a hillside like a steaming waterfall.From Mammoth, the Great Loop Road shoots due east to the Tower-Roosevelt area and the broad Lamar Valley, the best place in Yellowstone to get a glimpse of the wolves that were reintroduced to the park in 1995. Bison and elk also frequent the valley with its lush grasslands. Veering in a southward direction, the road runs past 132-foot Tower Fall and the start of the Mount Washburn Trail (6.2-mile round-trip) to the summit of a 10,243-foot peak with a fire lookout tower that provides a spectacular view over just about all of Yellowstone.As the name implies, Canyon Village lies on the edge of the park’s biggest “ditch”—the gaping Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone—an immense multicolored trench that stretches 24 miles and rises as much as 1,200 feet above the Yellowstone River. Trails lead to outstanding viewpoints like Artist’s Point on the south rim and Lookout Point on the north rim, two of the best places to snap selfies with 308-foot Lower Yellowstone Falls as a backdrop. Canyon Visitor Education Center in the village revolves around the park’s geology and the supervolcano that underlies Yellowstone.Continuing the clockwise journey around the Grand Loop, the road climbs up the river valley to Yellowstone Lake. The largest high-altitude lake in North America, the sky-blue pool offers the park’s best opportunities for boating, fishing, and waterfront camping. Given the lake’s chilly water, even during the height of summer, swimming is discouraged. Bridge Bay Marina offers rental boats, guided fishing charters, and scenic lake cruises, as well as shuttle services to remote campsites along the 141-mile lakeshore. (See all U.S. national parks in photos.)Perched on the lake’s West Thumb, busy little Grant Village lies at the junction of the Loop Road and the highway running up from the South Entrance and Grand Teton. In addition to another visitor center, the village hosts several stores, a gas station, a boat ramp, and an amphitheater with summer ranger programs.Turning to the west, the Grand Loop cuts across the Continental Divide (and into the Pacific drainage) at two different points before cruising downhill into Old Faithful Village and the park’s largest cluster of visitor services. Opened in 1904, Old Faithful Inn is a masterpiece of national park rustic architecture, in particular the lobby with its massive yet cozy stone fireplace and soaring timber ceiling.The main event is just outside: Old Faithful Geyser, which erupts around 17 times per day to an average height of 130 feet. Visitors can learn more about the geothermal forces at the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center and then hike the Upper Geyser Basin along the Firehole River, home to around 60 percent of the world’s geysers. Curving around to the west, the road continues to other geothermal wonders like the Midway Geyser Basin and its Grand Prismatic Spring and the Lower Geyser Basin with its Fountain Paint Pot.Madison features an information station and bookstore at the junction where the highway from West Yellowstone in Idaho joins up with the main park road. The Grand Loop continues to the Norris Geyser Basin, where geological wonders like Artist Paint Pots, Roaring Mountain, and Steamboat Geyser are complemented by the indoor exhibits of the Museum of the National Park Ranger and Norris Geyser Basin Museum with its distinctive 1920s “parkitecture.” Visitors can also explore the eerie Norris-Canyon Blowdown with its ghost trees or fly fish for trout in the swift-flowing Gibson River.Hotels • Old Faithful Inn: The world’s largest log structure is an icon of American national park architecture; restaurants, bar, shop.• Lake Yellowstone Hotel: The Greek Revival facade of the park’s oldest hotel overlooks the lake; restaurants, bar, shop.• Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel: Established in 1937, this classic motor lodge features motel-style rooms and cabins; restaurant, shop, map room.Camping • Yellowstone: The park includes 12 developed campgrounds, including Mammoth, Canyon, and Grant Village.• Ranger-led activities include guided snowshoe walks through the colder months at Mammoth, Old Faithful, and West Yellowstone.• Cross-country ski trails are located at six places within Yellowstone.• Guided snowmobile and snowcoach tours are allowed on Yellowstone roadways during the winter “snowover” months when they are closed to motorized traffic.• Yellowstone Forever offers unique cold season programs like Wolves in Winter and a winter landscape photography field seminar.",
"There are few people living who know Yellowstone better than Jeremy Schmidt. The Jackson Hole, Wyoming-based writer and photographer has spent 40 years as a ranger, “winterkeeper,” and guide in the park.The author of more than a dozen books, Schmidt is a longtime contributor to National Geographic magazine and a popular trip leader and expert for National Geographic Expeditions. Here’s his insider’s guide to America’s very first national park.Autumn is the best time to visit because large animals like elk and bison are in their prime and geysers and hot springs seem more powerful in the cool air. The days are warm, but nights are frosty. Biting insects disappear, as do the crowds of summer.My park’s biggest attraction is Old Faithful and the geysers around it, but a visit isn’t complete without seeing Yellowstone Lake and the Yellowstone River flowing north from it through Hayden Valley.If I could offer one practical tip for optimizing your visit, it would be to get out early in the day. In summer, you avoid the crowds but any time of year, morning is the best for wildlife viewing and gorgeous scenery.My favorite “park secret” is Storm Point Trail, on the north shore of Yellowstone Lake–an easy walk through meadow and forest to an excellent view of the lake and a good chance to see a variety of wildlife.Watch out for fast-changing weather, and be sure to bring sunblock and rain gear when you come for a visit. You’re likely to need both.Head to Hayden Valley and Lamar Valley if you want to see wildlife. If you’re really lucky, you’ll spot a wolf, grizzly bear, badger, otter, or mountain lion. You can’t count on seeing one, but you know they are all there.For the best view in the park, head to the top of Mount Washburn. It’s a moderate hike on what was once a vehicle road. Not keen on walking? Lake Butte Overlook, on the east entrance road, offers a fine panorama of Yellowstone Lake and, far in the distance, the Teton Range.Trails that follow the north and south rims of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone are the best easy-to-moderate trails in the park; dizzying views of the canyon at every turn. The road through Lamar Valley to Cooke City is the most scenic drive, especially if you add the jaw-dropping beauty of the Beartooth Highway, just outside the northeast entrance.If you’re up for an adventure/physical challenge, try a backpacking trip to the Thorofare region, in Yellowstone’s most remote southeast corner.To experience the park’s cultural side, take a historic walking tour of old Fort Yellowstone, headquarters of the U.S. Cavalry when it ran the park from 1886 to 1916.Old Faithful Inn, for its historic experience and unique log architecture, is the best place to stay while you’re visiting, and Lake Hotel dining room is the best place to eat dinner; follow that up with a lakeside sunset stroll.If you only have one day to spend in the park, make sure to hit Old Faithful, Yellowstone Lake, and Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.If you’re interested in a guided tour, I recommend Alpen Guides in West Yellowstone, or Off the Beaten Path in Bozeman. For short excursions, try a historic Yellow Bus tour (refurbished touring vehicles produced by the White Motor Company), now operated by Xanterra. I recommend going in the evening.The most peaceful place in the park has to be the Bechler area, in the park’s southwest corner; a roundabout drive to get there.If you have kids (or are a kid at heart), you won’t want to miss the Firehole Canyon swimming hole.Just outside park boundaries, you can visit Grand Teton National Park, to the south; Buffalo Bill Center of the West to the east, in Cody; or Harriman State Park, in the floor of a volcanic caldera, just west of the park in Idaho.If my park had a mascot it would be a grizzly bear cub.The eruption of Steamboat Geyser, the world’s largest, could only happen in my park.The United States Army is an “unsung hero” of my park because in the uncertain days when no one knew what a national park should be, and the park lay open to all sorts of damaging exploitation, the Army rode to the rescue. It not only protected the park, but it established many of the principles governing all of our national parks today.In 140 characters or less, the world should heart my park because it was the first, and has become a fitting example for national parks around the world.Before you visit (or when you arrive), make sure to check out these great resources:",
"California's Yosemite  Valley—with stunners such as El Capitan, at left, and the Merced River—inspired  early European visitors to call for its protection.The national parks have been woven into the fabric of American life for so many generations that it’s hard to imagine the nation without them.But the decision to set these special places aside was not an obvious, or easy, one. No road map existed for the journey that created the national parks because no places quite like them existed anywhere in the world.The parks were born because in the mid-1800s a relatively small group of people had a vision—what writer Wallace Stegner has called “the best idea we ever had”—to make sure that America’s greatest natural treasures would belong to everyone and remain preserved forever.“Americans developed a national pride of the natural wonders in this nation and they believed that they rivaled the great castles and cathedrals of Europe,” explains David Barna, National Park Service Chief of Public Affairs.Yosemite was at the heart of America’s nascent national parks movement. The California valley’s splendor inspired some of its earliest European visitors to demand protection, even as settlers moved ceaselessly westward, “civilizing” the West and displacing native peoples.Elegant voices, like that of naturalist John Muir, brought the grandeur of such lands to those who had never seen them. His prolific and widely published writings stressed how such wild places were necessary for the soul, and his advocacy later became the driving force behind the creation of several national parks.Responding to such calls, Congress and President Abraham Lincoln put Yosemite under the protection of California during the Civil War. In 1872 Lincoln’s former general, President Ulysses S. Grant, made Yellowstone America’s—and the world’s—first truly national park. More parks soon followed suit and, beginning in the late 19th century, cultural sites like Arizona’s prehistoric Casa Grande were honored as well.President Theodore Roosevelt was one of the park system’s greatest patrons. During his administration (1901-09) five new parks were created, as well as 18 national monuments, four national game refuges, 51 bird sanctuaries, and over 100 million acres (40 million hectares) of national forest.But even as the number of parks swelled no central organization existed to manage them. Consequently, many lacked protection and funding. In the early 20th century the future character of the parks remained very much in doubt.Private commercial interests, including hotels, railroads, ranches, and sawmills, saw great profit potential in the parks and began to exploit their resources—often relatively unchecked.Some in government, like forester Gifford Pinchot, shared a utilitarian vision for the parks that included more than preservation. Pinchot and others suggested that the parks become part of a Forest Service that would promote the well-managed use of their timber and other resources to serve “the greatest good for the greatest number.” This philosophy led to the damming, in 1913, of Yosemite’s Hetch Hetchey Valley for the San Francisco water supply.But others preached preservation and lamented the lack of an overarching federal management that could make this possible. In 1915 a millionaire industrialist named Stephen Mather began a crusade to establish a distinct National Park Service dedicated to the preservation ideal. Mather garnered support from titans of industry, as well as schoolchildren, newspapers, and even the National Geographic Society. (See more about National Geographic and the national parks.)His efforts succeeded, and when the National Park Service was created in 1916, Mather became its first director and began work with a mandate to protect the parks “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations,” and to promote their use by all people.Sacrifices were made as the system grew to include today’s 392 national parks, monuments, battlefields, seashores, recreation areas, and other areas. Many native peoples were displaced and, when eastern parks like Shenandoah were created, so were settlements of U.S. citizens.But in the final analysis, America’s system of national parks became a unique triumph—and one that carries with it a great responsibility.“Never in its 200 years has this nation needed the National Park System more,” Barna says. “It stands as a collective memory of where we have been, what sacrifices we have made to get here, and who we mean to be. By investing in the preservation, interpretation, and restoration of these symbolic places, we offer hope and optimism to each generation of Americans.”",
"The vibrant Grand Prismatic Spring is Yellowstone’s largest hot spring.America’s oldest national park includes 2.2 million acres of forests, lakes, and mountains. Heat and volcanic activity from the depths of Earth power this dramatic landscape, evidenced by its geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs.Whether you have two days or two weeks, a road trip is the perfect way to explore Yellowstone National Park’s natural wonders at your own pace. The park can be accessed from five different gates in three different states: Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. These winding roads will lead you through sublime vistas and past abundant wildlife, including elk, bison, grizzlies, black bear, pronghorn antelope, moose, and bighorn sheep. But perhaps best of all is the opportunity to witness the eternally mesmerizing, bubbling, gurgling, steaming earth.The rushing Yellowstone River slices through one of the park’s canyons.Yellowstone has countless vantage points with views of Yellowstone Lake, forests, rivers, and waterfalls. The observation decks at Artist Point, a short walk from the parking lot on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, offer a stunning view of the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River. The canyon is marked by steep white-and-yellow cliffs and its vents and spires reveal thermal activity that continues unabated underground. The falls are an equally dazzling site from Lookout Point on the North Rim. If you have time to spare, a trail hike is an essential part of the adventure.Few sights in Yellowstone match that of watching Old Faithful: a huge plume of steam and water gushing out of the ground and shooting 100-184 feet into the air. Perch on one of several wooden boardwalks built around the geyser and watch it erupt with your camera in hand. With its reliable eruption times (every 60 to 110 minutes) it’s easy to plan a visit to witness a blowout. Afterwards, the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center offers a quick lesson on the geology behind the world’s most famous geyser.Visitors take in the scenic view at Mammoth Hot Springs, where wooden boardwalks wind through the landscape.On a slow drive-through of the Mammoth Hot Springs area, visitors can see the churning thermal landscape and grazing elk right from the car. Venture out onto the network of wooden boardwalks that wind their way through a multitude of travertine terraces with abstract shapes and contours. Colors change as heat and minerals combine, and bacteria and algae transform the pools and surfaces. A two-hour walk along the Lower Terrace Interpretive Trail is a good way to imbibe the essence of this park.A herd of bison move through one of Yellowstone's valleys at sunset.Although smaller than some of the others, West Thumb Geyser Basin is a spectacular must-see. In this small area on the edge of Yellowstone Lake, it’s easy to view all the thermal features that make this park so unique. Hot springs, bubbling pools, mud pots, fumaroles and lakeshore geysers empty into the lake’s chilly waters. Outstanding features include Abyss Pool, a 53-foot-deep blue pond, and Fishing Cone, a submerged geyser that becomes visible only in the summer when lake water levels drop. Time permitting, make a stop at Norris Geyser Basin, a short distance south of Mammoth Hot Springs. It’s home to the world’s tallest active geyser and a colorful display caused by the combination of various minerals and the lifeforms that exist in the torrid environment.To get to the Grand Prismatic Spring, Yellowstone’s largest hot spring, drive to Midway Geyser Basin and then walk along the boardwalk. Through the steam rising off the surface, a large turquoise pool ringed with orange and yellow comes into view like a dream. Temperatures around the pool are high, especially during the summer. The rainbow colors are best viewed from a height—take a slightly strenuous hike up the Midway Bluff trail for the perfect vantage point.Yellowstone highlights that are worth the detours are Lamar Valley for its wildlife, and the Morning Glory Pool on the outer areas of the Upper Geyser Basin for its teal and orange waters. Firehole Canyon Drive, which skirts the edge of a cliff along the Firehole River, makes for another interesting drive. Swimming is possible here because the boiling hot spring water meets the cold snowmelt of the river, bringing it to a bearable temperature.Old Faithful Inn: A stone’s throw from Old Faithful geyser, this landmark, lodgepole pine hotel exudes warmth and old-world charm.Old Faithful Snowlodge and Cabins: This stylish hotel was made with numerous recycled and repurposed materials as well as wood.Lake Yellowstone Hotel:This is the oldest lodging in the park going back 126 years, but has recently been renovated in art deco style. Though on the banks of Yellowstone Lake, most rooms don’t actually overlook it, but wildlife can be seen roaming near the building.Lake Lodge Cabins: Not far from the Lake Yellowstone Hotel is another set of charming historic cabins with front porches and rocking chairs. Two fireplaces in the lobby keep the place warm and inviting.Lone Mountain Ranch: A National Geographic Unique Lodge, this clutch of Old West cabins nestles in a forested valley 18 miles upstream of Yellowstone and offers guided horseback, canoe, and cross-country ski trips.",

Bring binoculars to scan for wildlife.Side Drive: Antelope Flats Road leads to Mormon Row, where a cluster of homesteads dates to the 1890s.Oddity: The thermally heated waters of Kelly Warm Spring host a population of tropical fish released from aquariums.Before You Come: Read Wapiti Wilderness by Margaret and Olaus Murie.Park Website: www.nps.gov/grteSeasonal Notes: Summer is peak season in the Tetons for a reason—the crisp, sunny weather is perfect. To avoid the crowds consider coming in September, when afternoons are often still warm. Spring can be wet but rich in wildlife. Highway 191 is open year-round; Teton Park Road and other park roads are only open from May 1 through October 31.Yes, Yellowstone has a wealth of geysers—more than anyplace else on Earth—but it also hosts the massive waterfalls of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the profuse wildlife of the Hayden and Lamar Valleys, the volcanic peaks of the Absaroka Range, and the scintillating sprawl of Yellowstone Lake, the largest high-elevation lake in North America. There’s a reason this was the world’s first national park. The famed Grand Loop Road runs a figure eight through the park’s best sights.The Route: Grand Teton > Grand Loop Road > Gardiner, MTOn the Way: See live wolves and grizzly bears at the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center in West Yellowstone. A nearby IMAX theater shows excellent films on the park.Stay: Built with lodgepole pines felled in the park and featuring a 500-ton stone fireplace, the historic Old Faithful Inn is a masterwork of rustic “parkitecture.” With seven stories and 327 rooms, it’s the largest log structure in the world. Rooms start at $108 and its namesake geyser erupts just outside. For a more remote experience, Roosevelt Lodge Cabins in the Lamar Valley has wood-burning stoves and offers wagon rides to evening cookouts. Cabins start at $80.Eat: For a taste of colonial elegance, the stately dining room at the Lake Yellowstone Hotel features fine dining with views across Yellowstone Lake. For a budget-friendly, once-in-a-lifetime experience, watch Old Faithful erupt over lunch at the Old Faithful Lodge Cafeteria.Don’t Miss: The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone has two heart-pounding perches. The paved, half-mile Brink of the Lower Falls Trail leads to the precipice of the 308-foot cataract, where the viewing platform actually trembles. Across the canyon, you’ll never hike anything like the 328 metal steps of Uncle Tom’s Trail, ending at a thunderous cliffside platform where you can literally feel the power of the falls.Jaw-Dropping Viewpoints: Most people miss Lake Butte Overlook, which offers the park’s best car-accessed view of Yellowstone Lake and the surrounding mountains. It sits on the edge of the massive volcanic caldera, the ongoing simmering of which produces the park’s myriad geysers and thermal features. Watch the sunset near Buffalo Ranch in the wide, wild Lamar Valley. This is when the wolf packs and grizzlies are often afoot and when the Absaroka Mountains are gilded with honeyed light.Side Drive: The two-mile road through Firehole Canyon leads past the 800-foot walls of an ancient lava flow to a waterfall and spring-warmed swimming hole.Oddity: Straddling the Continental Divide, Isa Lake has two outlets—one flows to the Pacific, the other to the Atlantic.Before You Come: Read Searching for Yellowstone by Paul Schullery.Park Website: www.nps.gov/yell/Seasonal Notes: The Grand Loop Road begins opening on May 1, and all segments of the road but one are closed by November 1. The exception is the Dunraven Pass, which closes in October. May is great for wildlife watching, but rain is common. The sunny days and cool nights of summer are peak season; get early-morning starts to beat the multitudes. The cooler weather and lighter crowds of autumn, when many animals begin gathering in the valleys, can be perfect, though winter can arrive at any time.One of our wildest national parks and a hiking playground nonpareil, the wild and majestic high country of Glacier Park is laced with dirt ribbons leading to glaciers, waterfalls, and alpine meadows bursting with wildflowers. The few roads are equally magnificent, crowned by the Continental Divide crossing Going-to-the-Sun Road, one of America’s most beautiful drives.The Route: Gardiner > Montana 89 > US 90 > Montana 287 > Montana 89 > Montana 2 > East GlacierOn the Way: Viewing the planetarium and world-class dinosaur exhibits at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, just north of Yellowstone, is a fascinating way to spend an afternoon. Spend the night in an authentic tepee at the Lodgepole Gallery and Tipi Village on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation outside of Browning, Montana, near Glacier’s east entrance.Stay: With its massive Douglas fir columns and campfire-style central fireplace, the grandly rustic Many Glacier Hotel echoes a bygone era in park history. So do the small, simple rooms, but the balcony views across Swiftcurrent Lake at sunset are the park’s ultimate luxury. Rates start at $165. A 6.7-mile hike vaults over 3,000 feet up from Lake McDonald to the stone and cedar Sperry Chalet, built in 1913 amid mountain goats and glaciers. One of only two remaining alpine chalets in the park, its rooms start at $204 for one person (includes three meals per day).Eat: Just outside the park boundary at West Glacier, inside the historic, Swiss-style Belton Chalet, the Belton Grill offers organic produce and an extensive wine list. The adjacent taproom has Montana beers and more budget-friendly fare. For a more frontier-style dining experience, head up the long, dirt road into the North Fork of the Flathead Valley, where the Northern Lights Saloon and Cafe serves elk burgers and huckleberry pie in a century-old homesteader’s cabin.Don’t Miss: The best place to see one of the park’s disappearing glaciers from a road is Jackson Glacier Overlook on Going-to-the-Sun Road’s east side, where a view deep into the headwaters of the Saint Mary River reveals the vestigial slab of ice hugging the northern slopes of Mount Jackson. Visible from the road’s west side, the main plunge of Bird Woman Falls spills 560 feet out of a spectacular hanging valley.Tour: For a Native American perspective on the history and ecology of the park, Sun Tours offers guided drives along Going-to-the-Sun-Road, led by local Blackfeet tribal members.Jaw-Dropping Viewpoints: From Logan Pass, walk 1.5 miles across a carpet of alpine wildflowers and the Continental Divide to the Hidden Lake Overlook, where an aquamarine lake suddenly appears in a deep glacial cirque beneath muscular peaks. Sun Point along Saint Mary Lake is a lakeside picnic spot with magnificent views into the knife-edged summits of the Continental Divide.Side Drive: Head north from Apgar up the Camas Road, where a sometimes rough dirt road leads into the North Fork of the Flathead Valley, a wild, off-the-grid enclave where the historic Polebridge Mercantile serves heavenly baked goods and Bowman Lake makes for a gloriously picturesque late-summer swimming hole. Plan at least half a day for the adventure.Oddity: Water pours forth from the Weeping Wall on the west side of Going-to-the-Sun Road, cascading over vehicles in early summer.Before You Come: Read Crown of the Continent by Ralph Waldt and Fools Crow by James Welch.Park Website: www.nps.gov/glacSeasonal Notes: Going-to-the-Sun Road, the park’s foremost attraction, typically opens in full in early June and normally closes in mid-October, though timing varies and may be affected by construction schedules. Some portions of the road remain open year-round. Though Glacier generally avoids the crowds that can plague Yellowstone and Teton, the parking lot at Logan Pass can fill up in midsummer, when early starts are essential. The park’s Going-to-the-Sun Road shuttle service, free with park entry, is an excellent solution. As is coming in September, when crowds thin and a kaleidoscope of color paints the high country.",
"“Wolf by the river. Stop!” screamed Emily, a fellow traveler who sat across from me in the snow coach. Minutes earlier I had asked our driver if there was any chance we’d spot a wolf. “Quite frankly, I doubt it,” she replied. “Although Yellowstone is home to about 100 wolves, spread across 12-13 packs, they wander across 2.2 million acres,” she explained. Like a damp mist from the geysers, disappointment had seeped into the warm coach, weighing us down.We were eight serious wildlife watchers who had made the trek to the park in December’s icy grip, determined to see wolves. Armed with binoculars and spotting scopes, we searched all morning in Lamar Valley—the best place to observe wolves—with no success.Then, as the sun was getting low in the sky, we got lucky. There he was on the bank of the rushing Lamar River—a six-foot-long lone wolf shaking water from his tawny fur like a wet dog. We watched as the majestic, muscular male circled an immense elk carcass until he settled on a rib to chew.He paused, raising his head to sniff the air, and I imagined, for one perfect moment, that his amber eyes met mine. Seeing a wolf—once poisoned and hunted to the brink of extinction in the continental United States—free and healthy was really cool.If you’re looking for the rebounding carnivores, Yellowstone is a good place. And winter provides the best odds of seeing them.In summer, wolves tend to stay in the woods, away from the hot sun, and blend into the landscape when they do venture out. But against the snow, romping pups and their parents stand out in stark relief.Long, flat Lamar Valley has been called “America’s Serengeti” because it is home to a dizzying array of wildlife, including wolves, grizzlies, elk, bison, moose, and eagles. “Bison on the left, elk on the right,” was the rallying cry during our morning wildlife viewing session.This was not always the case. In 1880, less than a decade after Yellowstone was established as America’s first national park, superintendent Philetus Norris observed that while wolves were once universally prevalent in the park, “the value of their hides and the easy slaughter with strychnine-poisoned carcasses of animals have nearly led to their extermination.”In fact, wolves were absent from Yellowstone from 1926 until 1995 when 14 were captured in Western Canada and released within park bounds. Today, two decades after reintroduction efforts began, wolf numbers are stable. But the issue of wolf management continues to be a hot topic.“The competition between wolves and ranchers [living around the park] can cause real and significant financial hardship for families who depend upon livestock for their living,” Carolyn Harwood, a resident instructor at the Yellowstone Association Institute, explained.As Charlie, a Montana rancher sipping a beer at the bar at Chico Hot Springs Resort 30 miles from the park entrance, told me: “A little ‘woof’ in the park is OK. A lot of ‘woof’ killing cattle outside the park is not.”Yet research shows that the reintroduction of wolves has affected Yellowstone ecosystems in complex ways. For instance, elk, whose population growth exploded in the absence of predators, overgrazed cottonwoods, willows, and other key plant species along park riverbeds. When the wolves returned, elk moved into valleys and gorges to avoid predation, allowing trees and bushes to regenerate. Beavers, in turn, experienced a resurgence, as did muskrats, otters, duck, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. There was a surge in songbirds due to increased nesting areas in willows.As Carolyn explained, this cascading effect shows the apex predator theory at work. “Having wolves back in Yellowstone makes the park a wild, whole ecosystem again,” she said.One of the most photographed views in Zion National Park, and perhaps all of the parks, is the view of the Watchman from the Canyon Junction Bridge. Although it has been shot endless times, and you are sure to be shoulder to shoulder with other photographers during sunset, it is still something everyone must do when visiting the park. My favorite spot is right at the center of the bridge where the river leads the eye to the Watchman in the background.Unfortunately, wolves continue to suffer from an image problem, borne, at least in part, from their appearance as evil antagonists in fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. “And yet, there has never been a recorded instance of a healthy, wild wolf attacking a human in the USA,” Carolyn noted.One of Yellowstone’s greatest winter assets is its lack of visitors. Cold weather means that curious travelers can experience moments of solitude at the park’s many geothermal attractions and that avid shutterbugs have a chance to capture snow-covered bison—or a wolf or three—framed by icicle-laden branches.You can even experience Old Faithful alone. After dinner one evening, two friends and I bulked up in layers of down and fleece and took to the boardwalks leading to the park’s most famous geyser. At times we turned off our flashlights to take in the brilliance of the stars far from any source of light pollution. Suddenly, the reliable gusher began to hiss and puff. Witnessing the eruption in the still of night was haunting and majestic.During the winter season, Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel are the only accommodations available within park boundaries. Note: There is one plowed road from Mammoth Hot Springs to Lamar Valley that is open in the winter. Transportation elsewhere within the park is limited to snowmobiles and enclosed heated snow coaches.Yellowstone National Park Lodges offers an array of seasonally appropriate multiday packages for travelers.The Yellowstone Association, the park’s official nonprofit education partner, sponsors educational tours and field-based programs for individuals, families, and students, including “Wolf Week” courses every December and March that coincide with—and operate alongside—key park research efforts.In Lamar Valley, you may encounter a snarl of SUVs and tripod-toting wildlife watchers. They’re well-organized, passionate, and happy to share their viewing scopes as well as their knowledge about specific wolves. Many share information on a website dedicated to their wolf sightings (there’s an annual fee to access).If you are up for a physically challenging adventure, try cross-country skiing or snowshoeing on well-marked trails. I rented skis at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, caught a lift on a snow coach to the Lone Star Geyser trailhead, then skied to the backcountry geyser.Travel Tip: Put a hand-warmer in your pocket next to your camera or cell phone so the cold won’t zap the battery.Marybeth Bond is a freelance writer who writes for National Geographic Traveler, National Geographic Books, and other publications in addition to updating her Gutsy Traveler blog.

"Supervolcanoes are like the supervillains of the geologic world, as stories of their looming threat grow ever more exaggerated. Though massive eruptions do pose real dangers, misconceptions about them abound.According to the United States Geological Survey, a volcano is considered “super” if it has had at least one explosion that released more than 240 cubic miles of material—a little more than twice the volume of Lake Erie. That places it at a magnitude of eight, the highest ranking on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, or VEI, which is used to measure the explosiveness of an eruption.These are very large eruptions, the impacts of which would be widespread—from avalanches of hot rock and gasses racing down the volcano's flanks to global changes in climate. But there's an important caveat about supervolcanoes that most people commonly overlook: Just because a volcano has had a super-eruption once or even twice in its past doesn't mean its future eruptions will be just as big.What's more, very few volcanoes reach such a super-status. For the some 5,000 eruptions with an assigned VEI that took place during the last ten thousand years, not a single one ranked a VEI 8, according to the USGS. While dozens of volcanoes may be erupting around the world on any given day, scientists have identified just 42 eruptions that ranked a VEI 8 (or high 7) in the last 36 million years. (There's a little wiggle room in the number, because when judging historical events, it's difficult to estimate the extent of ejected material.)According to an investigation by volcanologist Erik Klemetti for Wired, the origins of the term “supervolcano” are far from scientific. It was used as far back as 1925 in the travelogue Conquering the World, by Helen Bridgeman. Since then, the term has taken a winding path to popularity.Klemetti, who now writes for Discover, notes that the initial geologic use of the term in the mid-1900s differs from its modern definition of a mega-eruption. Instead, many early citations used “supervolcano” in reference to an amalgamation of multiple volcanoes.By the late 1900s, the term was picking up steam. But it seemed to truly launch into the stratosphere after the 2000 BBC/Horizon documentary Supervolcanoes, and was subsequently buoyed by a 2005 docudrama created by the BBC and the Discovery Channel about the now infamous Yellowstone supervolcano. While the term still elicits eye rolls from many volcanologists, its popularity in the media has forced "supervolcano" into scientific realms.Yellowstone is now perhaps the most famous of the world's volcanoes that have produced VEI 8 eruptions. This geologic superstar has had at least three very large eruptions in its history: Two are super-eruptions that were VEI 8 (some 2.1 million and 640,000 years ago), and one eruption 1.3 million years ago was VEI 7, producing around 67 cubic miles of material.While the unfounded fear in a pending Yellowstone eruption has swirled for decades, the BBC and Discovery's 2005 docudrama forever tied the volcano to its super-moniker. The film depicted what would happen if the volcano erupted again with a magnitude as large as its blast some 2.1 million years ago, which produced roughly 588 cubic miles of material. While such an eruption in the distant future is possible, the probability of it happening in the next few thousand years is “exceedingly low,” according to the USGS.The magma lurking in Yellowstone's shallow reserve is between just 5 and 15 percent molten. An eruption usually requires at least 50 percent to gel in this gooey hot state. More likely than such an explosion is a lava flow—a spurt of slowly oozing molten rock. Although a lava flow can pose hazards for communities that lie in its path or spectators attempting to approach close enough to roast a marshmallow, those dangers are much easier to predict and avoid.A hot spring steams and bubbles in Yellowstone National Park, the surface manifestation of the caldera simmering below.There are many supervolcanoes around the world other than Yellowstone, including California's Long Valley, Japan's Aira Caldera, Indonesia's Toba, and New Zealand's Taupo. This latter supervolcano is the last to have ever released a super-eruption, which burst free some 26,500 years ago.Several volcanoes are commonly called “supervolcanoes” but their eruptions haven't quite earned them this super status. Take Krakatau's 1883 eruption for example. The explosions were so loud, they could be heard nearly 3,000 miles away on Rodriguez Island, and they triggered towering tsunami waves that killed more than 36,000 people. Still, even that beast rated at VEI 6.A volcano doesn't need to have a super-eruption to be dangerous; if people are nearby as it explodes, even small eruptions pose many hazards. That said, not all volcanic eruptions are dangerous. If an eruption takes place far from populations and flight paths, no one may even notice that the peak burst its top.Supervolcanoes can occur in many situations. Some, like Yellowstone, can be due to hot spots, rising plumes of magma from deep inside Earth. Hot spots generate a trail of volcanoes as the ever-moving tectonic plates slowly march across the largely stationary plume, like the lengthy chain of volcanoes of the Hawiian Islands.Others, like Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia, can form along subduction zones where one tectonic plate plunges beneath another. As the descending landmass sinks deep underground, temperatures and pressures climb, forcing the water from the rocks. That water reduces the melting point of the overlying rocks, forming magma that can fuel future eruptions.Regardless of how the magma forms, however, a volcano needs a lot of it to produce a super-eruption. As the magma builds, pressure in the underground cavity increases. A super-eruption requires tons of pressure to actually jettison the huge pockets of molten rock through the surface.In short, no.While a super-eruption would no doubt be devastating, it wouldn't be a world-ending affair. For an idea of the effects of such an eruption, we could look to the 1815 explosion of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. At a VEI of 7, this explosion was not quite a super-eruption, but it gives a sense of the many dangers of such mega-blasts.The explosion sent a superheated plume of hot ash and gas 28 miles into the air, upon its collapse producing searing avalanches known as pyroclastic flows. Such immediate hazards killed around ten thousand people, but that wasn't the only concern. The gasses and ash injected into the atmosphere darkened the skies, blotted out the sun, and altered the climate, resulting in what became known as the year without summer. Extensive crop failures, starvation, and disease followed, which killed around 82,000 more people.What's most important to keep in mind about modern eruptions is that agencies around the world are keeping a close watch on supervolcanoes like Yellowstone, monitoring their every tremor and magma-laden belch. Volcanoes provide some notice of pending eruption and modern equipment helps scientists take their pulse with more accuracy than ever before. So while a super-eruption in the near future is exceedingly unlikely, these agencies will be the first to know and alert the public if one ever becomes imminent.",
