0,"In modern society , especially in big cities , undoubtedly hard work has become a very important feature of ordinary people’s everyday life. It seems that many people are under the impression that their work is becoming more pressing and urgent , and thus they sacrifice more and more leisure time. In the first place , with the rapid development of science and technology , work today is more demanding than it used to be. For example , college graduates nowadays have to master English , computer science and driving skills before they can find decent jobs. People have to spend more time acquiring new techniques and skills. And their spare time tends to be fully occupied , not with leisure pursuit , but with work-related pursuits. In the second place , competition is becoming more intense. Many people feel anxious that they may be “laid-off” if they can’t work as hard as others. And they also feel at a disadvantage before new graduates. Therefore , it is understandable that people keep themselves involved in intensely hard work in order to preserve their positions. In my opinion , the worst aspect of this phenomenon is that the huge pressure of work will gradually affect people’s mental health. Excessively hard work means that people can never get rid of the fatigue of their work , even in their leisure time. This means that they can not enjoy a normal life. In a word , in modern society overwork is stealing our leisure time. however , I believe this problem will be settled eventually with the development of science and technology .,"
1,"There is much discussion nowadays as to whether or not the relation-ship between family members is as close as before. Diverse contributing factors can be identified. In the following , I would like to present my point of view. Great changes have taken place in family life along with the development of society. One of them is that the once-extended family tends to become smaller and smaller. Many children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time passes , children become emotionally estranged from their parents. Compared with the past , social competition is becoming increasingly fierce. People are urged to concentrate their efforts upon work , so that they can achieve success , or at least a good standard of living. As a result , they can’t afford to spend their leisure hours with their families. The importance of bonds of kinship is gradually fading from their minds. In addition , the availability of various kinds of recreational facilities also diverts people from enjoying chats with the members of their families. Their free time is mostly occupied by watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games. They come to lose interest in communicating with the other members of their families. In view of such alienation within families , urgent steps must be taken , in my opinion. For members of families who live away from one another , regular contact on the phone can bring them the care that they need. Family reunions on holidays or other important occasions can make a difference as well. For those living together , it is a good idea to take some time off work or recreation periods to spend more time with each other. In the final analysis , a close family relationship can surely be maintained as long as we realize the significant role it plays in our lives and attach importance to it .,"
